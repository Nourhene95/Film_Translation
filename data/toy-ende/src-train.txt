It's only been two months since you started playing the guitar.
But he already knows the scale...
C'mon, we need a change of pace.
Let's go swimming!
"Lucille" -Okay, here goes!
-Watch the ball!
So please buy your own melon roll.
It's the truth. I was called to the faculty office.
S-see you...
Hold it, Tanaka!
Yukio Tanaka of Grade 8B.
Please go to the faculty office immediately.
Listen, Tanaka-kun...
I don't think you're taking your job as umbrella monitor seriously.
Oh, no...
Daily life is a series of little jobs like this.
Maybe I should put this in your student report...
I'm disappointed in you, Tanaka-kun.
Wait, Tanaka-kun!
It's nothing.
We were kidding around and Tanabe-kun did a drop kick on me.
Tanaka-kun...
And naturally, I gave it back to him with a heel hold! So it's no big deal!
-Did you catch that game? -Yeah!
That was awesome!
You look glum, Koyuki!
Maho!
Maho, you sure eat a lot.
Shut up.
I'm hungry.
You'll gain weight.
You can have my fries.
Beck's first live performance has been set!
R-really?
How long is this going to continue?
I'll talk to him for you.
Okay, I'm going on deliveries, so make up for being late and work extra hard.
And don't forget to feed Page.
I'm off!
-He sure is strict. -Yeah.
Around strangers.
It's okay, I'll feed him.
-He's...
-You little-!
T-this is the last of it!
These aren't company documents!
They're Saito-san's personal treasure!
Treasure?
I mean, private collection.
Collection?
Koyuki, how long have you been working here?
-Since the end of summer break.
I want to repair the guitar Ryusuke-kun gave me.
That's why I don't want to see Ryusuke-kun until the guitar is fixed.
So, how much do you get paid?
Oh, umm...430 yen an hour.
Are you serious? !
That's crazy!
This new law sure is bad for the manufacturing industry.
-Saito-sama, this way please.
Thank you for waiting. Rie-chan!
Thank you for calling her.
-Oh, it's Ken-ken! -Rie-rie!
-I missed you sooo much!
-Me too!
What's with the get-up?
Caught a cold or something?
I'm in disguise!
But how'd you guess it was me?
You stand out too much.
Okay, it's starting!
Ryusuke-kun's guitar... Are those bullet marks? !
They're real.
Is that...
That guitar has a name... It's Lucille.
-Sounds like a woman's name.
It's a guitar with a past...
Ryusuke got it in some dangerous place. But...
It couldn't possibly have happened while he was performing? !
One, two!
Typhoon 24!
24-7!
24 hours straight!
BECK!
B-E-C-K!
We're gonna rush at you!
We're gonna send you flyin' head-first!
Lift up your heavy ass, now If you take off that stiff head you'll feel totally loose
This crazy, crazy world
You just have to Stage Dive or Die
Mind blower, a shower of sweat Run towards a new world, my life
Those who seek it will be rewarded Pass the hot shot, keep on coming, come on!
Blow your mind
Squeeze your sweat yeah
Blow your mind Squeeze your sweat
This...is Beck...
Koyuki-kun...
There's still more? !
-The guitar's fixed now. -Huh?
The one with the broken neck. I sent it out for repairs.
I-is that true?
You want to patch things up with Ryusuke, don't you?
Saito-san!
Now go, hurry!
Koyuki-kun... Deduction for leaving early.
I think this'll do.
If you notice something while playing it, just let me know.
Now I can see Ryusuke-kun!
Hey, Tanaka...
Hey, Tanaka. Lemme play that guitar.
What an awful sound...
suits you perfectly!
Hey, Masaru.
Forget it, Rikiya-kun.
The sound is the pits.
You laughed just now, didn't you?
-Don't act innocent!
No, I thought that tune was "Anarchy in Heaven"...
Recently, the Sex Handles-
Any complaints?
Didn't think so.
It was a piece of junk anyway.
Let's go, Masaru!
-How about New Burger?
Did you get it, Koyuki-kun?
Oh, good!
It's all fixed, then?
Actually, it's been slow here at Saito Paper Company, so getting the money to fix it was a bit hard.
But it was worth it to see you smiling again!
Saito-san...
Oh, you're welcome!
Mom used to say, "From that day on, Yukio was like someone possessed by the guitar, and played it every single day."
You were great at the concert!
Think so? !
I just looove your vocals, Chiba-kun!
We won't miss your next live performance!
Then I'll put you on the guest list!
Give me your names and numbers!
Hey, Ray!
I've gotta talk to you!
What?
What're you mad about all of a sudden? Wow!
Ryusuke-kun, you speak English!
That's so cool! Yeah.
I lived in New York for a long time. So I'm more used to English than Japanese.
-That's so cool! -That's so cool!
We've got to go to New York, too!
-Tell us where you used to live!
-Yeah!
We wanna visit it!
-Yay!
Those idiots!
I was looking for the ab machine I bought by mail order last night... and I finally found it!
Found what?
Look!
This is it...
The L48 Eddie gave to you!
Then the one I gave to Koyuki was... That was a fake one you got at the guitar shop in Queens!
Which means...
-Ryusuke-kun! -Ryusuke-kun!
Don't get tetanus!
Yukio!
I called Ryusuke too.
You're joking, right?
Oh, speak of the devil.
Maho... Did you really explain it to him?
I did!
Why am I running away? !
Oh, Koyuki!
Izumi-chan!
I spoke to Ryusuke-kun on the phone yesterday and he said to say hi.
Oh... Can you say hello from me, too?
All 9th graders will report to the gym for curriculum guidance.
I repeat...
-It's almost graduation.
I'll be lonely.
See you, Koyuki!
"Dear Koyuki-kun,"
"I've decided to stay here a bit longer, so please take care of Page!"
He's extending his stay again!
Southeast Asia must have something that lures grown men...
I haven't played yet!
Punk rockers hold their guitars low...
Awright!
Cripes!
I'd better go to sleep!
Eiji...
Look at him...
Didn't he make his band successful all by himself?
We just do things our way.
Umm... Ginger ale.
Hey, Koyuki!
Why'd you run away the other day?
Koyuki! Let's go up front!
Let's go concrete hell, human safari park escape
Ape in the brain, mass brain-washing operation, no thank you
Let's walk together, step in step, and we'll get stuck in the deep
-I-is this what rap is?
-I-is this what rap is? -We're at the rebellious age, free as we go -Huh?
-We're at the rebellious age, free as we go
This is no barrier, just what is important, nothing impure, just clear
No pressure at our pace

Foojin
Takes me cruisin'
Music that cuts through the wind, free form
Bullet holes in the body...
That's a creepy guitar...
The acoustic pick-up in the front is broken.
He has a Roger Mayer at his feet.
But... How is he getting such a sound?
Wow! Amazing!
-Hey, look at that poster!
-I'm gonna get a shot of it!
So this is where Ryusuke-kun grew up! Isn't it cool!
Another minute Feelin' so fine
You turn the freeze into warm light
Had a premonition I've been waitin' ever since
My world comin' down
It's got me spinnin' 'round
If you really wanna fly you gotta let go
Simply the most big sensation
(once you're here you won't go back)
She's really pretty One-eyed vision

Woman: oh, thank you. Thank you for curing me, dr.
Freud.
Thanks to your miracle technique,
I am no longer delusional. It's called hypnosis, fraulein.
I took you back to re-Experience your childhood.
Whatever you did, it worked. I used to think that little men were following me around,
But now i know that little men Were just in meine imagination.
[Doorbell rings] Ach. Excuse me, fraulein.
You stand lookout while i write my name
In dr.
Now, fraulein, where were we? Aaah!
The little men! The little men! They're back!
Bl-Bl-Bl-Bl-Bl-Bl... aaah!
Hmm. You know, you might want to think about another appointment.
Aah! What are we going to do now, brain?
Ring some more doorbells and run away? No, pinky. Ohh!
To see the great hypnotizing psychiatrist
Dr. Sigmund freud.
Oh, bravo, brain.
You're finally getting some help
For that problem of yours--
Look, pinky, i'll explain this one more time. My appointment with dr.
Freud is only a ruse. When he tries to hypnotize me,
I will use a pair of mirrored glasses to reverse the process,
Thereby hypnotizing freud himself. Egad! Brilliant, brain!
Then you can make him wear a lovely dress and act like a monkey.
Pinky, how would that possibly help us
To take over the world?
Well, actually, i was thinking of it
More as entertainment. Poit.
All vienna knows that the emperor franz josef
Is being treated by freud for depression.
When freud is under my spell... unh! I will order him to hypnotize the emperor Into giving me, the brain,
His right to the imperial throne,
Allowing me to take over the world!
[Squeak] [plop] Uhh! Ooh!
They're right in here with all the fun, fun games
I brought to play with in the waiting room. Zort!
[Gasps] Oh, look.
I've got jacks and wind-Up toys
No! Don't leave me!
Well, what about all this stuff? Boring. Been there, done that.
Well, make small talk with that man over there
And give me my mirrored glasses.
Um...hi. Let's see. Um... do you know anything about lilliputians?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to make small talk. Ach, don't trouble yourself.
I'm just a sad little sad man. Life brings me nothing but dreary sadness.
I'm sad all the time. Boy, am i sad.
Well, i brought a pair of googly-Eye glasses. They'll cheer you up.
Oogedy-Boogedy! Ha ha ha ha ha! Narf!
But all i see is my own dreary, sad little sad face.
Poit.
These aren't my googly-Eye glasses.
These are mirrored gla-- [Gasps]
Uh-Oh. You are getting sleepy... very sleepy.
No, no. You are getting sleepy.
[Boing] Hey, take off those ridiculous glasses.
Huh? Now, where were we? Ah, yes.
You are getting sleepy. Wait.
Pinky has my other glasses. I--I need them.
You don't need glasses to be hypnotized. Oh, yes. Really, i...
Have...to...get... them. I...
Yes.
Let yourself go.
Must remember to... hurt pinky at first opportunity.
No.
You don't want to hurt anybody. We are going to discover who hurt you. We are going back to your childhood.
Going back... back.
You are in a deep sleep, ja?
Ja.
I mean... yes. I want you to think about a time When you were very young.
Freud: where you are, brain? Brain:
in a field, playing. How old are you? Just a child,
Not a care in the world.
[Grunts]
[Snap] [Clatter]
[Grunts]
Suddenly i'm being chased,
Hunted down like some sort of rabid dog.
Terrified, i run home to my parents.
They rush to my aid, But my assailant is overpowering. I was taken from my home
And sent to a research facility.
As i entered those doors, The carefree innocence of my youth
Was snuffed out like a candle,
Replaced with unremitting darkness. Lab-Coated goons tried to break our spirits And brainwash us into submission.
Others emerged from the experience... not quite all there.
Narf! Zort! Hee hee hee hee!
The slightest insolence resulted in punishment Both swift and brutal.
[Mice gasp] More? You want more?
Aah.
Aah!
I never met a man i didn't meet.
Aah!
The problem with congress is... they're all liars.
Aah! Make it stop!
And how did that make you feel?
Angry... like i wanted to... to take over the world.
It's... a tin can.
There's something on the side of it, a... a picture.
No. No. I--I mean, i--I can't tell.
It's a picture of... of... the world! And then they dragged me away. And you want your world back.
It's simple. Yes. [Snap] what?
Where am i? Your problem is simple, herr brain. You just want to go home.
"how to hypnotize anyone.
Create a relaxing atmosphere."
Okey-Dokey, you sick little puppy. Move it. I got another client.
Oh, there's not enough time for this.
[Smack] oh!
Oh, no. What have i done?
Oh, no. What have i done? Yes!
You'll obey my every command. I will obey.
Is nothing but cheap nostalgia.
Maybe all i'm really longing for is... is... a rusty tin can.
What a quack. Ha ha ha ha ha! Narf!
Oh, very good, mr. Elephant. Zort!
Ach, herr pinky, i'm having the most exciting fun
For the first time in my dreary, sad life. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
Narf! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
I will hypnotize the emperor franz josef And order him to make brain his successor.
Perfect. When i snap my fingers, you will awaken.
[Snap]
Ach!
Herr brain, it's late.
You made good progress today.
More than you know, doctor.
Oh, come over any time, herr pinky.
Here is meine card.
Auf wiedersehen. Gesundheit! Who's your new friend, pinky?
"His most imperial emperor franz josef"?
Pinky, that's the man i wanted freud to hypnotize.
Oh, he doesn't want to be hypnotized now, brain.
Since i taught him all my favorite games, He says he'll never need therapy again.
I believe i need therapy, pinky, To find out why i hang around with a nut like you.
Come. We must go back to the lab
And prepare for tomorrow night. Why, brain? What are we going to do tomorrow night?
Try to shrink your head? No, pinky,
The same thing we do every night, No matter how forcefully the purveyors of psychobabble
Attempt to dissuade us-- Try to take over the world!
♪ they're dinky ♪ ♪ they're pinky and the brain ♪
♪ brain, brain, brain, brain ♪
Assuming a standard height-To-Weight ratio
And a 3-Point margin of error... pinky: ha ha ha ha!
[Synthetic laughter] Factor in g-Force and wind shear
Of each downward thrust... ha ha ha ha!
[Synthetic laughter] That does it!
Pinky, what are you doing? Ha ha ha! Oh, poit!
I'm playing With my new "tickle me herbert" doll, brain. You just tickle him here,
And he laughs and laughs. Kootchie kootchie kootchie! [Synthetic laughter]
Well, put it away.
I can hardly hear myself think.
Maybe you're just not thinking loud enough, brain. Pinky, may i see that for a moment?
Sure--Uhh!
[Synthetic laughter] [Laughter fades]
Oh, brain, i think he likes you.
Zort!
Now maybe i'll have the quiet i need
To finish perfecting my latest plan.
You might say we're going fishing.
And all the stuff you need for keeping bees.
That's not fishing. Ha!
Oh, that's skiing. Try to focus, pinky.
This is the finnious japonicus,
Commonly known in japan as mugu.
One bite of its tail renders anyone who eats it
Unable to move for 24 hours.
I had a linoleum sandwich last week That made me feel the same way, But shiny.
And place it over your mouth. [Muffled] ok.
My plan is simply this--
I will capture a pair of mugu, breed them, And market the tails throughout the world As cappy brain's frozen fish sticks.
While the populace is immobilized,
I shall implement my plan of world domination. There's only one catch.
Oh?
Well, that won't be enough To feed the whole world, then, will it?
[Muffled] sorry. The japonicus is so rare
That the only known specimens
Are those bred in captivity For the dining pleasure of japan's most elite sumo wrestlers.
[Muffled question]
If you're going to speak, pinky. Oh.
[Muffled question] I have anticipated your query, pinky.
I plan to become One of japan's most elite sumo wrestlers. Observe.
Narf!
[Gasps] The "tickle me dom deluise"?
Oh, why, that's the most expensive one.
Look closer, pinky.
To fit the precise specifications
Of a champion sumo wrestler.
With the adjustments i've made,
I'll be able to flip a 600-Pound man.
Won't you need an awfully large spatula for that?
Don't forget to pack your doll
When we go to japan, pinky.
I might feel the need
Noogie. Give him the noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie. Unh!
Good work, tomu-San. Tomorrow we work on the wedgie. Now go.
Brain: master hama? Yes?
Allow me to introduce myself. I am the brain.
I have come many miles with my small valet pinky
To study sumo at the camp of master hama.
Your head is as small as a lychee nut,
But your physique is excellent for sumo.
I would be honored to teach you.
Actually, i am but an insignificant lab mouse
Attempting to take over the world. The honor is all mine. [Clank]
Whaa! Whoa! [Crash]
There is no need for false humility And groveling. Come.
We begin immediately. Let us begin our first lesson.
Excellent.
Who do i flip first? Patience, brain-San.
When you are more advanced.
Today, we consider the pebble.
Consider the pebble?
Zen exercise to increase concentration.
Observe the pebble's simplicity. Listen to its silence.
Become the pebble. You want me to stare at a rock all day?
Just until lunchtime.
See you in 4 hours.
Hama thinks i'm a beginner, pinky. Until he lets me compete
With advanced wrestlers, I'll never get access to the mugu.
Pinky?
I was becoming one with the pebble.
Were you? Yes.
And it's really easy.
All you have to do is make your mind a complete blank.
Too bad drawing a blank isn't an olympic event, pinky.
We could retire on the gold medals you'd win.
Eat well, brain-San. We have much training left to do.
Aren't you hungry, master hama? No.
I eat big lunch with my star wrestlers In other dining hall--
Fried mugu, cajun mugu, mugu chowder, mojo mugu.
Perhaps you will be allowed to eat mugu, too, eh?
Sooner than you think, my pan-Pacific friend.
The sumo men must eat a lot to get so fat.
Wrestlers not fat, pinky-San. It is muscle tissue
Resulting from years of strenuous yoga exercises. [Door opens] Who wants pie?
Pinky, a day has passed, And we have nothing to show for it.
Oh, i don't know, brain. I've developed a lovely relationship With our new friend the pebble.
Pinky, have you ever contemplated the sound of one hand bopping?
One hand, um... don't think so.
Aah! [Crowd chattering in distance]
What's going on?
It is matsuhisa, the best wrestler in camp. He has had too much pie
And is taking on all challengers. Grrr! Pinky: egad, brain.
To beat that matsu hoozy fellow.
Pinky, are you pondering what i'm pondering?
I think so, brain,
But who wants to see Snow white and the seven samurai?
No, pinky.
I will defeat the great matsuhisa, Thereby proving That i am a great sumo wrestler.
Matsuhisa, i will accept your challenge. What's going on here?
Brain-San has gone completely insane. Hmm, oh, that would explain
[Grunting]
Oof! Quit now, brain-San.
Better to be live coward than dead idiot.
Don't worry, hama. It's a matter of scientific fact
That i can flip any man up to 600 pounds. Matsuhisa weighs 601 pounds.
Noogie, noogie, noogie. Ow!
Stop hurting brain, you, you pie wrecker!
[Grunts] whoa!
[Crash]
[Boing]
Whaa!
[Grunts]
Kootchie kootchie.
[Laughing] Kootchie kootchie kootchie.
Poit. Kootchie kootchie koo. Zort!
Kootchie koo. Kootchie poit!
[Crowd gasps]
Whaa ha ha ha! Whoa ho ho ho!
Whoa! Whoa! Oof!
[Cheering] The winner! Narf!
Pinky: ooh, now we can get into the fancy restaurant, brain.
And we'll get ahold of the fancy fish. This way, pinky.
This is it, pinky. The world's only specimens of finnious japonicus
You put the yum in yum-Yum-Yummy, cappy brain. Zort!
[Both grunt] Tell me if you see any movement, pinky.
Pinky: um, think i saw some movement just then, brain.
Perhaps i should have researched the size of the mugu
A bit more thoroughly.
What do we do now, cappy brain? Hope the chef pushes the mugu, pinky,
And plan for tomorrow night. Why?
What are we going to do tomorrow night, brain? Same thing we do every night, pinky--
Dry off, and then
Try to take over the world.

NEEK. YOUR HAT.
BEHOLD THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR CONQUEST.
EGAD!
AN AMUSEMENT PARK FOR FLEAS.
IT'S THE MINIATURE PROTOTYPE FOR MY GREATEST STROKE OF GENIUS, PINKY.
THE FEDOR-A-MATIC.
OBSERVE.
WE SHALL DIVERT THE FLOW OF THE LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY TO A GIGANTIC VERSION OF THIS MOCK-UP.
OOH, A WATER PARK!
WILL IT HAVE SLIPPERY SLIDES AND BUMPER BOATS?
WILL IT, BRAIN? HUH?
LOOK CLOSER AND SEE, PINKY.
YES, THE FEDOR-A-MATIC WORKS LIKE A DREAM!
I'LL SAY.
I FEEL ALL TINGLY IN A GOOD WAY.
OH! YOU WOULD.
BUT THE MORE LIKELY REACTION WILL BE PANIC AND UTTER CHAOS.
WITH THE POPULACE TRAPPED IN THEIR HATS, WE SHALL SEIZE LOS ANGELES AND THEN...

OH, BUT NO, NO, WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T WEAR HATS?
THERE ARE NO PEOPLE WHO DON'T WEAR HATS.
IT'S 1946.
EVERYONE WEARS HATS ALL THE TIME.
NOW, COME, PINKY.
WE MUST TRAVEL TO CITY HALL AND OBTAIN THE WATER RIGHTS FOR THE FEDOR-A-MATIC FROM THE COUNCIL.
HOW, BRAIN?
ARE WE GOING TO BRIBE THEM WITH CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT SECRET DECODER RINGS?
DON'T BE TOO SURE I'M AS CROOKED AS I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.

YOU DIRTY... HAMSTER!
LET BILLIE GO OR I'LL--
HEADS.
TOUGH LUCK, BRAIN.
MAYBE YOU CAN TRY FOR 2 OUT OF 3.
BRAIN, BRAIN, BRAIN.
YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW THAT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES WE PLAY THE GAME, I ALWAYS WIN.
WELL, I'LL GIVE MY REGARDS TO BILLIE FOR YOU.
TOODLE-OO, OLD CHUMP.
G'BYE, SNOWBALL.
BE SURE TO CALL AGAIN SOON!
DON'T BE SHY! DROP BY ANY TI--AAH!
TO COIN A PHRASE... OUCH.
Brain: BILLIE NEEDED ME,
SO, PUTTING MY PLANS FOR WORLD DOMINATION ON HIATUS, WE HASTENED TO THE PALATIAL ABODE OF MY NEMESIS.
Pinky: YOU MEAN WE HOT-FOOTED IT TO THE HAMSTER'S JOINT?
Brain: CLAM UP, PINKY.
THE HAMSTER LIVED IN ONE OF THOSE $30,000 SPANISH-STYLE MEDIEVAL CASTLES THAT EVERYONE WAS SO NUTS ABOUT A FEW YEARS BACK.
NOW, KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED FOR CLUES.
DO THEY MAKE A SPECIAL UTENSIL FOR THAT, BRAIN?
NO, PINKY, BUT I BELIEVE THEY DO MAKE A MOUTH CLAMP.
WHY DON'T YOU USE IT?
IT'S BILLIE, PINKY!
WE MUST MAKE HASTE!
YOU MEAN, "GET THE LARD OUT, CHUMP"? WHAA!
Brain: IT CAN'T BE!
PINKY, THE HAMSTER HAS PURLOINED OUR DESIGNS FOR THE FEDOR-A-MATIC.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? OOOH!
I'LL GET ANOTHER TIGHT, TINGLY HAT?
NO, PINKY.
A SLIGHTLY SNUG SOMBRERO?
MILDLY UNCOMFORTABLE LEDERHOSEN?
NOT ONLY HAS THE HAMSTER STOLEN BILLIE, HE WANTS TO STEAL THE WORLD!
[GRUNTING] PINKY... HELP!
MY HAT IS STUCK.
ALWAYS THE LUCKY ONE, AREN'T YOU?
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HAT?
AHH! LOOK, BRAIN!
A WHOLE GAGGLE OF HATS.
PINKY, WHERE ARE YOU?
THIS ONE'S RATHER RAKISH. HOO HOO.
BRAIN? WHERE ARE YOU?
HOW DO I MAKE IT TIGHT?
OH, THE IRONY OF IT ALL.
HOISTED BY MY OWN FEDOR-A-MATIC.
BRAIN! THE WORLD!
THE WORLD CAN WAI--OOF!
THERE YOU ARE, BRAIN.
BAD FOR GLASS! BAD FOR GLASS!
BAD FOR BRAIN.
ALL MY SUFFERING WAS FOR NAUGHT, PINKY.
WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE CLUE TO FOLLOW.
DOES THAT MEAN THIS GROCERY LIST I FOUND IN MY HAT ISN'T A CLUE?
"THINGS TO DO."
[READING]
"BRIBE CITY COUNCIL"?
-TYPE THEME] Pinky: THIS IS THE CITY-- UM...
I MEAN, THIS IS THE CITY HALL!
BUT YOU CAN'T SELL OFF THE WATER RIGHTS.
I NEED WATER FOR MY ARUGULA!
AND I NEED WATER FOR MY KOMBUCHA MUSHROOM PLANTATION.
I NEED WATER FOR MY MR. WIGGLY-WOGGLY HOSEY THINGY DINGY DERE!
SORRY, BUT THE WATER RIGHTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN AWARDED.
MEETING IS ADJOURNED.
JIMINY! I ALWAYS WANTED A CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT DECODER RING!
I'LL SAY! THIS IS SWELL!
PINKY, ARE YOU PONDERING WHAT I'M PONDERING?
I THINK SO, BRAIN, BUT IF WE GET SAM SPAYED,
WE'LL NEVER HAVE ANY PUPPIES.
SOMEONE HAS ALREADY BRIBED THE COUNCIL FOR THE WATER RIGHTS.
YOU MEAN...
DON'T SAY IT, PINKY.
WEE WILLIE WINKIE?
Snowball:
TOO LATE AGAIN, BRAIN.
PPPBBBBLLTTT!
AFTER HIM, PINKY!
I NEED WATER FOR MY ELEPHANTS! OW!
WE'RE IN LUCK!
TAX--EEEGH!
FOLLOW THAT CAR!
YES! THIS IS A PAIN THAT IS MOST PROMISING.
EGAD! IT'S ASTOUNDING, BRAIN.
THAT I AM PLIANT ENOUGH TO SURVIVE SUCH CALAMITY?
NOOO! THAT YOU ACTUALLY FOUND A CAB IN L.A. NATCH!
Brain:
WE GOT TO THE RESERVOIR WITHOUT A MOMENT TO LOSE. Pinky:
AND THERE WERE 3 BOWLS OF PORRIDGE.
AND I SAID, "MY, GRANDMA.
WHAT BIG, SWOLLEN ANKLES YOU HAVE."
Brain: STOW IT, PINKY.
COME ON, PINKY.
IT'S NOT AS HARD AS IT LOOKS. ARGH!
YOU JUST GET A LITTLE-- [RIPPING] YAAH! SCRAPED UP, THAT'S-- [RIPPING]
PINKY!
PINKY, HURRY UP!
RIGHT HERE, BRAIN. NATCH!
OH, WELL, SURE!
YOU CAN TAKE THE EASY WAY!
Man with Polish accent: HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, MOUSEY MOUSE.
YOU'RE A VERY NOSY FELLA, MOUSEY MOUSE.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO NOSY FELLAS, HMM?
HUH? DO YOU? HMM?
THIS!
GEE, I NEVER THINK TO CARRY AN UMBRELLA IN LOS ANGELES. GAAAH!
EGAD!
I'LL SAVE YOU, BRAIN!
UM, BRAIN, BEFORE I SAVE YOU, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TEACH ME TO SWIM?
WITH ALL THAT AIR IN YOUR HEAD, IT'S A WONDER YOU DON'T FLOAT.
WHOO-HOO! THAT WAS ALMOST AS THRILLING AS OUR SWIRLING WHIRLPOOL OF FUN
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING IN THE TOILET AGAIN, HAVEN'T YOU, PINKY?
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO GET TECHNICAL...
NO! IT CAN'T BE!
PINKY, WE'RE TOO LATE.
THE FEDOR-A-MATIC HAS BEEN BUILT!
OOH, JOY!
TIGHT HAT CITY, HERE WE COME!
TOP OF THE WORLD, BRAIN.
CARE TO TIP YOUR HAT TO MY ACCOMPLISHMENT WHILE YOU STILL CAN? HA HA HA HA HA!
AFTER HIM, PINKY.
HE'S ABOUT TO ENGAGE THE MACHINE.
POIT! I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE GOING STEADY.
WE REALLY OUGHT TO BRING A GIFT, BRAIN--HWACK!
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE REGISTERED?
CONGRATULATIONS, SNOWBALL!
WE'RE SO HAPPY FOR YOU AND YOUR FIANCEE!
A HAMSTER ENGAGED TO A BIG MACHINE?
WHAT WILL PEOPLE SAY?
Brain: STOP BEING FOOLISH, PINKY.
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT, BRAIN.
AS LONG AS THEY'RE HAPPY.
WE SHOULD GET THEM SOMETHING NICE.
A FONDUE SET, MAYBE. I MEAN, AFTER ALL, WE ARE GETTING TIGHT HATS IN THE BARGAIN.
I'LL STOP YOU NOW.
IT CAN'T BE!
EGAD, BRAIN!
SNOWBALL'S TURNED INTO A MOUSE!
NO, PINKY. IT'S BILLIE.
BILLIE'S TURNED INTO A HAMSTER?
NYEH! SHE'S A MOUSE!
SHE'S A HAMSTER!
SHE'S A MOUSE!
SHE'S A MOUSE AND A HAMSTER? [SOBBING]
YES, EGGIE, IT IS I.
BUT... BUT WHY?
Snowball: BECAUSE SHE LOVES ME.
YES, BRAIN, IT WAS ALL A RUSE,
DESIGNED TO DISTRACT YOU LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO STEAL YOUR PLANS AND EXECUTE THEM.
AND EXECUTE ME IN THE PROCESS.
DON'T BE SILLY, BRAIN.
IT WOULD TAKE ALL THE FUN OUT OF LIFE.
I DERIVE MY GREATEST PLEASURE FROM MAKING YOU SQUIRM.
I DERIVE MY GREATEST PLEASURE FROM MAKING BRAIN SQUIRT MILK OUT OF HIS NOSE. NATCH!
HA HA HA HA! Billie: STOP THAT!
SNOWBALL WASN'T TRYING TO GET RID OF YOU, EGGHEAD. I WAS!
I'M SORRY, EGGIE, BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE, I'LL NEVER REALLY HAVE THE THING I WANT MOST.
THE WORLD?
ME.
GUESS AGAIN.
PUT ME DOWN, YOU GOON.
SORRY, SNOWY.
I WAS JUST USING YOU TO GET THE WATER RIGHTS.
BESIDES, YOU NEVER COULD ACCEPT ME FOR WHAT I AM, MAKING ME TAKE VOICE LESSONS AND ALL.
AND YOU, EGGIE, YOU LOVE THE WORLD TOO MUCH TO EVER REALLY CARE ABOUT ME.
SORRY, BUT NEITHER OF YOU WILL EVER HOLD A CANDLE TO MY ONE TRUE LOVE.
PINKY...
PINKY? !
PINKY? ! I'VE BEEN PLAYED LIKE A TUNELESS FIDDLE AT A HOEDOWN.
CARE TO DO THE HOKEY-POKEY?
PINKY, I BUILT THIS FOR YOU.
I HOPE YA LIKE IT.
EGAD! MY OWN FEDOR-A-MATIC?
NO, MY DARLING!
A GIANT WATER PARK! WITH SLIPPERY SLIDES AND BUMPER BOATS!
OOOH, BRAIN! CAN WE RIDE THE BUMPER BOATS?
CAN WE?
CAN WE, PLEE-EE-EE-EASE?
YOU DON'T NEED BRAIN'S PERMISSION, PINKY.
I DON'T? NO!
YOUR DAYS OF BEING BOPPED ON THE HEAD
AND KOWTOWING TO BRAIN'S EVERY WHIM ARE OVER!
THEY ARE? YES!
BOYS?
GEE, THAT LOOKS LIKE KICKS, GOONY-GOON.
ALONE AT LAST!
HA HA HA HA! OH, YOU'RE NOT ALONE, BILLIE.
I'M HERE!
AND NOW I CAN GIVE YOU THE GREATEST GIFT OF ALL.
A HAT SQUISHED DOWN ALL TINGLY-WINGLY AROUND MY HEAD?
NO, SILLY!
WELL... WHAT DO YA THINK?
YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER MY WORLD, BIG BOY?
UM, ER, UH, UH,
I--I--I--I--I-- I'LL HAVE TO ASK BRAIN IF IT'S OK.
HE WAS SOME KIND OF A MOUSE.
HEY, DAD, WHAT'S THAT?
THE WORLD'S FIRST WATER PARK.
IT SURE LOOKS SWELL.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
Brain, voice-over: WELL, THIS IS WHERE YOU CAME IN-- WITH ME IN THE DRINK LIKE SOMEBODY'S DIRTY LAUNDRY.
Pinky, voice-over: OOH! I HOPE THEY SEPARATED THE UNDERGARMENTS.
COME, PINKY.
WE MUST TOWEL OFF AND PREPARE FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.
GEE, BRAIN, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TOMORROW NIGHT,
CONSTRUCT A MACHINE TO MAKE OUR PANTS REALLY TIGHT?
THE SAME THING WE DO EVERY NIGHT--
TRY TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!
Snowball: IF I DON'T BEAT YOU TO IT.
GET YOUR HAND OFF OF ME, YOU DAMP, HAIRY HAMSTER!
* THEY'RE DINKY, THEY'RE PINKY *
* AND THE BRAIN, BRAIN, BRAIN, BRAIN, BRAIN *
- Step right up Ladies and gentlemen!
- There's no TV
people need entertainment
- A gala?
- A gala
- A gala
- "Death Hammer"
- Put everything exactly back where you got it
If he notices anything, we're done for
- CorbeiI, we have a problem
- help me!
tell me who killed you, who killed Dr What's going on with the TV
- What we've been seeing on TV, logically, must have come from the mind of blanche Von Trieck
- Except that she's dead
- You must have some idea?
Those guys are scattered all over the world
Except LefIaguais who's dead
A signal
- LefIaguais
- We'II locate the transmitter
- What?
The TV again?
- Goddamnit
- Biron!
Nobody knows you searched the safe If you've put everything back, it's all good
- Yeah, yeah
- The old woman appeared to me when I was in the ring
She gave me another clue:
"The last victim will act as a compass"
- That's all fine and dandy Lapointe but I've got documents in the car
- Did you read them?
- No, I'm going to right now
- Shit, Biron!
Do you have a record?
- A criminal record? - Why?
- Fingerprints!
- Never mind
- I didn't know a little "home-made" alcohol in the bottles would make them sick
If they didn't drink so much in the first place
Now two of them have stomach cancer but it's not my fault
- hold on Buddy:
I think some of them have two words for you - Come on guys, you know me better than that
I never did that
well, well, look who we have here
- I didn't want to lose custody of the kid
I'm the one who put the naked children's photos in his things
I just wanted
- That's enough
- Go back home
I'II talk to you tomorrow
Let's meet again, same place
- Same time
- No, Iet's say noon
- Sarah, go back to bed
Armand!
Go away, you're drunk
- I'm not drunk
- You've already woken up Sarah
- I'm leaving tomorrow
I've come to say goodbye
- I'm leaving too
- You're leaving?
- I've lost everyone I Ioved in Great Bear - Not me;
I'm still here and
Stephanie I'm drunk
Take me with you
- Go away
You're hurting me
Again - people change Stephanie
I've changed and I'II change again, OK?
And what the old woman said isn't true
I didn't betray you by working with your father
I betrayed myself
For you
- I need a straighter and stronger man than that
- You can't do that
Stephanie, open the door
You want to know something?
Do you?
Open up and I'II tell you who killed your mother
Who and why and how
- What? You knew?
- well
- You knew?
- well
I don't want to hear it!
- What's going on?
- Stephanie,
Sarah can show you what you want to know
- Go ahead, Stephanie
- Christian
Where are we going?
- It's gonna hurt at first but it's about time someone opened your eyes about Dad and your sister
It's almost over Mom
That big dumb-ass
- This isn't right, it isn't right
- Who fired?
- Who's with you?
- I'm with Mom
- Suzanne!
- almost over almost over
- I'd take money in my register every time
I was doing my job
- Everything's in its place
Wait
BeIiveau, the copier is warm
- Shit! I'II be right there
- "The last victim will act as a compass
- congratulations
- Thanks
I'm sorry about what happened to blanche and your wife
- blanche said you'd come and talk to me about this
- I thought blanche's stories
- Some days I manage not to believe them
- Want some?
- You lost your wife too, eh?
- Yeah
- So, what was it you wanted to tell me?
- I don't really know
I thought maybe you could help me with my investigation or to understand why blanche chose me, why I'm here
- Look, BIanche would probably tell you that the answer is right before your eyes
As far as compass goes, doesn't get any better
- I had to come
- That's OK, I'm glad you're here
- I'm sorry about this afternoon
- I don't want you to explain, Catherine
You asked me before if I believe it's possible to start over
well now, with you, I think I couId
- The whole town is blabbing on TV
One scandal after another
They take turns beating on each other
Nothing very interesting
- Hey, Moron
That's you on TV
- We're real good friends
- I'm exhausted
- Why don't I escort you to your bed?
- No, with you, I forget everything;
I don't feel as tired
- I didn't say we'd sleep
- Not my place, not now
- It's "Badaboom" Mrs
Badaboom was more than his dog
I
I didn't see him
I ran him over
- Badaboom?
That was you, Moron?
- Yes
- Badaboom?
But why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't, I felt so bad
- Come here
Forget about it
Badaboom would have wanted it that way
- Yeah, OK
- Those documents don't exist anymore, eh, BeIiveau?
- I kept them - I know why you kept them Because you're afraid of me
A real female
I misjudged you
I'm willing to bet that journalist had something to do with this
- Lapointe?
No, he - Not Lapointe
Biron Lapointe wouldn't have left prints all over the place
Check if they match Biron's file and we have to find him right now
Send someone to the hydroplanes
There's only one road leading out of Great Bear, right?
- olson Road to the forty-four About a hundred miles in the woods
- I'II put up a roadblock
If this gets out, do you realize how much shit we'II be in because of you?
They'II be looking for a scapegoat and I'm not going down alone,
- Yes Sir
I'II be there as soon as I can
Yes
If I'm there tomorrow, I'II be on Lapointe's TV show
This is big Simone, bigger than the Lambert case;
- It's your turn EmiIe
What the Lambert case did for Lapointe's career, this scoop will do for yours, Honey
- But
Lapointe; do you really think
- You think he would have shared the spotlight on a case like this?
- Don't rely on appearances
Lapointe is a bit harsh sometimes but deep down he's a good guy
- emile, without that scoop, his career is over
- That's why it wouId be a rotten thing to
- He might be a good guy but he'II take all the credit because he can't afford not to
Don't you get it?
They sent him to Great Bear to get rid of him, he said so himself
- I don't know
- emile
You're just a pawn to him
What do you think's gonna happen if you show up there together?
It'II be: "hello Lapointe!
Leave your shadow in the coatroom"
- Hey
I led the investigation into the Iumberjacks
That's my doing
- That's all I'm saying, Kitten
It's your turn
- It's about time I got out of here
- Biron
Biron?
He probably thought this would be the first place the cops would come looking for him
The key is at the front desk
- Coast is clear, they're gone
- You're booking me?
- Hurry up, he can't be far
- What's the motive?
- We'II deal with it at the station
- They must have the hydroplanes under surveillance
I can't take the road
- I have an idea
- Did you find him? - No
- I want my lawyer!
- Miss, I apologize for the brief delay, but be assured that
I want my lawyer!
- What lawyer?
- hello What?
- Did you see what's on TV?
- I don't watch TV anymore
- I'm sure it wouId cheer you up
- There's only one thing that would cheer me up
- Does this make my ass look fat?
- hello?
Hi Gastonne, how are you doing?
- How am "I" doing?
well
We emptied the place and filled up the hospital
Where are you?
- Somewhere safe
- What did you find?
Is my father involved?
Be honest
- No
- I mean I didn't find anything compromising on anybody
I don't think I took the right documents
- It's still breaking and entering
- I can't talk to you
The cops are here
- OK, don't move EmiIe
- I can't do this
- Come on EmiIe, it'II grow back
- But my pride won't
- What does that mean?
- Look at me
I just lied to my best friend
I'm betraying Lapointe I'm lying to my childhood idol for God's sake!
- emile, don't start this again
- I won't start again
I swear I won't start again
- Kitten
- HeIène
We found him
- My husband?
- He's in the hospital
Get dressed, I'II
Biron
This is Georges Ferron!
Hurry up and find him a room He paid for this hospital
- It's all right Christian
It wasn't a heart attack, just a little warning
- A heart attack?
You told me
- It's nothing; she just told you
- But Dad
- Make a man of yourself!
- Yeah, yeah
- How's our business going?
- Dove will be here this morning, with the money
She's already taken a liking to me
We'II do it in broad daylight
She'II be a friend of mine visiting
We make the trade, no hassle;
she sleeps at the hotel, no worries
- Did you think of that yourself?
- Sure did!
I even arranged a surprise reunion with an old friend of hers
- What did I tell you about Armand?
He's not worth
- Not worth it?
Armand's share is twenty thousand bucks!
- What do you do if she shoots him in the middle of the street?
- No, she doesn't suspect a thing
Got her wrapped around my little finger
Guaranteed
Armand!
Open up
hold me
- How's it going?
We can do this another day if you want; I'm in no hurry
- If you made me come over here to see me abandoned and miserable; go ahead, take a good look
- No is an unexpected pleasure
- What are you doing here if you haven't done anything?
- You have no scruples getting murderers off, but the innocent
- If you have to whip me some more
I told you, I'm sorry about your wife, and I regret getting the guy off
- AII right, all right
- I forgive you
- You say that because the bars keep you from strangling me?
I'm not doing it for you;
If you only knew how much better I feel, not hating you
- I can believe that
OK
- actually, they don't want me; it's Biron they're after
- Biron?
Why?
- They think he's got compromising documents
- Compromising for who?
- For national Security Why, I don't know yet but it has to do with the helicopter accident that killed the Iumberjacks ten years ago
- That ugly statue in front?
- Yeah, that's it In fact, they have no intentions of letting me go until they have Biron and the documents
- OK, so what am I doing here?
- You play along but
while they were interrogating me, I overheard some info:
listen At ten o'cIock sharp
- WouIdn't it be better to tell them to send backup?
In eight seconds
special Agent CorbeiI, colonel
Edouard Paquette and Robert BeIiveau are also present
I'm fully aware this is a delicate case, but I have the situation under control
Paquette and BeIiveau can testify to it
- Yes
He succeeded in reproducing and improving the technology developed by Paquette
He was able to make a copy of his victim's brain
AvirtuaI copy
- A copy of her brain - That's what they said but I don't have all the details
- glad to run into you
- I have to be somewhere but I'II be back later
But I'm warning you Biron;
I'm leaving Great Bear tomorrow
- Come on Armand
Lapointe - Lapointe, follow the constable: you're free to go
- Come on Lapointe
- Don't worry Biron, we'II get you out of here
- well, I sure hope so!
Gastonne, Gastonne you can't leave me here
- That's not so bad, all they have on you is driving under the influence
You'II end up with three months and community service, maximum
- No, Gastonne I lied to you
I did read the documents
They'II want to kill me, I swear!
They already have killed a dozen others;
- What were those papers?
- Your friend Biron didn't tell you?
- He didn't read them
Anyway, I want to hear it from you
What happened to the Iumberjacks?
Of course: you never trusted me
You're not about to start today
- You want me to trust you but - Yes
- Can you keep a secret?
It wasn't supposed to be that way
They asked me for twelve guys, preferably unemployed, with no wives, no kids
- No future
- I ran an ad:
"Dangerous job, lots of quick money"
I knew exactly who would show up
Before they got on the helicopter,
CorbeiI offered them five times their pay if they agreed to participate in an experiment
They all signed up
Sam first
After a few days, I went up to see what was going on
The guys had lost their minds
When I got a hold of Sam
Come on!
Come on Sam!
Sam, Sam, listen Listen Sam
You have to get out of here while you still got cells!
- still got cells
- Go on!
Then they arranged for the accident
- And you didn't say anything
- No!
Are you insane?
You have to help me Gastonne
Do this for your father
If all this gets out
- "still got cells";
that's the sentence which got us started on the right track
- Yes, I know
I liked Sam
You see where feelings get you?
You always say I have a heart of stone
But I got Sam out; that proves
please, don't make me regret the only time I followed my heart
- You already regret it
You can't turn your father in
help me
You're a cop Dad
You're supposed to protect people
- You're the only person I can count on
- You say I'm not a good cop
Take a look at yourself
- They'II lock me up for the rest of my Iife For a mistake that, even if I wanted to, I can't fix
- I'II think about it
Listen and the bar are yours but
- relax Dove
I have a surprise you're gonna like
- There you are!
Give me my money and then: adios
Dove?
- hello Armand
- Christian
- Give me my bag - Do what you want with him, but not here, OK?
- I said give me my bag, now!
Armand!
We can finally settle this
- please
- Here
This is all I wrote you since
half are love letters, half are death threats:
they're for you
- Because it took a Iong time but
I want nothing to do with you
Nothing with your love, nothing with your death
They're yours
- You knew I was here?
- You're the only one who called me Dove
- Dove, you know
- Kiss me
Kiss me one last time, then Goodbye
- Goodbye
- Stef, put that down
- Who is she?
- This is Dove: my ex
- That's right, I am his ex
- I'm sure it's true
Funny how easy it is to get the truth when you're holding this eh?
Funny
I should have tried this before eh?
I would have known a Iot faster that you led Mom to her death
- Who told you
You know I didn't want to hurt her
I just wanted her to know
- Don't swear in front of me
- I would have told you but Dad
- What you told me was that you don't ever want me to try to help you
Count on me
I don't think there's anything left for me to know, right?
unless there's something else you're hiding, eh Armand?
- careful
- I wasn't talking to you
She seems to know what she's talking about eh?
Is that what excites you?
A chick with a gun?
Am I turning you on, Armand?
- Stef
- What are you waiting for?
Don't you see she's crazy about you?
- Not loaded?
You know, I really do like you
- So, are you going to show me your big - That's right, I am his ex.
- Here, didn't you ordered this?
- I haven't felt like this in so long
I mean, I'm with you but
- Goes back a Iong way
- Yeah AII this time, I thought the clues from blanche were leading me to a criminal
When in reality, they were leading me to you
Doesn't matter
- Yes
- blanche's killer it's Catherine
Lapointe?
It's Catherine! It's Catherine
- Avery bad cycle has begun
- Here
I don't know the meaning of these sentences but I know they will help you, one by one, to save my soul
- Georges, your son is completely stoned
- I have a feeling we'II get along, you and I, Christian
- There's no doubt
The waves producing the images on TV are of identical nature to the ones I was obtaining with my device, ten years ago
- I did things I would never do with him
I just want him back, BIanche
- HeIène, HeIène
- Who could be doing that?
AII of my ex-coIIaborators have been contacted, it's beyond me
- Don't you find that strange?
A neurologist to fix a TV signal problem?
- If there's a link between the two stories, we have a hell of a scoop
The only concrete facts we have are the article about Edouard Paquette found in Doctor Mondoux's hand and the missing file on the Iumberjacks
- If the documents aren't there, he decided it
- We have to open BeIiveau's safe
- The problem is that he's the only one who has the key
And he always keeps it on him
- You wanted Louis-Bernard Lapointe for your gala?
You shall have him
- Out of the question!
- Marcoux
tell Gastonne that Marcoux
She has to find Marcoux
tell Biron that blanche's book is not blanche's book
Did you look? - No
- tell me
- No
- You'II pay for this
- Maryse!
- You looked? - Maryse!
- Why did you look?
You'II pay for this
- Maryse! - You looked!
You looked!
- Pierre! Pierre!
hold him
Attention everyone!
Don't miss tonight, the first ever Super gala of Great Bear
- Hand me that microphone
A one of a kind boxing Iine-up featuring the one and only "Death Hammer"
- Jean-Guy Poitras
You'II get fights, special attractions and the participation of a surprise celebrity
Attention everyone!
Don't miss tonight, the first ever Super gala of Great Bear
- HeIène Marcoux?
special Agent CorbeiI
- Dear God, have you found my husband?
- please follow me
- And then I run, I jump in my car and I drive with the pedal to the metal
- Biron
- Wait, wait, wait!
And then, I come back just in time
What do you think Louis?
- Since when are we on first-name basis?
- well, since yesterday I think
- Wait a minute
OK;
I had warned you but you didn't listen to me
- well
- Yeah, OK; I saw her again
- Simone, the radio host
- Yes, Simone
She apologized; she realized that she had under-estimated me
- Yeah, I didn't doubt it for a second
- well I don't blame her Even I under-estimate myself
- Less and less I'd say
What's worse is that you slept with her
- How do you know that Louis?
- How do you know that sir?
- How do you know that?
And so what?
- Come on, take a good look at yourself
Biron, she's leading you on
- You should have seen who was leading who
- Yeah, right
Come on "leader"
- Where are we going?
- Pierre
- Sedative With a dose like that, he could sleep for two days
What did that woman say on the phone?
- Yeah - She said that Pierre wanted us to know that blanche's book isn't blanche's book And that blanche didn't write the thirteenth chapter
- Why does he want to us to know that?
- We're wasting our time
- Pierre Lamy, special Agent CorbeiI
- He's taking a nap
- Pierre Lamy national Security, please follow me
Get dressed
- Jean-Guy, please don't go
Look, I won't take a punch
I only have my left but believe you me, it's gonna be a massacre
- Jean-Guy Poitras - Yeah?
- special Agent CorbeiI, please follow me
- I understand, really, I do I would hesitate too
But if you don't fight, my plan to open BeIiveau's safe is dead in the water
- The lumberjack accident hides something big
Bigger than blanche's murder
Hey, twelve guys died for that secret
We'd make the national News
Lapointe?
- Right
"Be where the thief dances"
- Look Biron
The last clue from blanche
"Be where the thief dances"
The thief; that's Poitras, who rigged his fight
And where does he dance?
- Yeah, exactly
Take off your jacket
- You'II fight
- I didn't say it, BIanche did
- Listen, you only have today to train
And you have quite an adversary, might I add
Look, the fight has to last at Ieast ten no, no otherwise I won't have enough time
- Mr a little something for you
- Ah yes!
- Lapointe?
Lapointe?
- I'm warning you Biron, this better be worth it
- It will be, it just has to last fifteen, twenty minutes and I'II be fine
Attention everyone
Don't miss the first ever Super gala
The one and only "Death Hammer" Jean-Guy Poitras
What are you doing moron?
Suzanne!
- Do you smell it?
Try this one Powder smells sweet and dry,
like a good scotch - What are we doing here?
Hunting season hasn't started and I hate wild game
- Hunting is good for the nerves
- I'II calm down when the deal's done and when Armand is
- Never mind Armand Stephanie doesn't want him anymore; he has nothing left here He'II leave on his own
- I don't understand why we should give him his share
- Because you don't rob a guy from the Iast thing he's got
You of all people should know that
- Aside from that, I have a problem with Catherine
- Be patient with her
There are a Iot of things you don't know about her
I asked her to marry me
- You heard me
- You asked her
And what did she answer?
- I Iove her and don't take me wrong but I Iove her more than I ever loved your mother
That journalist is cozying up to her
He'II get out of the way, trust me
- Is that why we're here, so you could tell me this?
- What? Afather and his son can't hunt together without
I just want you to know that sometimes, you have to feel like you're losing things to really appreciate them
Give me your shades
The sun's in my face
- Here Dad
Are you all right Dad?
- Yes, yes, I'm all right
- I got it
- You got it Dad Let's go get it
- Thanks for the flowers, last night
And the note
- You weren't home
- I was there
- I'm going a little too fast, is that it?
- Georges, my sister's husband, thinks that once you know me better, you'II dump me
- Isn't he a little biased?
- still, he's probably right
- Do you really think this is a sex game?
honestly Catherine;
I'm not twenty years old anymore
although I might appear to be
- There's no age for chasing skirts
But that's not the point
- Oh, by the way I'd rather you wouldn't be at the gala, tonight
I'm about to do something that I wouldn't want you to see
- And I'm about to show you something I never thought I couId show
- Catherine, what's wrong?
I don't know what you want to show me but Can it wait?
- I won't have the courage twice
- Go away, go away
- Catherine calm down
- please, please
- OK, I'II leave
Fights, special attractions and the participation of a surprise celebrity
Attention, everyone
- I'm fed up, man
We should have recorded it
- Now you think of that! Damn idiot!
- Why don't you shut up?
- When will you learn to mind your own business?
- What is HeIène doing in the interrogation room, have you seen what state she's in?
- She appeared on TV, Iike the other three, we're looking for a connection
- In the mean time, what do we do about Marcoux?
It's been three days since he disappeared
- I won't send out a search party every time a cheated husband slams the door
- But Dad, it's Marcoux
- I'II tell you one last time Gastonne;
you take things too personal
If you want to become any good at this job
- You think I'm no-good too?
- What you need to be a cop is a cool head, common sense and a gun
You're my daughter but all you've got is the gun
Monette?
Monette it's me
Say, do you know wrestling?
What the hell is a "Death Hammer"?
- So, how are things going?
Any headway? - I've wasted my time
They have no idea why they appeared on TV and they have nothing in common
Aside from the weirdo and the nymphomaniac, they barely know each other
The boxer is a retard
The bi-gendered hairdresser is completely insane
The woman only talked about her husband who left her
And the kid wasn't saying anything
- What have you learned since you've been here?
- What is blocking the TV signal is a magnetic field
- Yes But we need to know where whoever took over your research is transmitting from
The antenna on the mountain?
- I checked
To locate the source, we would need to intercept the signal
This means climbing up there with my instruments and hoping they are transmitting at that moment
- I've already called Georges Ferron to go with you
BeIiveau and I, we have to prepare a first report, and we have nothing to give them
So if you find anything new
hello?
- hello my handsome Christian
It's Dove
- hello Babe!
I was just thinking about you
- well, well
- About you
- I was calling to tell you I'II be arriving tomorrow,
I'II be alone
Tomorrow's fine
alone?
You're brave
- I decided to trust you Christian
- You shouldn't
- I'II be a friend of yours visiting from montreal
We'II do this in broad daylight
real smooth
- You know
I really do like you
- Thanks, I forgot it
I can't be without that clip
Step right up Ladies and gentlemen!
An evening filled with excitement awaits you
Come in and see spectacular fights
We have wrestling, we have boxing We have plenty of TV's so you won't miss anything if someone else appears
Step right up!
- It's up to you
- Hey!
There's a girl here!
- She's not a girl, she's a cop
- careful, her boyfriend is a hairdresser
- You mean her girlfriend is a hairdresser
- You can't leave tonight Pierre
- I'II take a plane tomorrow:
that will be one less freak in Great Bear
- At least tell me what you saw in blanche's book
- It isn't blanche's book
- will you just explain then?
- You looked
You'II pay the price, Great Bear will pay
Go away
- tell me who blanche's heiress is
Why didn't her powers get passed on?
- You'II know nothing
- I feel that blanche's soul is trapped
help me free her
Pierre, help me help blanche
- You don't understand
- No, I don't understand
- Her girlfriend is a hairdresser
- Don't let it get to you
They're all afraid they are freaks too, on the inside
They all are a little, and they know it
It soothes them to see people who are on the outside
- When blanche was here, we could just go see her
- Hey, it's starting!
Ladies and gentlemen!
welcome to
- In the spotlight, idiot
- welcome to the Von Trieck hangar, site of the most incredible entertainment
- This better be worth it, BIanche, or you'II hear from me in the great beyond
- And now Ladies and gentlemen, the first fight of the evening will oppose: In the blue corner,
"Bobby the Mayor" BeIiveau
And in the red corner, "Luigi Big Star" Lapointe
That wasn't in the script
- Hey, I just had a concussion here
- people are supposed to root for me
- Be careful
Put everything exactly back where you got it
If he notices anything, we're done for
- will we have time?
- Yes, Maryse is alone here until six o'cIock
- You think Pierre will be able to?
- He read the book, he had visions
If anyone is capable of saving blanche's soul, he is
We must do it before he leaves
- How many fingers?
- Everyone remembers the words?
- Hey, can you see my finger?
- He's knocked out
- Move away
- Where are we at?
- "Death Hammer"
- Mrs
Why didn't you tell me?
- Pierre, help me!
help me!
- blanche?
"Where the thief dances"
- I didn't know what the sentence meant when I wrote it
- But you were right
- If you want But now I'm here to tell you I was wrong
- tell me everything
Who killed you, who killed Dr the TV, the book
- You're the one who must answer those questions
AII I can tell you now is this:
I've already told you about the books in which each generation of witches writes her discoveries
I have also told you that most of us want to do good, not evil
unfortunately, every thirteenth generation, there is an evil witch
She writes the thirteenth chapter, a bloody chapter, full of maIedictions
- Mom! Stop!
Stop, she can't take it anymore!
- For thirty years, I wrote the twelfth chapter of my book
I couldn't accept that when I died I would have to give my powers to an evil one
So I decided to change the course of things and to skip the thirteenth chapter by passing on my powers to a good and pure being
I chose my son's wife
She accepted to submit herself to a Iong and hard treatment
She fought alone against a thousand demons
I pushed her to the end, in the hopes to save a generation against forces of evil
- Leave Diane alone, is that clear?
- I failed
Thomas lost his wife
Sarah lost her mother
The whole town lost a friend
One last thing
The last victim will serve as a compass
- The last victim will serve as a compass
Thanks Pierre
Now listen
- apparently there are a Iot of bears in the area
A Iot
- November 5th, vote BeIiveau
- And now, the moment you have been waiting for;
the fight opposing, in the red corner, the former Canadian champion, medium weight:
Jean-Guy Poitras
And in the blue corner
You! - Dad!
Dad you can't let that happen
He doesn't have a permit for this
- Come on, can you see me trying to take away their show?
They already hold me responsible for the TV
- Dad, you can't, you can't!
- OK, you're right
Good night - calling me a fag, huh?
Very brave when you're twelve against one with baseball bats, but face to face
Come on you cowards, I have one hand tied behind my back
Come on, big guy, Iet's go!
- You put everything back exactly in its place?
- Yes perfectly
- We have a volunteer ladies and gentlemen:
Rick Cyr
- AII right!
Hey
- Thanks Biron
CorbeiI, we have a problem
- What do we do now?
- We wait
Hoping that the madman who transmits on Great Bear's waves sends another episode
- The madman might be just a joker
To do what he does, one must be deranged
- And you designed the device?
You experimented on humans?
- I was doing research on mental imagery
CorbeiI's the one who pushed me
- She stroked my ego
I was going to make history
national Security offered me a laboratory, volunteer test subjects
I fell for it
- Quit whining
Do you know what's going on?
- Someone pushed my research further
I was able to read the nerve influx of the rats to project images
But I was never able to search their memories
I never had the intention to broadcast
- So The rabbits on TV
- They must have been test subjects
- But what we've been seeing on TV That doesn't come from the mind of a rabbit
What we've been seeing on TV, logically, must have come from The mind of blanche Von Trieck
Except that she's dead
- I don't know exactly how but just before her death, the madman was able make an electronic copy of her brain
It's as if he had taken a photo of her mind to allow him to search her memory like an album
- That guy isn't a madman, he's a genius
- Yeah, a genius! Who has already killed at Ieast two people:
Von Trieck and Dr
- How many have you killed?
- I never killed anybody, I stopped
They wanted me to continue but I refused
- But still, you must have an idea of who might be doing this?
- It has to be someone who knows my research
Those guys are scattered all over the world
Except LefIaguais who's dead
- LefIaguais?
- A signal
We'II locate the transmitter
No! No!
- So
You got to Grande Ourse two days ago
- You're sending me to a hole
- Out of the blue, you ended up at blanche Von Trieck's
- I was waiting for you
- Then you took a night stroll with the old woman
- I don't know the meaning of these sentences but I know they will help you, one by one, to save my soul
- And mine
It's been a Iong time since I've seen such a beautiful women
I thought the clues were leading me to a criminal
- The last victim will act as a compass
- In reality, they were leading me to you
- Lapointe?
BIanche's killer it's Catherine
Lapointe?
Lapointe! It's Catherine!
It's Catherine, Lapointe
Catherine Open the door!
I know you're there
- Georges
- No Catherine!
- Catherine!
- Get in I have to talk to you
I know
- No, I know
- Stephanie
Stef
- Soon it won't hurt anymore, you'II see
- Yes, I need an ambulance at the La Forge hotel, room number two
It looks like a heart attack, hurry up
They're on their way Georges
- Catherine is not a woman for you
You don't know her
You don't know anything about her
- Forget about that OK?
Don't think about that
- Listen
She's the one I Ioved
She was 15, I was 24
I was willing to wait for her but her parents wanted to marry off Suzanne first, her older sister
It was Catherine's idea,
I swear
Catherine was coming to live with us that way we could be together right away
But don't think she didn't love her sister
She adored her
It was for her she did all this
Suzanne was deranged, almost always off in her own world
She would have ended up alone, unhappy
Catherine sacrificed our happiness to offer her sister a normal life
It went wrong when Catherine got pregnant
She cried for weeks, but to protect her sister, she decided to have an abortion
Catherine went to see her
But the abortion didn't work
She went off to montreal to have the baby
He was born a vegetable and a gimp
She never forgave herself
She hid him
And she became obsessed She dedicated her life to finding a way to cure our son
She never succeeded
She's only been back in Great Bear for two, three years
I thought things were better
- Georges Where can I find her?
- You won't find her
- LefIaguais's bimbo is here
- Yes, that's it
It looks like Catherine, Ferron's sister-in-Iaw
- And his mistress
- Yes, exactly
- Ferron I knew he did it on purpose
- Paquette, couldn't you have thought of that?
- LefIaguais's girlfriend? She couldn't tell the difference between a brain cell and an amoeba
At least she didn't look like it
- BeIiveau?
- Not you, your daughter
Very good work, BeIiveau
I will personally see that your efforts be rewarded by a promotion
- Thanks
- This is a very serious case
You saw what happened in Great Bear, on a small scale?
If the discoveries of what's her name?
- Catherine LapIante
- If LapIante's discoveries were found out, if they ended up in the wrong hands
Do you understand? - Yes
- We have to act quickly so that despite a few errors committed in the past, the information concerning this case remains secret
- That I can't
- Sometimes to do the right thing you have to pick the lesser of two evils
I found the coordinates of the transmitter that broadcasted those images last night
- Forget what you know about the Iumberjacks
It won't bring them back;
it's all in the past We need you, right now
- You won't regret it, Captain BeIiveau
- Chief, someone stole a body from the morgue
- Who's body?
- blanche
A bunch of people took her
They're freaking out because of the TV They want to bury her
- Come on!
- BeIiveau, I want my lawyer!
- Buy us some time
Let him see Armand but no one else
- What are you doing here?
- I was looking for Stephanie
She got in the car with Catherine and I can't find her
What's this?
- Catherine It can't be true
- What? - Biron is in danger, your Stephanie too
- What do you mean, in danger?
- Come on, I'II explain on the way
- He's my stepbrother?
- genetically, achilles is even closer to you since I'm your mother's sister
But there isn't a name for that, except "bastard"
- When I found out you're the one who killed mom, I wanted to kill you Catherine, I swear
But now
- Revenge doesn't make the pain go away
only forgiveness can
But people are too weak to forgive
You'II feel so much better after
- So, now it's party time
- I'II sleep here tonight
Take me out for dinner and
- The images that appeared last night were broadcasted from here
- That's close to the old mine
- I'II take a GPS, I'II manage
But make sure your daughter stays on our side until Biron has his accident
After that she won't be able to do anything
This might be a very important day, boys!
- What do you think she'II do once she can search anybody's brain?
- She'II spread joy all around the world
- Chief!
- What? What is it?
- It's Biron
He hung himself in his cell
Oh no!
Somebody! Hurry!
Open the door! unlock the door!
Oh my God!
OK, I got him Go call an ambulance, quick!
- hold on, hold on
- I'm proud of you son
You handled it like a pro
I can go in peace now
- C'mon Dad
- Christian, all I have is yours now
But take care of your sister
- Don't say that Dad, our business has just started
We'II get more wads like these, you'II see
- What's wrong?
- Nothing
- No, I know there's something, what is it Dad?
- It's OK son, it's experience
- Counterfeit
- That two-timing little tramp!
- calm down Christian
- well, thanks guys
- I've had this harness since I played the hanging of Louis-RieI in a college play And now; an escape
- well, it wasn't AIcatraz, but still
- So now we have to go to the morgue, we have to find Stephanie
- The morgue?
- Yes, because the real "last victim" was Dr Mondoux
There's got to be a clue on his body to lead us to Stef - So, he knows everything now?
- You're the one who wanted to split
- Yeah but still Not two days ago he was "that little brat" and now - Get out
- No problem
- Hey!
Don't give me that shit
When they got a hold of you, you were fleeing to montreal with the scoop
- Don't worry Biron, at your age, in those circumstances,
I would have done the same
- But what hurts me is that you didn't tell me face to face
- I I know
- Now, don't tell me you didn't hide a copy of those documents somewhere or I I'II never speak to you again
I really wouldn't have taught you anything
- well
I took some digital pictures
I have them all right here, on mini-disc
- That's my Biron!
OK, now you can go
- Go where?
- To montreal
- No, I can't go alone; you have to come with me
- No, your time has come
You wanted your chance: you got it
- No, no, I couldn't
I came here to save my soul, not my career
Remember?
- Yeah, right
- Look, Saint-Denis will pick you up in half an hour at the Crooked Lake, OK?
One last thing
Listen, a Iong story but
Catherine killed blanche and the doctor
Didn't I tell you not to trust her?
You really liked her didn't you?
- Take care of yourself
- Yeah, thanks for everything
- What do you mean, the morgue is closed? - They've already stolen a body
- Who's?
- blanche's
They're gone to bury or cremate her
They're the only ones left
- It's Dr Mondoux we want to see
- impossible
- The last victim Wait!
Look These are the marks from Paquette and Catherine's device He's the Iast victim
But what does it mean, "The last victim will act as a compass"?
- Armand, if I've learned one thing here it's that sometimes
"The last victim will act as a compass" simply means the Iast victim will act as a compass
- Do you have another way to find Catherine and Stephanie?
- I'm telling you, they took the body into the woods
What do we tell her family? What?
I don't understand;
let me talk to him
Hi, Dad? Yes
What do you mean escaped? - Escaped!
He's gone
I have all the roads under surveillance, the hydroplanes too
He won't go far but he can talk
- He wants his scoop He won't talk
Except that there's more than one lake in the area
- I don't have enough staff to check all the lakes
- Saint-Denis
- What about Saint-Denis?
- He's coming down
He's going to Crooked Lake
- Crooked Lake
Easy, easy
- Don't move Biron!
Stay here!
- You'II take me in
You'II send me to my death? - I have orders You can't leave Great Bear
- Orders from who?
Your father?
CorbeiI? They're in it up to here, Gastonne
- This is a national Security matter
- No, no, this is an anal Security matter
Those two want to save their asses and you know it
- You're only thinking of your scoop, you're not seeing the consequences
- Yes, I'm thinking of my scoop
And the consequences will be the truth will come out and justice will be done
- Don't make me laugh! There always will be injustice Biron
Don't you see?
It won't do any good to play Don Quichotte
Stay here - There's a windmill awaiting me
I know you don't believe what you say
You'd Iike to save your father but it's too late
He did what he did
You'II have to live with the choices you're making today as well
- Come back
- Think about it Gastonne
We never will be
But I've known you for twenty-five years
If there's one thing I know, it's that we'II never be on the side of the liars and cheaters
You might doubt that today
I still doubted it yesterday
But I Iook at myself today, I Iook at you And I'm sure of it
- Biron, don't do this
Biron, come back!
Biron, I Iove you!
I Iove you!
I'm sorry Dad
- You shouldn't be
- My friends
Before blanche can join the spirits of the forest, I have to tell you something
- Catherine
please!
I forgive you
I don't want to lose my memories
- Poor little girl, you're scared
But you'II feel so much better after
I'II only remove the bad ones
You know, at first, I did all this for achilles
With neurology, I was trying to find a way to talk to him To tell him that if I couId start over
But I can't
So I wanted to show him that everyone has something to blame themselves for
Don't you think?
- Stef?
- Catherine, no
Catherine, please
It's over now, Iet me help you
- I can go in peace now
AII I have is yours
- Don't do anything stupid Christian,
look at it as a game
You lost this one, you'II win others
- No, no
I can lose them all but not this one
- You've already all read blanche's book
- Yes
- blanche wanted to skip the thirteenth generation, the thirteenth chapter, the evil one, so she could pass on her powers to someone good
But she failed
That's what she wanted me to tell you
evil exists
It will always exist
We have to keep fighting it, all the time, whether it's inside or outside of ourselves
- OK, but
Who would be the thirteenth?
The bad one?
- Yeah, who's the heiress of blanche's powers?
- For me, there's no doubt
She's the thirteenth
Sarah Von Trieck
- Don't you think you've done enough, Pierre?
First, you disrespect my mother's body, and now, her granddaughter
This little girl is grieving so much since her grandmother died that she hasn't said a word
And you want to make her out to be a demon?
- She's the one I tell you
I'm sure, she's the one
Didn't you hear that?
She said she wants to kill me!
Didn't you hear?
- That's enough Pierre Go have yourself examined
Leave us alone
- You don't believe me, you'II regret it
You'II all regret it
- You want to burn her right here?
- Let's finish this
- It's over now
Let me help you
- Go
You
Stay here
- You were hiding a Iot of things from me
- I never hid that I hid things
- True
- That I was a monster?
- No, that's not it
- Admit it, I am a monster in your eyes now, Iike in my own
- No, no, no Catherine, no
- The look in your eyes was the only hope I had left
- The look in your eyes was what saved me
Thanks to you Catherine, I've changed
- Sit down
- Do you still love me, in spite of everything?
- Yes, in spite of everything, in spite of my own will sometimes
Come on, we've got to get help
- would you forgive me?
- I can tell you're going to break my heart
That, I'm warning you, I won't forgive you for
- It's often dangerous to get too close to the truth you know
- Is this a challenge or a warning?
- A bit of both
I thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did, we would be forced to forgive one another
- Catherine, it's useless now
- Right
It's useless
- samuel?
- Marcoux?
BIanche?
- I want to see him again
- Very interesting, so to conclude
- Those inhumane treatments were forced upon twelve innocent people for highly immoral research
- So, there are still missing chapters to this story
You will be reporting those soon
- Oh yes, absolutely, Marc
I can already tell you that the topic of this secret research should surprise everyone
- Very interesting Mr
Tune in next week Marc Bonsecours saying see you soon
- Where are you?
- I'm in front of blanche's house - You're asking yourself if you have saved your soul?
- If I've saved my soul?
well, if it means that I'm able to look forward despite what's behind
I think so
- Are you going to drop the bottle?
- well, it's actually very quiet in Great Bear, isn't it?
- It is except when you're there
- Bye Lapointe
- Are you there?
Yeah, sorry it was Lapointe
I couldn't - I'm in my bath too now
Sorry, it's funny because It's the first time that
I imagine you
- well
- To begin I will tell you how I killed my mother
- Hey Luc
You're up late again tonight?
In the Iast episode
- Avery bad cycle has begun
- If I catch the guy who did this
- We'II catch him Marcoux We'II catch him and he's going to pay
- The body seems to have been partially buried then dragged on the ground
- You went strolling outside with the old woman, in the middle of the night, without any apparent reason
AII of a sudden, a kind of shadow attacked you You fainted and you never saw her alive again
- Mr Mayor: you deserve nine out of ten
- Sir? You lost this
- Man, that's Poitras' face
- I Iove GiIbert
That's why I'II go down after the sixth round against taylor
- Ah fuck! - I'm not a fag, OK?
- Boys!
- I'II call the others
I'm not a fag
Somebody fired a shot
My God, Sophie, I'm sorry
Not one word on what happened, OK?
I heard a shot, I came right away but there was no one here
He shot himself before someone else did
Don't say that, the guys aren't crazy
They wouldn't have killed him for a couple grants
Not for that either:
look
"I'm not a fag"
Can you believe it?
What were you all doing here?
well
We all gather here to talk about blanche
I've invited you before
BIanche is dead
So?
We can still talk about her
You believe she transmitted her powers, Iike she said?
I believe in what I see
And these days, the picture isn't very nice
BIanche also believed in what she saw except she saw a Iot more and a Iot further than we do
I know you've secretly been to see her too
Once or twice
Out of curiosity, Iike everyone else
When the bear growls, it will be exactly 9AM
You're tuned in to Great Bear Radio, with Simone Letendre
So, Mr Mayor?
Everything is under control
still, there have been three suspicious deaths within a week
I can't keep people from shooting themselves
I'm deeply sorry for the families It's tragic
As for Mrs Von Trieck, I'm grieving like everyone else
The investigation is under way but let's not put the horses before the cart
- Ha! The horses
- still, she's the most liked and respected woman in town
Any leads? Suspects? Anything at all?
- horses in front of the cart
- The priority is the safety of the population
We obviously have several leads, I can't give any details
- Come on! Come on!
Give them details!
- people seem to think that you don't know the details
What people?
- Everybody
- And what about the TV, do you know anything about that?
people would Iike to know when it will come back
I made a call to competent authorities this morning to have them send us their top experts
In my days, there was no television
- In other words, you have no clue what's going on
well thank you Mr Mayor for the enlightenment - That's right!
Thank you very much You have no idea what's going on with the television or who savagely killed our beloved blanche
- Poor blanche
- She's quite determined, your ex
I'm starting to understand her
Too bad I'm leaving; I couId have told you what to do with her
Never mind Simone
You can't leave;
you're a witness in a murder investigation
Might as well make the most of it and do a story
Biron, I'm tired, I need some rest
- Do you think we ever got any rest?
We worked twelve hours a day and at night
Nothing ever happens in Great Bear
Then, you come here, there's a murder, a manhunt, suicides, TV freaks out
Biron I have nothing to do with your farfetched tales
- I won't fetch anything very far, at my age
When I found you last night, there was this paper at your feet
Are you writing poetry? - Poetry is boring
But at Christmas time, sometimes we'd sing songs
- Yeah, that's it I write poetry
Don't forget what blanche said;
your fate is linked to hers
My fate I'm not dead
What is a dead person's fate?
- Poor blanche
- follow me, I'II show you
- We'd sing What was it that we'd sing?
"The paddle leads us round and round"
The paddle leads us round and round
She got me the old bat!
She got me
And the elections are coming up
Fanatics;
it could cost me my mayor's job
BIanche was all that's good in the world, all put together in the same person, who would listen to them and guide them
She told them what they wanted to hear and made them believe anything - No way!
- How would you know?
Lapointe's deposition
Yeah, that's what he told me at the hospital, word for word
Big surprise!
Why would it have changed?
What did they teach you at police academy?
Why would he lie?
BIanche left him a paper with clues we should follow
Hey, the case is muddy enough without me worrying about the old woman's hallucinations
Forget it!
About Suzanne Ferron; I'm starting to think I'm wasting my time
Proofs were erased, purposely You don't say?
By the way the cleaners will be there tomorrow morning, before Thomas gets out of the hospital
In the mean time, don't touch anything and keep your nose out of it
Look Sarah; Daddy's in top shape
Oh yes!
Now I've got it!
I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner!
Another stroke of genius?
Hey, hey!
Don't mock me little Miss Ferron
I'm thinking of changing my last name
I'II take my mother's
There's an idea!
Your father's gonna have a cow!
I'd say it looks like you hate him as much as I do
I'm sorry about blanche
Yeah
I'm sorry about your mother too
She still hasn't said a word eh?
Poor child
We're closing up
I've got an idea
Fantastic?
Extraordinary?
Insane?
AII of the above!
Do you think what happened to gilbert was because of us? Because of what we did with blanche's book?
Of course not
gilbert Thibodeau never needed any help to get into trouble
I don't feel so good since blanche is gone
Everything is backwards and
You're too sensitive Honey
BIanche wouldn't have liked us playing with forces we can't control
Sophie was putting us on
You really think she left her body and saw blanche with wires coming out of her head?
She rose above the table, you saw her
well, Iet's keep that between us for now, OK? Yeah
Wait for me; I'II give you a lift
I've never felt that way in all my Iife, Pierre
I felt myself leave
I don't know where but I was floating
Come here
I think I-I-I'm gonna go now
Pierre, Pierre, come lay down, you're tired
No, no
I felt powerful and free
Excuse me
What's the matter?
If you're gay too, then I'm the one who's gonna shoot myself
No, that's not it
I just can't! You're played the tease long enough
At first, it turned me on but It's not funny anymore, Pierre
It wasn't my intention Sophie, I'm sorry
If it's because of gilbert, you know there was nothing left between us I have to go
Pierre, I need a man!
I need you
Hurry up Biron; I'm having a shitty day
You better have a good reason to bring me back here
But you'II find the "cream of the crop" of Great Bear here You should enjoy that
I have nothing against cream;
it's sour milk I can't stand
AII right, OK I see everybody's in a good mood this morning
would you put that on, please Gastonne?
I thought all the TVs in town had nothing but snow?
Yeah but this is just a monitor
There's no antenna, nothing to receive the waves, it takes it's signal from the VCR
Biron, I know what a monitor is
OK, now, look at this
Indeed
Look at that
- He can't leave his wife like this - My VCR was programmed to record when it happened
- So I'II go down during the sixth round against taylor That's fine and dandy but
Wait wait wait
- Just for him
Watch this
well
I'II be damned It's that bear
The old woman's stuffed bear
BIanche's didn't tape her meetings with people
No, but there's something there
There's got to be a link between blanche's murder and Poitras and the TV
And the rabbits that appeared during Poitras' fight
- well, why not?
It would be logical I don't know if it's logical but it reminds me that something's not right with your deposition
BIanche's big book you were talking about;
the night she was killed, you saw it, you're sure?
Yes, the book
Very nice, with a leather binding
We searched everywhere;
well, the killer took off with it then?
I've got an idea Come on Biron
Hey! Woah!
What idea?
I don't work for the police But you're still a suspect
It's to your advantage to cooperate
You'II get the autopsy report on the old woman?
Give us a copy and we'II tell you what we have found on our end
OK, OK
But not a word to my father eh?
I'm not supposed to get involved in that
No, no, no
We have a story now, don't we?
What's your idea? To get the autopsy report
That's a good one
But what do we do for Gastonne;
we've got nothing for her You see Biron; we have to reconstitute the events of that night, right?
We have to speak with blanche's son; he was in the house too
The autopsy report should help us reconstruct the facts and put the pieces together
Ah, cool But what do we do for Gastonne?
I have to take a shower, Biron
Come on, Iet's go
A gala?
A gala?
A gala
Sarah, hand me your drawings
Music!
Comedy!
Fights!
Magic!
cocktails! A memorable evening of entertainment!
people are looking for distractions, it's gonna fly big!
So we test the show here, then we take it on the road
Woah, and Sarah; you did all this to illustrate the evening?
Super, Boss!
Where do we start? Listen, we need big names
Poitras, our champion, is in town
- But Poitras he's, shall we say out of commission
- And grieving
- gilbert - Grieving?
So?
I'm grieving too
Life goes on guys
Life is bigger than everything, guys
Live doesn't stop here eh?
Against the odds!
He must have really loved his GiIbert
To be this sad with thirty milligrams of morphine in your blood
Never seen anything like it
What's up with you?
Did you call me here to talk about my wardrobe?
No I want to know how Mom died
You know it, Dad knows it and I don't know why you're protecting him
If he's threatening you, you'd better tell me
I'II help you That time is over Stef
I don't want any help anymore
especially coming from you
If someone falls down, you help them up just enough so they can walk if they lean on you
And when they're too much of a burden
You take off
Look at me Look at Mom
You're such an asshole
Oh yeah! That's another thing;
I'm done being nice
As of now, I'm an asshole
Now, if you'II excuse me, I have a meeting to get to
- Excuse me Stephanie;
I'm looking for Dr Mondoux
It's for an autopsy report
My mother's?
No blanche's
Because your mother Yes, she was incinerated the same night
I know Everybody knows
Yeah
Anyway
Don't bother Gastonne, it's useless now
According to Mondoux, she was partially buried, and then dragged for a good distance after her death
Why would a killer bring his victim back in her own house?
Yeah
Paquette
Edouard Paquette
Mondoux has tried to contact him but he couldn't get a hold of him
- No, no tell Mondoux tell him, I'II take care of it
Everything's under control
I can help you, trust me What did I tell you?
There's no "Dad" on the job OK?
Why don't you go out for a while?
I have to think now
Josee, call agent CorbeiI from national Security, it's urgent
Good; I taped my stand up
Quite a number that one!
Soft, vulnerable one minute, cold and cruel the next
I wish I'd figured her out that quickly
She gets to you doesn't she?
Yeah, but I'm done groveIing Good for you
I know the type
They use men either as a doormat or as a pedestal
The important thing is that they can walk all over them
In fact, these girls are born unhappy and stay that way
You seem to know what you're talking about I've known a Iot of women Biron
Before finding the right one
You, Biron
You wouldn't do that would you? Use someone to get ahead?
Uh no, no
I mean, love has to be an exchange Otherwise it's unhealthy
well, Miss Catherine
You know, I've done a Iot of thinking, in fact,
I haven't slept all night And
I've decided to forgive you for breaking my heart if you'II accept a date
You bargain your indulgences
Ah but it was my friend Biron who said that love has to be an exchange
I accept but find something original
That's another type one should stay away from
That's more the type you'II never get close to, Biron
I'm not interested anyway
Where are we going?
I didn't see anything the night of the murder
I was at home watching TV and I had a seizure
Now, I don't want to hear about my mother's scary tales anymore
Biron, you should know that
Yes but, it's important, it might be linked to her death
I always said it was going to kill her
I don't want to hear about her or her books anymore, OK?
Don't you see I'm trying to forget? Ah yes, that's right, she told me she had two big books
You know, with leather bindings
They seemed very important to her
Right, two books
well now, the the books have disappeared
Just as well
Honey, we're in a bit of a hurry right now
What's the matter?
Kitten? Do you have a fever?
You're burning up
You're all red Kitten
In two years, it's the first time that it's so
No, no I wasn't saying
I mean I don't want to sound corny but
When I wake up in the morning and think that the beautiful girl next to me is my wife
I'II always remember the first day I set foot in here and blanche introduced us
She knew right away that it wouId work between us, huh?
We'II miss her eh? Oui
It's the emotions
That little brat!
Where the hell is Gastonne?
About time
Here's the autopsy report
What have you found?
We spoke to Thomas Von Trieck at the hospital
would you have a pocket-knife or something?
BIanche didn't have one big book; she had two
Yeah, so? well, I don't know
Do you have a screwdriver?
We'd have to read them to know
We'd have to find them first
And the piece of paper that blanche gave to Lapointe in the woods, did you find it?
Oh, that
hello
You're the only one
I hope so!
Christian doesn't want to see me anymore
I don't understand; he hates me
He doesn't really hate you
AII my Iife, all I've been trying to do is save the world And I can't do it
That's not true
You saved me
When you found me,
I was all messed up with a biker gang after me
Without you, I was lost
still today
You're sweet, but I'm done living for everyone else and turning the other cheek
From now on, it an eye for an eye
What will revenge get you?
Look at Lapointe who wants to kill me whenever he sees me
What was that?
Moron!
You want me to to book you in?
We don't have much for you but after our visit to the Von Trieck's, we should be able to help you Biron!
Don't go in there
It's a secured area
Sam
Sam
Come on, it's late
- Hey! hello Gorgeous!
Hey, guys! Look how nice she is to her little brother
Eh Sam?
She's so nice to you
It's not lack of respect; I worry about you
It'II pass, we must look ahead
I don't believe in accidents
And not only for Suzanne
When something happens, when someone is born
Stop, Catherine Stop
Stop torturing yourself
If only you wanted to
That child is my son too Stop!
If only you had wanted
I Ioved you so much Georges
And for so long It's not possible anymore
You and me; we can't let it end
It lasted this long, despite everything
Take the time to think about it
You should get some rest
Yes, you're right
I have to get some rest
I have to get some rest but
Stay right where you are!
From now on, I'm your partner What?
I take a third of the profits on everything that's illegal
I don't give a damn about
But I have plans for the bar
There'II be shows in here We have to hurry
There's no TV, people need entertainment
But for starters, you'II tell me all about the deal you were making when I walked in with Mom
I want my share
You have about ten seconds to decide
You want to go to jail?
Fine, I'II go too but you're not going to blackmail me
Christian, we can talk about it but
hello, Gastonne?
Christian Ferron Hi
Uh What's up?
Christian?
hello Marcoux?
BeIiveau
No, not Robert, Gastonne, Smart-ass!
You're not on duty tonight
I have a question for you
What's that?
honestly
Do you think I'm a good cop? Eh well
That's what I thought
Sophie, where's your daughter now?
At her grandmother's
I think blanche's soul is still close to us
Yes, when I saw her, she was tied up, she seemed imprisoned
Imprisoned by what?
By what, I don't know
But when GiIbert
I mean, there was a bang and I fell back down
Sophie, Sophie, we'II just go now
Yeah Aunt Sophie, or we'II stay and you can go get some rest
No, no, no We can't leave blanche in that state
What can we do?
We have to decode blanche's book
I'm sure the answer is in there
Her book BIanche never allowed us to touch it
Yet, she gave it to Pierre
Why him?
well, there's nothing upstairs
unless we missed something in the report
BIanche gave you that paper You threw it out
Then a little boy brought it back to you
And when you were on the verge of giving up, the crazy old man at the restaurant started singing: "The paddle leads us round and round "
Biron, that was the purpose of the first sentence
Keep me from giving up and keep me here, in Great Bear Yes!
That's just like blanche
OK Read the second sentence
"He who gathers the mane has seen and will see again"
Isn't there a story about some golden mane?
The mane the mane
According to Gastonne's report, they found nothing in the bear's fur, nothing in blanche's hair
It's not really a mane but they found hair from twelve different people under a chair upstairs
That's odd, isn't it?
Yeah but with all people that come to see her, it's kind of normal
But Biron, there certainly wasn't twelve people that went under the chair in one day
He who gathers the mane the mane
There must be a hair salon in Great Bear?
- Who works there?
It's it's
He does
You're trying my patience son
Come on, get the strap!
You never hesitated before!
Georges, Iet him go
- Mr Ferron?
- What do you want Mike?
Turn on your TV, quick!
I'II let you think about it until tomorrow
It's not that you're not a good cop It's it's just not natural for you Your mind is too nuanced, know what I mean?
So, to be a good cop, you have to be narrow minded?
No, seriously, Gastonne; what made you become a cop?
You mean, "who made me?"
You followed someone to the academy?
I ran away from someone who hurt me
You, the first day you arrived in Great Bear, you found the woman of your dreams
Two years already
I spend my Iife in Great Bear and
- Attention all units There's someone else on TV
It's
Keep an eye out in case things heat up
Marcoux! Find that person and make sure they're safe
So far, it has meant bad luck to
Pierre Lamy, it's Pierre Lamy
It's Pierre Lamy
Her?
She doesn't know
I couldn't tell her Because she loves me and I don't want her to stop
Gastonne loves me because she thinks I'm a man
To have both sexes isn't being a man
I have one ovary and one testicle
I'm not a man
If you could see it
If Gastonne saw it
I'd rather hurt her
I'd rather she went away
I'd rather
Anything but that
Hey! Imagine that!
You can with yourself
How do you do it?
That's it!
Him what?
That's why blanche gave him the book
Pierre is the heiress to her powers
Oh my God!
Doctor, are you in your office?
well, yes, obviously
Doctor
Doctor, tell me you're alone?
alone?
Doctor?
Doctor!
In the Iast episode - Avery bad cycle has begun
- hold me tight Armand
- They can't stand themselves without TV
Look at them!
They're all watching out for the next scandal
- Look at them closely; they're shaking They're all shitting their pants for fear of being the next one
- What about the TV, do you know anything about that?
- I made a call to competent authorities this morning to have them send us their top experts
- Paquette is the only one who can help us to understand what's going on
- He reads the rats' thoughts?
- Better than that, he turns them into images
- If he knew I slept with practically everything in a uniform in Great Bear
- well thank you Mr Mayor You have no idea what's going on with the television or who savagely killed our beloved blanche
- She's quite determined, your ex
- You seem to know what you're talking about
- I have known a Iot of women Biron, before finding my own
- See you again soon, Mr Lapointe
- So, the next one would be: "Got cells"
- Yeah, well, they've been in order since the beginning
- Got cells, got cells, got cells, got cells, got cells
- Come on, come on!
- My glove
That's Armand
Stop it Sweetheart
Mommy's doing this for your own good
Oh no
Biron, samuel said: "Got cells"
Georges, have you seen it?
- I don't know
He hasn't said anything yet;
maybe he won't say anything at all
About us anyway
- I doubt that I'II call you back, OK?
Mommy will be back
Madame Von Trieck;
promise me that you will never tell Stephanie
- Armand, what hurts people the most isn't what we tell them but what we don't
- No, you don't
Her name is Dove
She's beautiful and wild and she's after you because you betrayed her
That's why you're hiding in Great Bear
- But how
- You told Stephanie that you were hiding from your old gang
- It's true I didn't want anything to do with the business anymore and Dove had put a hit on my head
- Yes, beautiful Dove is mad at you, but it's not a business matter:
it's her heart you betrayed
like you're betraying Stephanie by not telling her
- No I Iove her
- Yes, and you will tell her
- No!
Never!
- Oh yes, I can see it
She will learn everything from your own mouth
Never trust anyone, Sarah
Ah!
Lapointe
Biron, she kissed me, right here!
- Good for you In the mean time, HeIène Marcoux's brother said the fourth sentence
And Armand LafIamme appeared on TV
This is where you were coming from the other day
- You must be very careful; someone could spot you in the area
always come on a bicycle
- Hey, don't give me orders, Buddy
- Hey, calm down!
I wouldn't have expected that from you
I only told them who to call to find the material and the ingredients
From there, it's just a recipe
hello?
Yes, Armand is here What?
OK, fine we'II wait here
- What's wrong?
- Nothing we wait here
- What's going on?
- I told you, nothing
Hey, what do you do with that?
- You are the worst liar I've ever heard
- Don't you get it?
The days when you pretended to be a good boy and fucked my sister are over I'm the boss now
You're acting just like your father and you always said he was a dumb-ass
- You never stop, do you?
My father said to wait here
I don't know what's going on but if something's happened to Stephanie
You believe Pierre's story now?
- Biron, I said, "let's suppose"
Listen to this
The night she died,
BIanche leaves with me for the woods, OK?
meanwhile, Pierre goes into the house to look in the book
So, chances are Sarah saw the killer
- well, probably probably according to Pierre there's a chance
Come on, that story will never fly
- No, no, Biron
It would explain the footprints in the kitchen, the haIf-done burial and the return of the body to the house
- Let's suppose, Iike you say
But it's probably after ten o'cIock right now
little Sarah, who doesn't speak, is probably asleep
And according to me, chances are Stephanie won't welcome you with much hospitality
- Ah! Biron, you're absolutely right
- So
Oh no!
That girl intimidates me
- Biron, all girls intimidate you
- Hi
This might seem strange but it's a Iong story but
I'd Iike to talk to Sarah - Sarah's in bed
Come back some other time if you want to play with her, OK?
- It's really important
I I have some questions for her
Biron, she hasn't said a word
Yes, I know but
That idiot Lapointe sent you, is that it?
Can't he mind his own business?
- No, that wasn't him
I mean I'm quite capable of myself
I just want to know if she saw whoever hurt blanche
- She saw someone take off on a four-wheeIer
- On a four-wheeIer
- The little brat is here!
Come on Biron!
Armand
Stef!
I thought something had happened to you
- You were right
Just tell me you're not associated with my father
Oh no Oh no
- I saw him He can't be very far
- Got him!
Come here!
That's the little boy who gave me blanche's paper
- Luc, what are you doing here this late?
- You like staying up late, don't you?
Look You gave me that paper eh?
Where did you get it?
And how did you know it was mine?
- Luc, Luc, Luc You and Sarah and the others, when's the Iast time you saw Mrs Von Trieck?
- I don't remember
- Listen Luc, huh?
It's very important that you tell us when you saw
Mrs Von Trieck for the Iast time
- The last time? - Yes
- It's when she gave us pops the other day
Stay here
You little bastard, get over here
Get over here!
- Your son stays out late
- He's not my father
- Stay here
- What's your problem?
You fancy little boys?
Is that it?
- Come on Rick, relax
- You're right Luc: run
You're better off outside than with him
- I have to bring him back to his mother if I want to have any fun tonight
Come on, get over here Hurry up!
But we'II see each other again, you and I
What will become of this child?
- He doesn't look like the kind of kid who would be dragging corpses in the middle of the night
His problems are elsewhere
- Some days, Biron, humanity discourages me, you have no idea
Don't listen to blanche Don't listen to blanche It's dangerous
- But somebody's got to do it
- No, not you
- Somebody's got to do it
- No - Somebody's got to do it
Somebody's got to do it
Somebody's got to
Somebody's got to do it
- Diane, Diane
- Thomas, Thomas
It'II be OK
It was just a mild one
You called me Diane
Thomas
I can't take it anymore
I'm worried about Sarah
She's weird
Sometimes I think she's talking to me in my head
She needs her father
Everybody keeps calling to find out when blanche's funeral will be
I don't know what to tell them
You act like nothing happened
You spend your whole days organizing boxing matches, I
I'm really sorry Stephanie
You really loved Armand, eh?
I just want him to come back
- well, Gastonne said if there's no news soon, they'II organize a search party
- Just want him back
Did SamueI say anything, since last night?
- He mumbles all the time
Sometimes you can make out words, sometimes not
- He's like that since, uh
- Since the accident
About ten years ago, a bunch of Iumberjacks left in a helicopter to work in the North
Coming back, the chopper crashed
They all died except Sam
Some hunters found him, Iike that, two weeks later
- He wasn't hurt?
- No
- Got cells got cells
cells cells
You're tuned in to Great Bear Radio with Simone Letendre
At the bear's growl, it will be exactly 9 o'cIock
Rise and shine my little bear cubs!
The awakening wasn't too hard?
No, TV still isn't back but we were treated to a new episode starring one of our citizens, last night
Poor Armand, poor Stephanie
Ah, but it's not easy finding love
Each time we open the door to our heart to let love in, we never know what else can get in at the same time, huh?
Fear, pain, malice
But maybe also tenderness, joy, happiness
Who knows?
We never know
- Happy Birthday darling!
But, Marie, I don't drink
One glass of wine and I'm drunk
- This is for the day I leave you
You won't be able to do without this
- I Iove your sense of humour
- Yeah, it's yours rubbing off
- Keep it
But I never want you to use it because I'II never leave you
- I promise
Where is my real gift?
- Come here
Marie!
OK, the paper in Doctor Mondoux's hand: did you find out what it is?
What were you doing at the Von Trieck's last night?
- We wanted to talk to Sarah
- well Nothing
- What was the Doctor's paper?
- Give me a break OK?
We had an agreement
Since the beginning I've given you all I've had and I don't get anything back in return
- Yes I know - You're hiding things from me
You went to see Pierre too
Did he give you the idea to talk to Sarah?
What did he say to you? - Go ask him, you'II find out
He doesn't want to speak to me and everyone at the station thinks he's a freak
- You don't say?
- Hey there, bottle Neck
Quit it, all right?
Spit it out or else
- Swear that you won't use it against Pierre
- Biron, you can't sell out your sources to the police like that
- You can't treat my friends this way either
- Hey That's him
- Pierre was at blanche's house the night she died
He said he saw the kids bring her body back
- Come on The kids didn't kill blanche
- No, I don't think so either but Stephanie said Sarah saw someone take off on a four-wheeIer
- Aren't you
That famous journalist ?
- Yeah, aren't you ?
Bernard
- Yeah, yeah, Louis-Bernard Lapointe
That's it! - well hi
So what about SamueI's sentence? "Got cells"?
- Lapointe thinks it has to do with the accident ten years ago, but
- The Iumberjacks?
- Yeah, the Iumberjacks
- Don't you have, Iike a talent, a magic trick or something?
Or a malformation or a scar
- Come on
- What? Scars are cool
- No, no I won't be a clown in your freak show, all right?
- If you change your mind
- No, I won't change my mind, forget it OK?
- Let's go We'II stop bothering Mr Big Star
- So, now that the stool pigeon has talked, could we find out what was on Doctor Mondoux's paper?
- A small piece of a scientific magazine
- Like any of the hundreds in his office Great!
- Like any of the hundreds, yes
But why that one?
I did some research;
it's from "Neuroscience En Avant"
And guess who's on the cover?
The scientist who's in Great Bear to fix the TV signal
I ordered the magazine from the national Library
- Which will probably get here in two to three days
So, in the mean time
In the mean time, tell me the story of the Iumberjacks
- There were twelve guys
- We call them the Iumberjacks but they didn't really have any skills
Kind of the losers of the area
And when you're considered a loser in Great Bear
- Cream of the crop for sure
- The municipality hired them to work on a piece of land where they would have put up a radar station
- A radar station?
But, that's not municipal department
- I just called the mayor's office
The documents about that contract have disappeared from the files
- We have to talk to the mayor, to your father
- He won't say anything
If the documents aren't there, he decided it
If they still exist though, I know where they are
In the safe in his office
- Let me guess; the problem is that he's the only one who knows the combination
- No, the problem is that he's the only one who has the key
- I have good news and bad news
- The bad news?
- There's no doubt The waves producing the images on TV are of identical nature to the ones I was obtaining with my device, ten years ago
- incredible The good news?
- I've identified what could be the emitting source or at Ieast a relay
Those dishes down there
- We're getting closer
AII of my ex-coIIaborators have been contacted, it's beyond me
- exactly Whoever is doings this is beyond you Paquette
I find this most exciting
The more reason for me to worry
I don't want to interview Edouard Paquette
I just want to talk to him for two minutes
What's the difference?
Listen, can you just tell me where I can find him?
- Even Gastonne can't talk to him
OK, after "Got cells"?
"Be there where the thief dances"
What does that mean?
Every time we get a lead, it goes absolutely nowhere
We have a new sentence which gives us a new lead and it's a complete mess
- No, no Biron
Those leads don't stop, they slow down
And they all point in the same direction
- Oh yeah?
Which one? - I don't know yet
But I trust blanche's clues
- So, go join Pierre Lamy's gang
- The hairdresser?
actually, I'm certain we'd find very interesting things in that book he took from blanche's house
- blanche's big book is full of old wives' tales spread over thirteen generations
- Biron, to solve a problem, you have to go back to its origins
You have to cut it at the root
Fine OK
Not only are the leads we have absolutely ludicrous, they're cold as ice
- Edouard Paquette, don't you find that strange?
A neurologist to fix a TV signal problem?
- That accident always seemed very strange to me
And now, the TV freaks out
We have to open BeIiveau's safe
- No, that's illegal
- I don't give a damn
At least, it isn't "esoteric blah blah"; it's concrete stuff
- Picking the Chief of police's pocket never did anybody any good
I have an idea
BeIiveau might be the chief
hello?
This is EmiIe Biron, yes
You wanted Louis-Bernard Lapointe for your gala?
You shall have him
- Out of the question!
- Under one condition
- Did you hear what Armand said on TV?
He's in deep shit
- Christian, the merchandise isn't for you
- To be a good salesman, you have to know your product
- We only have one buyer and they're very satisfied;
it's not necessary
- only one buyer, for now But I have some expansion projects
- Georges, your son is completely stoned
- Never mind Christian
What were you doing with Lapointe?
- What, Lapointe?
- Yes, Lapointe
- Yes - You spend a Iot of time with him
- I'm not denying it either
He's a charming man, we have a Iot in common
Anyway, it's none of your business anymore Georges
- A Iot in common! We have a son; we have a family in common What do you want; you want us to get married?
Then we'II get married
- No, you don't understand
- Mr Ferron!
We're ready
- Where are you? Who are you talking to?
There's an emergency here, Christian isn't in any shape
montreal will be phoning in two seconds
- I'II call you later, OK?
Love you
Christian Ferron
hello
- Christian, you'II have to admit that our second date can't be any worse than the first
- Did you know that your voice is really sexy?
- I won't say I've never been told before
I have a feeling we'II get along, you and I, Christian
Our deal will go a Iot smoother this time, right?
- The first time, we didn't know each other
I've told you my name, what's yours?
- call me Bird - It's Dove, isn't it?
- I guessed it, didn't I?
Your voice is so soft, it suits you, Dove
- You don't scare me with your big guns
You don't want to tell me your real name?
I'II call you Dove - OK
- Dove?
help, somebody!
HeIène, HeIène!
I just want him to come back blanche
Make him come back, I beg of you!
Hush, you can't make any noise
people will hear you, stop it
I don't know what I was expecting by coming here so late tonight, if only to see you again for a moment
Hope to see you soon
Sarah is asleep
Don't worry, things will work out
- I just wonder where Great Bear is going without blanche
- To hell most likely
But you know, she isn't really gone yet
- You feel her too?
But it's like she's mute, like Sarah
- Do you know why the Natives never settled near Great Bear?
- When I was young, one of my really old great-aunts came to visit from holland
My grandfather showed her around the mine and the town
In those days it was still the "Von Trieck Mine"
He was proud
Then my great-aunt, who had pretty much the same powers as blanche, asks my grandfather what "refracting stones" are
So my grandfather explains;
When she hears that, my great-aunt is overtaken by vertigo and starts shouting: "Stop!
Stop!"
You should have seen it;
the guys in the mine were freaking out
So my grandfather takes her by the shoulders and asks her:
"What's the matter?"
She manages to catch her breath, and all cross-eyed, starts saying: "You shouldn't move this rock, it is rock that never burns;
God put it there to block the gates of hell
If you keep digging, demons from the abyss will come to the surface and torment you "
Then my grandfather grabs her, shoves her in the truck and says: "Crazy old woman, go back where you came from, you prophet of doom!"
well, you know what?
The Natives had the same legend Pretty much word for word
That's why they never settled near Great Bear
- So what?
You think that
- I think I don't like prophets of doom!
- Come on, BIanche wasn't a prophet of doom!
- How would you know, Ferron?
No, but really
How would you know?
- Rum and Coke, just the way you Iike it
I'm glad you came by
I have things to be forgiven for
- You can go
I'm not keeping you
- You know very well what I want
- You know very well that I won't give it to you
You'II have to wait until the deal is done to get your share, like the rest of us
- I need money to leave town
And if Dove knows I'm involved, it's not good for you either
- I know, but if Dove finds you, she'II kill you
So I bet you'II make sure she doesn't know you're here
See how much I trust you?
- I'm not alone in this
What about Christian?
Do you really trust him?
- He's my son
I'm giving him a chance to earn my trust
Lay low for a few days and everything will be fine
- Huh? What?
- You like it, eh?
- Yes, yes, yes, EmiIe, EmiIe!
EmiIe, EmiIe!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah
- I don't know
AII she said was: "I have to talk to you"
then she hung up Come on, hurry up!
- No, I'm much better now
I should be going
You got what you wanted?
Yeah
It's been clear, lately, that I will never have anything else
Even this, I didn't think anyway
What Lapointe said about me That I'm an opportunist and unhappy
- Ah, forget about that
- No, no, there's truth in that, I know
But I'd Iike you to give me a second chance, because
I don't want to stay unhappy
Think about it, OK?
Yeah, OK
I'II think about it
She's here
- would you stop saying "She"?
- He, she it doesn't matter
- Forgive me girls I haven't slept in two days
I'm translating the book
- And what does it say?
- A Iot of things but
This isn't blanche's book
- What do you mean, it isn't blanche's book?
BIanche gave it to you
- She didn't give it to me
I took it
- So, what does that change?
- You stole it
That changes everything
He's not the heiress to the powers
- explain yourself
- Every one of these books was written over thirteen generations
- Yes, one chapter per generation, and?
- The thirteenth chapter of this book has already been written
- Then blanche wrote the thirteenth
- blanche didn't write in this book
And she didn't write the thirteenth chapter of any book
- Get it out of here!
- Take the book outside!
Pierre, Pierre, it's all right
It's OK, it's all right
We have to get him to the hospital
Go look in the back, there must be a wheelbarrow
We'II roll him to the car
The
The book is gone
At dawn on a spring day in 1528, a Spanish fleet from Cuba prepared to land an army of conquistadors on the shores of North America,
They had come to find new lands of gold
It was Thursday the 14th of April, 1528, when they came ashore.
The beginning of the most disastrous of all the expeditions of the conquistadors, and yet one of the great epic stories in the history of the Americas.
The Spanish had called this Florida, the land of flowers,
But they found a strange and evil country,
That summer, over 300 conquistadors struggled through these swamps,
Their leader, Panphilo de Narvaez, was arrogant and incompetent,
They had no interpreters, Their food supplies ran out,
And worse, they were picked off by hostile tribes,
The last survivors of those native peoples are still here, the Seminole,
They have fiercely defended their independence ever since,
So you are the only Native American people within the USA who never submitted...
Right. The only tribe to never sign a treaty of submission.
The elements of Florida, a very, very good ally.
Snakes and alligators, Europeans worried more about them.
Again, these people had no knowledge of Florida.
Narvaez had been licensed by the King of Spain to discover and conquer Florida,
He hoped to find cities here with large populations and gold
Instead, he found a poor landscape totally unsuitable for colonisation,
But he pushed his army on further into the nightmare,
"If only Narvaez had come here to seek the well-being of the Indians, " one Spaniard wrote, "and not to wade through their blood to gain ill-gotten wealth, "
But his capacities did not come up to his dreams,
With autumn coming on, the expedition was on the point of collapse,
Hoping now just to save their lives, they struggled down to the sea below Tallahassee,
But there was no sign of their ships,
The fleet had given them up for dead
They're starving, disillusioned, and Narvaez weighs up the situation.
He thinks the Spanish settlements in Mexico are only a few leagues down the coast.
In fact, they're 1,000 miles.
So he decides to build boats to escape.
And on the 22nd of September, nearly 300 survivors set sail in five barges.
In terrible weather, they tried to sail across the Gulf of Mexico, past the Mississippi,
Narvaez himself was never seen again,
We would know nothing of this story, but for the captain of one of the barges, a young Spanish gentleman called A lvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca,
He was coming out of this part of Florida,
The green arrows indicate the current and speed and, as you see, it gets pretty swift.
- Along the Mississippi delta.
- The arrows show the predominant direction?
The predominant direction of the current.
The predominant wind is from the southeast.
That's interesting.
"In the end," says Cabeza de Vaca,
"we commended ourselves to God and the dangers of the sea,
"And there was not a man among us who did not think that death was certain,
"None of us had any idea of havigation,
"For six weeks we were lost, "eating rotten maize, drinking sea water, which drove some men mad
"I was at the helm that night, I had prepared to die,
"And then, in the darkness, we heard breakers, "We were near land"
It was the 6th of November, 1528,
At dawn, they came inshore,
But the boat capsized in the surf,
Too weak to swim, some of the men were drowned
They found themselves on a windswept shore unseen before by white men,
Galveston Island, Texas,
How far up do you think they went?
You know, given how weak he was, I don't think he probably went much further than you're going.
0ne of them climbed an oak tree to see where they were,
- I can see it!
I can see the bay!
I think they guessed the island was about half a league wide.
Maybe a mile and a half or so. That would be about right, would it?
- At the widest point.
And then they could actually, on a good, clear day like today, see the mainland across the bay.
And you recognise that you're on an island.
But the island was inhabited by Karankawa Indians.
They were hunter gatherers and they only came here during the fall.
They usually left at the end of February and the beginning of March and would return to the mainland and...
But this was what you might call their winter residence, like the New Yorkers go to Florida.
"We had expected to be sacrificed," says Cabeza de Vaca,
"But when the Indians saw our misery they sat down with us and began to weep, too,
"Those uncivilised, savage men were sorry, for us,
"And they shared what little food they had"
You know, you look at all these great expeditions of the conquistadors and the terrible events that happened in the New World, Pizarro and everything else.
And here is a story where the man begins here on this spot
- to become the other, doesn't he?
And it's the Indians who give him the first clue to this transformation, isn't it?
They cry for him and he realises the common humanity, don't you think?
They saw people destitute, in pain.
They were moved by compassion to help them and aid them in the process and so they saved Cabeza de Vaca, to their own detriment.
It's...
- They were exterminated in the end. - They were.
The Karankawas began to die of European diseases that same winter,
They vanished for good in the course of the 18th century,
But they kept Cabeza de Vaca alive with the food of the island
That's razor sharp.
So there's an oyster bed running all the way down this little inlet?
I don't know how many people they were trying to feed, but I wouldn't starve.
The expedition had been scattered to the winds,
The men from another barge were slaughtered by Indians up the coast, one group reduced to eating their dead shipmates,
But Cabeza de Vaca survived on oysters and roots,
This plant...
This is a cattail.
And this is probably what he was speaking of when he said that he was breaking those nuts off to eat.
It is like a nut.
It was easy pickings.
They could just walk out and pick it up and there are acres and acres of oysters that are exposed at low tide.
But of the 300 men who left Florida, only four would survive,
And they took Cabeza de Vaca with them,
They had thought him a superior man, but with no skills, he was an extra mouth to feed and he became their slave,
He was brutally treated, but they kept him alive,
After five or six years of that life, Cabeza de Vaca decided he'd had enough.
It was time to escape.
Not out to sea, but into the interior.
The interior of Texas at that time was completely unknown to the outside world
But during those years, Cabeza de Vaca had got to know many of the nomadic tribes who lived inland
Some of them he describes for the first time,
Coahuiltecans, Tonkawas, Atakapan,
But that was not all, He'd also discovered that one of the coastal tribes had sheltered three other survivors of the shipwreck, who were still alive,
They met up and made their break for freedom,
Their plan was to walk 1,000 miles to Mexico City,
They couldn 't go south because of hostile tribes,
So they decided to walk to the Pacific, but which way?
It used to be thought that they took a northern route through New Mexico and A rizona, down into Spanish Mexico,
But there's another possibility - that they crossed the Rio Grande near the sea and turned west inside Mexico,
The clues are in Cabeza de Vaca's book, 0ne of the few copies to survive is in San Marcos, and there I met Don 0lsen,
So this is an original copy of Cabeza de Vaca's story?
Yes, it is.
And the page we're most interested in, in the research we did, is page 40.
There are four physical clues, all that happen on the same page here.
There's a mountain of seven leagues, which would be 20 or 21 miles long.
"Una sierra de sieta leguas." Yes.
And the stones there were like scoria of hierro.
- Iron slag. - Iron slag.
Down near the bottom of the page, he finds some trees.
Pines with pinones.
And there again you see the pinones.
And the words that really catch our eye down there are right there.
That means their shells were very thin.
So this is a very particular kind of pine tree.
A very particular kind.
The other two clues are much harder.
He says, "They gave us many small sacks of margarita and alcohol molido."
Now, those are minerals.
If you look closely, do you see what I see? That word is not margarita.
- The second R isn't the same as the first R.
It has a descender down to the left which prints very faintly.
You see it there?
If you look closely, you see it's actually margaxita with an X.
Margaxita.
What does that mean?
- What that means is iron pyrites.
- Iron pyrites.
So the Spaniards walked into a land rich in minerals, To follow them, we crossed the Rio Grande and entered the desolate landscape of horthern Mexico,
, searching for Cabeza de Vaca's route into unknown America, Just over there.
(READS SPANISH) "We marched along, mountain range seven leagues long."
They walked the whole length of this sierra in one day.
They were the first Europeans to walk across the continent,
They gave us the first account of the people here,
But it's never been traced on the ground
Maybe we can ask them about the pine trees.
Do you want to roll your window down?
(SPEAK SPANISH)
Much of his story, is still misunderstood because we don't know for sure what route he took,
We're looking for the pinones with very, very thin shells.
If we knew his route, then his account might begin to reveal a lost history, of these lands, And now, as then, local knowledge is all,
- The old man knows about them.
- (THEY SPEAK SPANISH)
- So the old man knew about them?
We're on the right track.
The old herder had sent us on to a dried-up river bed and there were the pine trees,
- So this is one of them?
It's amazing to think that paper shell pinon was only identified by science in 1979.
And how easy to imagine the Spaniards feasting on the kernels,
- There's still some on the floor.
It was the best food they'd had for days,
- This year is not... was not a good season.
When they're still green, you just grind them up, make a ball and eat them, If they're dry, eat them with the shells too,
(CRUNCHING)
You see how thin it is.
That's what Cabeza de Vaca's talking about.
That's what the Indians here used as food along with the nopal cacti that we passed on the way.
But to clinch his route, we needed to find his mountain of iron,
The locals sent us up a place called Mercado, the hill of wealth, 5,000... more than 5,000 feet up the mountain.
Cabeza de Vaca says the people here smelted metals,
They gave him a worked copper bell,
There are copper deposits here and there's also a huge quarry,
It's golden brown with iron ore, Strewn with pyrites and iron slag,
So this whole vast excavation here has been done for the iron?
Yes, they've dug out this, made the hole.
Then some rocks have fallen in from the sides.
(MICHAEL) Some of the other clues you might be able to help on, as a geologist.
They find something, which everybody argues over.
They call it alcohol molido, powdered alcohol, which some people say could be stibnite, lead sulphide.
There's also black manganese around the outside here.
It's called pyrolusite.
The Indians used it as paint.
And that's exactly what Cabeza de Vaca says,
"A black powder used by Indian women to paint their faces, "
0K.
Hey, we've got some manganese here.
So you think this could be it?
Well, it's the kind of manganese we call pyrolusite and it sure comes off black.
I left Monclova feeling sure Cabeza de Vaca had come this way,
He wasn't moving through the nomadic peoples of central Texas,
He was among the settled communities here in north Mexico,
People who lived in houses, worked metals and had long-distance trade,
The ancestors of today's people,
The next few weeks, he tells us, they walked 300 or 400 miles across dry plains into barren mountains,
They were heading northwards now, back up towards the Rio Grande, But they weren't wandering aimlessly,
They spoke the languages and moved from one community to another on ancient trails, which now crossed and recrossed a great river,
These trails are marked on US military, maps from the 1850s, 0ne of them was called the Great Comanche Trail,
Going back down into Mexico, it met the Rio Grande at the Grand Indian Crossing,
These trails can be thousands of years old, maybe even used by the first migrants over 12,000 years ago,
We took an expert guide with us, Linda Walker, and team archeologist Bob Mallouf.
And all along the trail, we found places where human beings had once lived
Cabeza de Vaca's journey had begun to reveal the vanished map of ancient America,
The sheltered part and it probably ran further out.
This is one of the better pictograph sites that we've come up to.
You can see that they're all over this panel.
(B0B) Those are beautiful pictographs.
Late prehistoric pictographs.
- What's late prehistoric?
- 500 AD to as late as 1550.
0n the basis of art size.
We could still make out the finger marks of the artists,
What are they depicting?
This looks like something with legs.
Uh, it...
They're difficult or impossible, as a rule, to interpret accurately, although a lot of people try. 0h.
So could any of these be religious in significance?
We can probably assume that they practised certain kinds of shamanistic religion.
Certainly with healers and this sort of thing.
This was the kind of religion that Cabeza de Vaca and his friends encountered along this route.
And they thought Cabeza de Vaca was a shaman.
What's the lifestyle of these people?
- Well, they're... - (LINDA) Hard.
There wouldn't have been great hospitality at the table in the evening.
(B0B) We have hard archaeological evidence that they would eat just about anything they could get their hands on.
Bob's hard evidence came from the ancient human excrement in the rubbish dumps on these camp sites,
When Cabeza de Vaca said they were eating worms and spiders, he wasn't telling lies,
The Spanish gentleman was tasting the life most humans had lived since the Stone Age,
That night we found a campsite overlooking the desert, , on the great prehistoric route into Central America,
The place was an abandoned Indian settlement,
We found grinding holes, just as Cabeza de Vaca describes,
These are probably 2,000... 3,000 BC to as late as 500 AD.
See they're very tapered... So you have a wooden pounder and pound the seeds or whatever you used inside.
Seeds, mesquite beans, things like that they would ground.
They would ground up in these and powder them to make meal.
- These are good examples.
Cabeza de Vaca says these holes were used to grind mesquite beans to make the hallucinogens for the Indian ceremonies,
He also describes the way they cooked food
(LINDA) Look at that.
Boiling the water with hot stones from the fire,
That is hot.
I've never seen that done.
- 0oh.
- There we go.
So they do this because they don't have ceramics.
They don't have...
They can't put a pot on the fire to heat water.
Probably because they moved about frequently.
Pottery is not very conducive to a lot of movement in this country especially, because it's so rocky and it's easily broken.
- So where are the teabags?
- Come on.
- English breakfast or Earl Grey?
(LINDA) You guys are supposed to be the experts on this, Michael.
As Cabeza de Vaca said, "How diverse and strange are human beings and their ways, "
The four men had now reached the very, middle of the continent, But did they still feel like conquistadors?
Did Cabeza de Vaca, the gentleman?
He had the chance to see this world before it was destroyed by the conquistadors and exploiters who followed But how much he leaves unsaid
(LINDA) Some burritos?
(MICHAEL) Yeah, that'd be great, thanks.
0ne thing that I keep wondering about as we're travelling in the footsteps of Cabeza de Vaca is that he's away for seven or eight years...
You've got some?
It was probably the first infusion of Spanish blood into America.
You can bet he wouldn't mention it, though.
It would have caused him problems with the Church probably.
He had to write this to the audience that were now feeding him, which was Spain.
And he doesn't want them to think that he just ditched Spanish values and went native.
And went, "These values that I was raised with I've now decided are suspect."
No, I don't think he could do that, but I concur with you.
I think there was an unwritten story there.
And so they continued, following the sun, across the ridges of the Sierra Madre,
"Though we could speak six Indian languages," says Cabeza de Vaca, "we found 1,000 differences in their ways of speech,
"But we were always understood and kept our authority with the Indians,
"Though still naked, shedding our skin twice a year like snakes, "
(LINDA) This is a tenaha.
This would hold water year round.
It can be anywhere as deep as ten feet, or as shallow as a foot and a half, but there's always water there.
- (MICHAEL) And it's good water?
- Good water.
(TRADITl0NAL F0LK MUSIC PLAYS) And we finally reached the little town of San Carlos,
Enrique.
We finally made it.
- Do you want a beer?
- I'd love one.
(SINGS IN SPANISH)
- A thrill.
You know what?
It was sure fun.
It had been fun, but it had also told us more about Cabeza de Vaca and the man he was becoming,
Something has happened to him.
He has been transformed somehow.
He is no long either an Indian and he is no longer a Spaniard and a Christian.
He is a new man.
You speak of him as a man situated in between those two cultures.
I suppose, in a sense, he's the first modern man, in a way.
Do you think?
learned something that very few Spaniards knew, that the Indians were human beings.
And many in Spain didn't want human beings at that time.
They wanted slaves.
Everywhere on their journey now, they were treated as people with powers, people who could heal,
To we modern people, this is the least believable part of his story,
And even in his day, he was accused of fantasising, And worse, claiming supernatural powers,
"The Indian healers do their cures like this," he says, "By blowing on the sick person and then using their hands to cast the illness out,
"We did the same, but with the sign of the cross, praying to God to make them better, " And he did
(W0MAN SPEAKS SPANISH)
(TRANSLAT0R) This is the sacred heart of Jesus.
He appears to me when I cure the sick.
0h, and this, this is my protection against the evil spirits who can harm me.
Absolutely wonderful mixture of Christian symbols and yet the way of working with them is much more traditional and Mexican.
It touches back to what was the religion of the whole of the Americas in ancient times, this sort of shamanistic religion.
In a sense, Cabeza de Vaca was the first person to try and cross the boundary between the two and use them both.
"It pleased God to give them health," says Cabeza de Vaca, as a 16th-century, man would
And however we might explain it, thousands of Indians clung to them now, asking for their blessings, walking with them through the wilderness,
"We saw many towns now," says Cabeza de Vaca, "built by civilised people,"
They were near the ruined city of Casas Grandes,
This astonishing place was once a centre of the shell trade,
The archaeologists found a ton and a half of shells in these warehouses.
Shells for grinding up, for use as decoration on the face of the walls.
Shells for personal adornment, necklaces, bracelets.
Shells like the pink spondylos, which was used for religious rituals all the way along the Pacific coast down to South America.
This place was abandoned a century before Cabeza de Vaca's day.
But the commerce and the trade routes on which it was carried still continued.
Winter was coming on now as they climbed out of the plains,
Their last hurdle, the immense fissured landscape around Copper Canyon,
0ne of the biggest native groups in the Americas still lives here, the Tarahumara,
"The people here are the most open and intelligent folk I met, " says Cabeza de Vaca,
"Their women more modestly and better dressed than in any other part of the Indies we'd seen, "
The Tarahumara are descendents of the peoples who once spread all over the high plains of horthern Mexico,
They have borrowed from the Europeans only a handful of useful things - the violin, the goat, the apple tree and the metal ploughshare,
A plow...
There are no roads through their lands, You still have to go on foot,
They call themselves the people who walk straight, And they mean in their hearts, as well as with their feet,
By now Cabeza de Vaca had seen the first signs of the Spanish presence, an Indian wearing a sword hilt as an amulet,
His world was not far off,
This is where we'll be sleeping tonight.
And jolly comfy it looks, too.
He knew now he must leave the Indian world
But however much he wanted to, he also knew that what he was leaving behind had true worth,
Reading his account, I think that he remained a Christian gentleman,
He still believed in the civilising mission of Spain, but he was no longer a conquistador,
If you had to explain to somebody what it is about this life that is so good, what would the things be that they think are so valuable?
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
He had understood that the peoples of the Americas were human, too,
As the Tarahumara would put it, Cabeza de Vaca had learned to walk straight,
He said, "What's good about life is that there's goat shit.
I said, "Why do you make tesguino?" He says, "To have a fiesta."
So that you can dance this special dance they do all night, so that God will bring water.
"Why do you need water?" He says, "So that the corn... will be born."
There's the circle. If we kept asking, it would go round.
- (SPEAKS TARAHUMARA DIALECT)
(B0B) They don't walk straight any more.
So people like me, we don't walk straight any more?
He says, "Not hardly at all.
Sorry."
But how would Cabeza de Vaca use his knowledge on his return?
The odyssey of Cabeza de Vaca was drawing to its close,
That winter they came down forested canyons towards the Pacific,
After more than 2,000 miles, he was about to reenter the world he'd once known,
"We came down into a wonderful landscape, " he says, "fertile with rivers, forests and fields,
"Nowhere in the world, in our eyes, could be so rich and beautiful,
(CALLS 0UT IN SPANISH)
Cabeza de Vaca ran into Spanish slave hunters,
It's a moment which has been portrayed in novels and films,
And so Cabeza de Vaca met his old self the man he'd been all those years before,
They threatened to enslave his Indian companions and to kill him, but he stood his ground and forced them to let him and his Indians go,
And finally, nearly ten years after he left Cuba, he walked like a ghost into the town of Culiacan, to the astonishment of the local Spanish colonists,
They had been the first people to walk across the continent,
They'd seen things no outsider had ever seen,
But there's no happy ending to his story,
When he got back to Spain, he argued for benevolent rule in the Americas,
But he was ruined by his enemies and he died a pauper, His only legacy, the book of his adventures,
While he'd been lost, the world had changed as never before,
The conquistadors had carried their swords from Florida to Chile,
Their bravery, and their greed had led them to Lake Titicaca and to the heights of Machu Picchu,
And the cost?
Ancient civilisations overthrown,
Tens of millions dead from European violence and disease, And the plundering of the natural world of the Americas,
(M0NKS CHANTING)
Back in Spain, these events woke the conscience of the age and people now began to question the justice of conquest,
All the great civilisations had treated people not of their own colour or creed as alien,
But now, in Catholic Spain, these assumptions were questioned Did the Indians have human rights?
What does it mean to be human?
This is where the debate was held.
It's quite a moment in the history of the world.
The first time that principles of universal human rights and global justice were worked out took place here.
"How can it be doubted that they have been justly conquered "by our most humane nation, which excels in every kind of virtue?"
Las Casas spoke second.
Staggered in, an enormous pile of documentation, 40 years of research.
The King's counsellors' jaws must have dropped.
Must have thought he was going to talk for days and he did.
He talked for five days.
"There's no nation on earth," he said, "no matter how savage, cannot attain humane civilisation.
"All the peoples of the world are human beings.
"And the definition of a human being "is that we are all rational things.
"We share the same faculties of will and capacities and understanding.
"We all take pleasure in goodness.
"The war against the natives of the New World is wrong "because it is unjust to wage war against our fellow humans.
"And all the peoples of the world are human."
(BELL RINGS)
The King listened He ordered a stop to the conquests while the issue was debated further,
But he couldn 't stop history, 0n the ground, the conquests continued, driven, as ever, by the lust for gold
And what of the conquistadors themselves, the men who won the New World
What did they think, looking back?
He died in...
Stuart Sterling's ancestor was one of them,
He fought in the battles in Peru, saw Atahualpa dead, married an Inca princess, But he had blood on his hands,
He wrote this extraordinary document, which he addressed to King Philip II.
0n his deathbed, aged 78, he addressed to the King a remarkable confession,
"I, Captain Mancio Seirra de Leguizamo, make this my last will and testament.
"Firstly, for the peace of my soul, I declare for many years now "I have wanted to speak to His Catholic Majesty, to King Philip.
"I wish Your Majesty to understand the motive that moves me to say this
"is the peace of my conscience, because of the guilt I share.
"And so I have unburdened my conscience.
"There is nothing more I can do to alleviate these injustices, other than by these words,
"for I'm the last to die of the conquistadors."
In the winter of 1527, a boat arrived at a lonely island off the Pacific shore of South America,
It had come to rescue a ragged band of desperadoes who'd been searching the unknown for lands of gold
Their leader was an old conquistador called Francisco Pizarro,
Pizarro still believes that somewhere to the south there's an undiscovered world.
But his men now have had enough of his promises.
They just want to get out.
"He's a butcher, a savage!
Get us off this hellish beach!"
Then Pizarro gets up and he takes his sword and... draws a line in the sand.
"Friends and comrades," he said, "this side of the line is danger, death, hunger, abandonment.
"This side of the line, comfort and safety.
"That side of the line, go back to Panama and you'll be poor.
"Cross over this side and you'll be rich beyond your wildest dreams."
13 of them cross over - the glorious 13, they called them.
Unlike the Europeans, the Incas still lived in sacred time,
For them, the sun was god and every, day they worshipped his first appearance from the bitter Andean night,
"And we thought this was the whole world," said one of them,
"For we knew of ho other,"
Until the Spanish came,
In 1532, Pizarro returned to Peru with a small private army,
With him were the survivors from his island, his hometown friends and four of his brothers, as close-knit as a Mafia clan,
Ahead of them lay a vast empire and the great Inca himself Atahualpa,
In November 1533, after months of trekking south,
Pizarro reached the foot of the Andes,
We set out to follow in his footsteps,
(HE GREETS HER IN SPANISH)
At first, the local people fed the strangers,
Pizarro himself slept in their houses,
I'll be reasonably comfortable!
I shouldn't have imagined a mattress.
He taught Spanish to two Indians so he could converse in Quechua, the Inca language,
The Spanish gathered their first impressions of this great state and its people,
"How rational the Indians are," said P izarro's secretary,
"The people seem very, obedient to their rulers, "
Here, the Spaniards tasted potatoes for the first time,
Along with more exotic dishesl
There's an old story that in ancient Inca times, there was a period of famine.
The people were starving.
They discovered this furry rodent among the rocks.
It was good to eat and it saved them.
They only eat it for special festivals - religious festivals and so on.
They're doing it today because they've got a foreign guest.
Next day, we loaded up to follow Pizarro into the Andes,
It's an unbelievable thought - Pizarro had 62 horse and 102 foot plus some native allies from further up the coast.
He's entering an empire of five or ten million!
Maybe if he knew, he would go back!
He hadn't seen the Inca army, had he?
He's a canny character, Pizarro.
Illiterate, middle-aged, tough as old boots.
And very, very clever.
The roads of the Inca Empire stretched 3,000 miles, from Chile to Ecuador,
And this one led to the camp of the Inca himself at the town of Cajamarca,
"We followed a narrow steep path," the Spanish said, "straight up to the mountain peaks,"
It's still there, with its Inca steps,
Look at this!
Is this Inca, Ricardo?
Nobody but the Incas made this kind of work.
Look.
I've got the account of Pizarro's secretary of their journey up this pass. He says how steep the pass was.
When they got to the top, it was defended by a fortress surrounded by stone walls, built on a hill with very steep rocks on either side.
That's it!
We're on his tracks!
- Almost nobody knows this place in Peru.
It's amazing.
The Spaniards were seeing things no outsider had ever seen,
The last moments of a world untouched since the dawn of history,
After five days' march over the mountains,
Pizarro came out above the town of Cajamarca,
The campfires of the enemy that night were a terrifying sight, the Spanish said.
"Like a brilliantly star-studded sky."
Atahualpa's army, they reckoned, was 30,000 strong,
The Spaniards were on edge now,
Why had they been allowed to come on unopposed
Were they walking into a trap?
Pizarro's secretary, tells the tale,
"Few of us slept that night.
We just talked about what we should do.
"All were full of fear, for we were so few, and so deep into the land.
"And with no hope of rescue."
The Inca, Atahualpa, was taking the waters at the hot springs outside the town, And it was here that the two worlds first met,
The Spanish advance party told A tahualpa that Pizarro loved him dearly and would fight for him against his enemies,
"And he smiled," said the Spanish,
"as if he didn 't think much of us,"
Atahualpa told them they could stay in the town,
0minously, when the Spanish entered the town, they found it empty,
They occupied a building on the square and waited to see what the Inca would do,
Atahualpa's spies had been watching them all the way,
His chief spy, Apu, reported back,
We know, from several chroniclers, what Apu reported.
He reported to his boss the following.
- 0ne, they are not gods.
- Not gods?
- The Inca knew that.
- Doesn't mean the people knew that.
0K? "I have seen them," said Apu, "I have seen how they get tired."
0r sick. And a few of them died.
They don't get sick.
But they decided a plan.
They said let's kill them all except three of them, who are going to be castrated.
The horse-breaker,
- the iron man...
- The blacksmith?
The guy who does the horseshoes and the weaponry.
And the barber.
The horse-breaker and the other one, of course, to establish the cavalry of Atahualpa.
But the barber because, Apu said, "He knows something.
"I have seen the people lining up in front of his tent.
"They're tired, really messed up.
"And when they come out, I have seen them rejuvenated, "fresh, health, "and with their skin fresh as a baby's butt."
Atahualpa wanted to have Pizarro for lunch.
But Pizarro had him for breakfast!
Down in the square, as the hours passed, the Spanish still waited
"And I tell you," said one of them, "we were wetting ourselves in terror,"
At last, Atahualpa entered the square on the shoulders of his courtiers,
It's funny what people remember at such moments of high tension,
The Spanish remembered the lilting song with which the people welcomed him,
It's still sung today at festivals in the Andes,
(RHYTHMIC CHANT)
Pizarro watched with his captains and his priest, Valverde,
Atahualpa took his seat in the middle of the square,
Valverde stepped forward with a cross and a prayer book and made a speech about Christ and the Pope.
He called upon the Inca to abandon his false religion and embrace Christ.
"I follow my religion," said Atahualpa.
"The undying sun and the ancient gods of the Incas.
"What is your authority for your religion?" he said.
The priest held up his book.
"Give it to me," said Atahualpa,
"so I may see if it speaks to me."
He turned the pages carefully and then looked up.
"Why does it say nothing to me?" he said, and he threw the book on the floor.
That was what Pizarro had been waiting for.
It was the moment on which his whole career had converged.
It gave him his pretext for war and he gave the order to attack.
From the porticos all around this square the Spanish came out and opened fire on the masses of people crowded here.
Inca sticks and fans were no match for Spanish guns and steel,
Some said 6,000 people died that night,
As the rain fell, the square ran red with blood
But Atahualpa was captured alive,
They took him in chains to a prison close-by,
It's still there,
And now Atahualpa made an astonishing offer - to ransom himself
If they would set him free, he would fill the room with gold
0n his desert island, had P izarro ever imagined this?
In his wildest dreams? The story's still told and retold across the Andes,
But there are other Inca versions of the story, 0ne of them a unique manuscript discovered only in the 20th century,
(MAN) Thank you very much.
This is it, the famous "Nueva Cronica y Buen Gobierno."
It's really exciting to be facing this document, a document which is unique.
Because here, you not only see things that are valuable for the past, but also things that will help you to understand the present.
The author, Guaman Poma, was a man of Inca descent,
(0SSl0) This is the point of view of a vanquished.
0f one of those Indians who were conquered by the Spanish people.
He's always insisted that the real owners of the Indian territories are the Indians and the Spaniards are the owners of Spain.
And each one in their own realm is perfect.
0rder is perfect.
But if the Spanish come here and pretend to be the owners, then that is representing the disorder of the world.
The world is upside down.
- (W00D) The world is upside down?
To gather the gold, Atahualpa ordered his people to allow the Spanish to travel freely through his empire,
And the Spaniards set out on the greatest plundering raid in history,
So why did A tahualpa do it?
According to Guaman Poma, the Inca had never seen the strangers as a threat, Now, he thought, if he delivered the gold as promised,
Pizarro would simply go away,
"At that time," says Guaman Poma, "we Indians lost all sense of direction, We forgot our gods "and lost the authority of our rulers,"
So Pizarro's men stripped the gold off the greatest shrines in the Americas,
Atahualpa filled his ransom room with seven tonnes of it, one of the greatest treasures in all of history,
He'd kept his word But what would P izarro do?
Pizarro put Atahualpa on trial for treason, The jury, - the Pizarro brothers and their friends,
The verdict - "The Inca must die,"
"It was the most despicable thing we ever did in the Americas, " said one conquistador,
In the Andes, the people have never forgotten,
(HE SPEAKS QUECHUA)
Corazon?
The heart of a puma, si?
They killed him like a llama.
For the Incas, these events were almost beyond belief
This was a "Pachacuti" - the world turned upside down,
Pizarro now marched his army in triumph south, on the Inca royal road, a thousand miles to the capital of the Inca Empire, Cuzco,
"0n November 15th, 1533,
"we Spaniards reached Cuzco,
"It was a wondrous thing to behold
"No prize ever equalled this,
"The streets were grand, "the palaces of finely-jointed stone blocks of great antiquity, "
It was the richest town in all the Indies, founded by the first Inca and refounded in 1533 by Francisco Pizarro,
And so, at last, Pizarro looked down on his prize,
The city of the Incas, with its great ceremonial square and the huge palaces of the Inca royal clans,
It was a turning point in the history, of the world
The Inca believed this place was the navel of the earth.
It was the sacred centre of the last of the civilisations to arise independently on the planet.
The end of sacred time.
The triumph of profane time.
For Pizarro's expedition was a profit - making venture backed by the bankers of Europe,
From now on, across the Atlantic, the talk was of hothing but Peru and gold
Europe was amazed Spaniards flooded into Peru on a gold rush,
The Pizarro brothers flaunted their new-found fortunes,
For them, these were days of wonder as they tightened their grip on the people and the riches of P eru,
To win hearts and minds, the Pizarros appointed a puppet king, Atahualpa's half-brother Manco,
But the Spaniards treated him with contempt,
To the Incas' horror, Gonzalo Pizarro raped Manco's wife and took her for himself
Word soon spread of a war of liberation,
Manco summoned his leaders to a secret meeting,
Perhaps it took place in the Inca sun temple which still stands today inside a Cuzco church,
Manco's words were recorded by his son Tito Cusi,
"I've summoned you all here," said Manco, "because we all know now clearly who these foreigners really are.
"They're not worthy people sent by God, "but children of the devil.
"We've endured a thousand insults, they treat us like dogs "while swearing to be our friends.
"Now I want you to send your messengers throughout the whole country.
"Summon all your forces to gather here in Cuzco in 20 days' time "to attack them.
"Make sure the bearded ones hear nothing about this "and we'll kill every last one of them.
"Then, perhaps, we may waken from this nightmare."
Manco's plan was a concerted attack all over Peru, Above Cuzco, a vast Inca army gathered in the hills,
The Spaniards were surrounded Cut off in Lima, Francisco Pizarro sent frantic pleas to Mexico for help,
Three relief columns were wiped out by Manco's armies, Here in Cuzco,
Spanish survival hung on whether they could take the Inca fortress which controlled the city at Sacsayhuaman,
The Spaniards were outnumbered and, at times, outfought,
Juan Pizarro was killed But in the end, the Incas were outgunned
The last battle for these walls was fought with a desperate heroism by the Inca warriors.
Like the Aztec battle for Mexico City, it recalls the great classical epics like the "Iliad", the siege of Troy.
"And so our encirclement was broken," says Guaman Poma,
"The Spaniards had bought themselves a breathing space, "
The Pizarros now took savage reprisals against the civilian population, the women and children who helped Manco's army,
A massive exodus followed as those who could fled north into the Sacred Valley,
The Sacred Valley was the Inca heartland
Here they built their finest palaces with huge terraces to grow maize and coca leaves,
Here, Manco and his high priest could call on the help of the ancestors,
At Machu Picchu, the mummies of the dead Incas could be brought out of their womb-like chambers to greet the sun,
Their dead eyes regaled as in life with the vistas of the sacred peaks,
- ~Buenos dias!
According to Guaman Poma, Manco built new terraces and houses here to feed and shelter the influx of troops and refugees,
You can still see them at 0llantaytambo, with its Inca housing plots and water channels,
The Incas boasted that Manco had made this the strongest fortress in all Peru,
And it was here that the Pizarros launched their next attack,
They fought their way through the narrow lanes of the town,
Then they attacked the fortress which towers above,
The Spaniards now sent their force of commandos up to try and seize the rocks above the fortress.
Hernando Pizarro led the assault up these steps while the Incas rained down missiles, spurred on by Manco, who rode the terraces above on a Spanish horse,
"Suddenly, the Indians hit us from every, side,
"To hear the roar of their army,
"it was as if the mountain was about to crash on top of us, "
For the first time, the Spanish had been beaten in a pitched battle,
"0ne more day and we would have killed them all, " said Tito Cusi,
"My father's men laughed heartily at the Spanish rout "and how we celebrated our victory,"
Manco planned to make a new Cuzco here in the Sacred Valley,
He even built a great council chamber, carved with the royal pumas,
"By such monuments, he hoped to be remembered always, " said Guaman Poma,
But Manco knew that Spanish colonists were pouring into Peru every, month,
Within a year, Manco realised he would have to pull right out of Spanish reach, to the jungles the far side of the Andes,
Peru would be partitioned
It must have been a heartbreaking moment for the young Inca,
When Manco had decided to retreat up the valley into the jungles of Vilcabamba he made a speech to his loyal followers.
A moving speech, too, a little like Bonnie Prince Charlie going over the sea to Skye.
He asked them to remember his ancestors, the Incas of the past, had been good rulers, had cared for the people and provided for them.
"Don't forget that," he said.
"Don't let your children forget it."
Then he said these extraordinary words which are all the more striking now.
"I know," he said, "that one day, in the future, "the time will come when they will force us to worship their gods.
"And when that day comes, "do what you have to do in front of them, but in private don't forget our ceremonies "and our gods.
"And if they try to force you to destroy our shrines, "only reveal what you have to and keep the rest hidden in your hearts."
So the Inca Empire was to be divided
Manco's court and his army began their long march over the Andes, demolishing the road behind them as they went, Nearly 13,000 feet.
Good Lord!
No wonder my hands are freezing cold!
But even now, the Incas still dreamed that one day they might return,
0n the far side of the mountains, Manco hoped to organise a new resistance, As Manco put it, "To free the land of our forefathers,"
Manco destroyed the rope bridge here, The river was to be the boundary, between the two worlds,
But no one crossed the Pizarros,
With him, Gonzalo took 300 of the toughest conquistadors, more than his brother had led to Cajamarca,
We set out to follow him,
I've now got fleas. You may wonder why I'm scratching my hands.
I've been bitten by the dreaded "puma wacachi" - which is the fly that makes even the puma cry!
- It's got me all over. It's true!
- Puma wacachi!
Me wacachi!
The first stage of our trek in Pizarro's footsteps took us across bleak uplands over the last of the high passes towards Amazonia,
Manco had retired to the farthest corner of the Inca world to create his new kingdom,
(MEN ENC0URAGE H0RSES)
- Is this the Pass Colpa?
- Yes, this is Colpa Pasa.
- The Colpa Pasa?
- What does that mean?
- That's the highest point on the trail.
I'll catch you up in a minute.
The Colpa Pass, the high pass.
About 12,400 feet.
This is the last of the passes before the road goes down and down and down towards the headwaters of the Amazon and down into Amazonia itself.
When the Inca resistance headed this way, they were saying goodbye to their old homeland.
According to Guaman Poma, Manco had pushed new roads into the interior, And on the second day, we found them,
- This looks like Inca steps, yeah?
- Yes, it is Inca steps.
They're quite well preserved up here.
Pizarro now scented blood
"We cannot fail to get Manco now," he said, "dead or alive,"
But Pizarro was too confident and he fell into Manco's trap,
(SPEAKS QUECHUA)
Don Juvenal told us how the Incas had rolled stones down on the Spaniards,
There are still piles of rocks up there,
36 conquistadors were killed
Gonzalo was forced to retreat and wait for reinforcements before he dared push on,
And Manco taunted him,
"I am Manco Inca,
"We have killed 2,000 Spaniards and we will kill you too, and free our country, "
The following day, we came down through the clouds into sodden rainforests,
In places, landslides had taken the path away,
Such conditions must have sapped the morale even of P izarro's hardened conquistadors,
we came in sight of Manco's lost city,
- This is Espiritu Pampa?
- Espiritu Pampa.
There it is, the Lost Valley of the Incas.
The site of their last city.
It's so secluded, so hidden, you can understand why it was never discovered until the 20th century.
You can understand too why the last of the Incas thought they might be safe here, hidden away from the rest of the world.
Pizarro had had to fight his way this far, But when he got here, the city was empty,
Manco had disappeared into the jungle,
This is la plaza principal, Don Juvenal?
Si, plaza principal.
(D0N JUVENAL SPEAKS QUECHUA)
Today, Manco's city lies scattered over a square mile of forest, so choked with vegetation it takes time to make out the shapes of the buildings,
It's all on such a huge scale.
This is the terracing of the great plaza in the middle of the city on which stood the temple.
They brought it all here to try to rebuild their world in the jungle.
Gonzalo searched these forests for two months till sickness and starvation forced him to retreat,
By his fingernails, Manco had survived
In his fury Pizarro took revenge,
He ordered Manco's wife shot with arrows and floated her down the river in a basket to be found by the Incas,
Manco was grief-stricken for he had loved her very, much,
Meanwhile, Pizarro's private empire began to fall apart,
Like all Mafia families, the Pizarros had made bitter enemies,
In a scene from "The Godfather", Francisco, the discoverer and conqueror of P eru, was murdered by the son of his first business partner,
Manco, meanwhile, had made his new capital at a place called Vitcos,
There's the Vilcabamba river.
The Spanish described the place as being on a high mountain with wonderful views over the province of Vilcabamba.
0n top, they say, was a substantial flat area where majestic and sumptuous buildings had been erected with great skill and art.
You can see their ruins even from this distance.
Manco held court here for seven years,
The Spaniards were now fighting among themselves and he sheltered enemies of the Pizarros,
But there was a price on the Inca's head, and in the end they got him,
This is all that remains of Manco's palace.
Here's the finely-sculpted lintels that the Spaniards mentioned.
And here's the plaza where it all happened.
Manco was about to play a game of quoits with horseshoes with his Spanish guests, a game he liked.
His son Tito Cusi tells the story.
"My father was about to throw," he said, "when one of the Spaniards stabbed him in the back.
"He tried to defend himself, but there were seven of them and he was unarmed.
"They stabbed him and stabbed him.
I wanted to defend him," Tito says, "but I was only nine years old.
"They turned on me and I was terrified and ran off into the bushes.
"Though I was wounded in the leg, I escaped.
"But my father was killed."
Manco had been the one Inca who offered hope of long-term resistance.
So the Inca Empire ended.
The political order was destroyed.
But things exist at different levels in history.
And empires are really just on the surface of history.
Up here in the Andes, the Inca people survive and the beliefs survive, just as Manco Inca had said.
The people themselves did not forget.
Nearly 500 years on, the people of the Andes still revere the ancestral spirits of the Incas,
Every June, they go up in their thousands onto the glaciers of the Sacred Mountains,
Just before dawn, at a breathless 16,000 feet, they worship the ice of Qoyllur Riti, the Lord of the Snow Star,
And afterwards, like their Inca ancestors, the people greet the rising sun,
And then they sing the lilting song they sang to Atahualpa all those years ago,
"When the last Inca is dead," said old Francisco Pizarro, "the people will weary, of resistance "and take our part,"
"In the beginning," said the Aztecs, "the white men came in one boat,"
Nearly 500 years ago,
Spanish adventurers landed on a small island off the coast of Mexico,
It was the first contact between the civilisations of the old world and the new,
The prelude to one of the greatest events in history,
It's a story of almost incredible endurance, heroism, greed and brutality.
And all the more poignant today as we see its long-term effects unfolding across the globe.
It's known still in the Americas as the conquest, the "Conquista".
And the larger-than-life men who achieved it are the conquerors, the "Conquistadors".
"Most mighty prince," wrote Hernan Cortes to the King of Spain,
"Let me begin at the beginning, We sailed our ships to the land called Yucatan, "
Cortes was a poor boy from a small town, trained in law, not war, But he had dreams,
A self-made man, he'd financed his own expedition - 11 ships, 500 soldiers,
Like Columbus, he didn 't know what lay ahead
He thought the land they could see beyond Cuba was just islands, through which they could sail to China,
It was April 1519,
Gracias!
It's hard for us to imagine the shock of the new for people of the 16th century,
For us, it would be like landing on another planet,
To discover that the New World also had great civilisations, with law, writing and architecture, this was a revelation,
"What rational beings live here?" Wrote Cortes,
"This is the best and richest land that ever there was, "
The awe-struck conquistadors christened one place "El Gran Cairo",
Cortes headed west to the Tabasco river, the frontier of the Mayan and the Aztec-speaking worlds,
Still perhaps unsure of his next move, he landed in Frontera,
The key to any close encounter is language, But Cortes couldn 't talk to the Aztecs,
He'd already found a Spanish sailor who spoke Mayan,
Then, here in Frontera, he had his lucky break,
Cortes was given a slave girl by a local chief Her name was Malinali, but here in Mexico everyone calls her "Malinche",
Malinche spoke Mayan and Nahuatl, the Aztec language, Through her, he could talk to them,
(TRANSLATl0N) Malinche was treated well by the Spanish.
Especially by Cortes.
Some say she fell hopelessly in love with him.
- Afrodisiaco, #si?
- Si.
Yes, some say she was dazzled by the power of Cortes.
And how she's paid for itl "Traitor, whore, goddess of death,"
For nearly 500 years, Mexicans have argued about Malinche and her relationship with Cortes, But Malinche was the one who would lead Cortes to his destiny,
Cortes sails on up the coast, Malinche at his side,
He keeps asking about gold And everywhere they tell him of a mysterious empire in the interior,
A land called Mexico,
He anchors at an island off the coast, "The Isle of Sacrifices", , just off the modern port of Vera Cruz,
And it was here that Cortes had his first encounter with the Aztecs,
In his letters, you can still feel his sense of wonder,
Since then, the tale has become a myth, It's even immortalised in the movies,
0n Easter Saturday 1519, a magnificent embassy arrived from the ruler of Mexico,
Even more strange, they seemed to have been expecting Cortes,
Dona Marina, find out who honours us in this royal manner.
(THEY SPEAK NAHUATL)
Malinche translates their Nahuatl,
Tell the royal ambassador I am pleased to welcome him to my camp.
To his amazement, the Aztecs offer him wonderful gifts of gold
Then came the crucial moment in the conversation.
"Do you have more gold?" says Cortes.
"Because we suffer from a disease of the heart that can only be cured by gold."
"Yes, we do," said the ambassador.
There could hardly have been a more dangerous admission.
Cortes now gave the Aztecs a show of his power,
He fired his guns, rode his horses down the shore,
The Aztecs were stunned They'd never seen such things before,
Their ambassador had his artists paint them, as we would take photographs,
"The strangers," he said, "have sticks which spurt fire,
"They ride deer, high as a house, which snort and foam, "
Cortes was invited to make a camp, He built a base here at Villa Rica,
You can see it all from here.
The little bay, the little headland where they built their fort.
Tiny, isn't it? Just a first enclave in the New World.
But it all started from here.
And perhaps it was only now that Cortes dreamed up the plan to go to the city of the Aztecs,
Could he somehow get them to bow to Spain?
Those nights by the sea, the locals told him of what lay ahead
How the Aztec empire was built on fear and tribute,
A tribute not only of things, but of people, 0f human hearts,
The name of the Aztec ruler was Montezuma,
But Montezuma was haunted by a prophecy, a legend of an exiled god who one day would return to reclaim his throne,
So the Aztec spies urgently looked for signs,
The strangers' white food Was it food of the gods?
Their pale faces, could they be divine?
It sounds incredible, and it probably sounded incredible to the Spanish, but Aztec gods weren't like Christian ones.
They were more like the gods of the ancient Greeks, capricious, wilful, mercurial, cruel.
And the most enigmatic of them all was Quetzalcoatl.
And according to the legend, when Quetzalcoatl was expelled from Mexico, he promised that one day he would return and regain his kingdom.
That he'd come back across that sea out to the east, back here, with his chalky white face and his beard in the Aztec year 1-Reed.
By an amazing chance, 52 to 1 chance this was that year!
And for the Aztecs, nothing happened by chance,
He acts fast, Kills the ringleader, Then, so no one can get away, he decides to pull his ships up on the beach and scupper them,
It's a gambler's throw, isn't it, destroying your own ships!
They won't talk about going home any more.
Typical piece of Cortes.
He knows what he needs to know about the Aztecs.
But to persuade his men into the interior, he needs to hitch them to his dreams.
To leave them, as he put it, with nothing to rely on but their own hands and the assurance that they must either conquer or die.
The hesitation was over, Cortes heads inland with some native allies from the coast who were keen to throw off the Aztec yoke,
He took a back road towards Montezuma's capital, Tenochtitlan, hoping along the way to find friends among Montezuma's enemies,
The towns they came through are still here - Coatapec, Xico,
"Every place we passed through," says the conquistador Bernal Diaz, "we saw altars for human sacrifice, By some, there were thousands of skulls, "
The Christian in Cortes was revolted
Here in Xico, he told the people they must give up their idols,
Speaking in Nahuatl, the Aztec language,
Malinche gave a potted history of Christianity.
Then she explained to the people the pope gave the King of Spain authority over their lands in the name of God.
The Spaniards were still trying to make sense of confusing signs,
The stench oo blood mingled with the scent of flowers,
Familiar European categories of life and death, nurture and feeding, were upside - down,
To quench their thirst, the Spaniards were given juice bled from the fleshy white heart of the Mage cactus,
Wow! It's absolutely beautiful.
0nly to learn this was the drink given to sacrificial victims to dull the senses of those who were about to die,
"was prepared for the eagle warriors who feasted on the flesh of their enemies, "
Whilst human sacrifice is long gone, chocolate is still drunk here at religious feasts,
(W0MAN SPEAKS NAHUATL)
That's "Buenas tardes"?
How do you say "Gracias"?
(SHE TRANSLATES T0 NAHUATL)
And with the language, hints of Aztec attitudes to love and sex,
For all their obsession with death, the Aztecs still loved life,
(IN NAHUATL) We'd better not... (HE REPEATS HER W0RDS)
I can't tell you what that means!
Cortes pushed on, And now we had to follow him on foot,
"Ahead of us, " says Cortes, "we saw a great range oo beautiful mountains, "the peaks so white we think they must be covered with snow, "
With him, Cortes had 300 conquistadors, 40 of them crossbowmen, 20 musketeers,
There were several hundred Indians, and Cuban servants, And, of course, his precious horses - 15 of them,
After a summer on the Caribbean coast, the Spaniards were in for a shock,
0ne of the conquistadors, Bernal Diaz, said when they came into the mountains, it rained and rained.
The path turned into torrents.
All they had was their cotton armour for the tropics.
They were unprepared for the change of temperature, going up 11,000 feet.
Soaking wet and freezing cold, some of their Indian servants died.
So far as we know, Cortes had no military, training, But he never lost the respect of those who marched with him,
The thing you have to remember about the conquistadors is that, putting themselves through this, they were all volunteers.
They were in it not for religion but a share of the profits.
They were free men.
They acknowledged their leader's authority but he had to pay attention to and respect them.
And they called each other "compadre".
They're all in it together.
- Is that the path up here?
- Eh?
- That's the path, is it?
That little path up to the top,
Cortes called it "Nombre de Dios" - "The name of God."
(RAIN DR0WNS 0UT W0RDS) 13,000 feet!
Can't see...
~Muchas gracias!
Those nights, the native women he'd brought from the coast made them tortillas,
Some compensation,
Those clouds are not going to lift.
As they marched deeper inland, they heard more about what lay ahead
After the mountains, though, things got no better,
Through autumn hailstorms, they trekked across a desolate plain of salt lakes with no food or water,
Cortes was heading for the fertile land of Tlaxcala,
Tlaxcala was an independent city state,
They hated the Aztecs,
Cortes was hoping they'd shelter him, but his luck was out,
They attacked him in a savage battle, 0n the battlefield, they still plough up the debris,
Estoy buscando la ruta de Hernan Cortes.
#La batalla?
#Es aqui?
~Si, si, si!
Looks like glass, but this is obsidian.
See the sharp edge?
They had a row of these things set into the wood of the clubs that they used.
Nasty wound, but nothing like Spanish steel.
"There were 149,000 of them," Cortes wrote to the King, in Julius Caesar mode,
It was touch and go, He hung on grimly on this little hill for two weeks,
Then, with their own losses mounting to the Spanish guns, the Tlaxcalans offered him a deal,
They welcomed him to their town and laid on a fiesta, even offered their daughters in marriage,
The Tlaxcalans had realised that these strangers with their guns could help free them from the Aztecs,
Ever since, they've been accused by other Mexicans oo betraying their country, But of course, that's not how they see it,
(MAN SPEAKS IN SPANISH)
(TRANSLATl0N) Xicotencatl, the elder, reaches for Hernan Cortes who returns the embrace, but doesn't let go of his sword.
The old Xicotencatl knew the future of his people was at stake.
He believed this alliance would ensure that Tlaxcalans would not disappear from the map, would not disappear from history.
The alliance of the Tlaxcalans is the turning point of the whole story, the turning point in the history of the New World.
With them, Cortes found allies who hated the Aztecs and would fight them to the death.
Allies who would give him support, provisions and manpower.
The possibility of conquering Mexico was now on.
So Cortes marched on, with several thousand Tlaxcalan warriors behind him,
To the greatest pilgrimage city in the Americas, Cholula, under the volcano Popocatepetl,
These were friends of the Aztec ruler Montezuma, and the Tlaxcalans warned Cortes to expect trouble,
As the Spanish moved through the town, they saw roadblocks in the side streets.
Piles of stones heaped on the rooftops, women and children evacuated.
Then Malinche heard a story that a plot was being hatched to ambush Cortes.
He decided on a pre-emptive strike.
The doors were closed.
The Spaniards killed them all.
And they killed 3,000 more Cholulans assembled outside.
Then their Tlaxcalan allies sacked the town.
"And so death came to Cholula," says the Aztec account,
"When we got the news, we were seized with fear,
"It was as if the earth itself were shaking,"
"My heart burns as if it 's been washed in chillies, " said Montezuma,
From Cholula, Cortes continued up the old track through the forests of P opocatepetl,
It was erupting then, as it is now,
into the valley of Mexico,
In the distant haze, they began to make out a vast blue lake, And then, at last, far away, approached on immense causeways, was the city of Cortes' dreams,
"It seemed like an enchanted vision," wrote one of his men,
"Indeed, some of our soldiers asked whether it was not all a dream,
"It was so wonderful "that I do not know how to describe this first glimpse "of things never heard of seen or dreamed oo before,
"The city had traders and warriors, priests and lawyers, "musicians, jugglers, courtesans and scribes,
"It was the most beautiful thing in the world, " wrote Cortes,
Believe it or not, that's where the causeway came in in the 16th century!
This is where the lake ended and the city began.
This is where Cortes walked that November 1519.
The Aztec city started here.
To find the place where Cortes and Montezuma met, you have to go right into the commercial heart of modern Mexico City,
The site today is inside the Hospital of Jesus,
To get there, you have to go through Accident and Emergencyl
The Aztecs led the Spanish into a great courtyard framed by a beautiful building that was on this spot.
The tale of that momentous meeting is told by the Aztec eye-witnesses,
This is where the two worlds met.
It's where Montezuma addressed Cortes.
"0h, my lord," he said,
"you are fatigued, you are weary after your long journey.
"At last you have come down to earth.
"You have come to your city of Mexico which I have guarded for you for a little while.
"They said you would return, and now you have done so.
"But first, go to your palace and rest.
"And go in peace."
Mysterious words, but what do they mean?
Was this the language of Aztec diplomacy?
0r Montezuma's acceptance of destiny?
No one knows,
But in the Aztec calendar, that day, the 8th of November, was 1-Wind, the day of Quetzalcoatl, a day of robbery violation and deceit,
And the Aztecs knew that nothing ever happened by chance,
"It was as if we'd all eaten stupefying mushrooms, " say the Aztec witnesses,
"We kept our children off the streets and the city went to sleep
"in a fearful slumber,"
The city woke as it always had
In the streets of the modern world, we can only dimly imagine its splendour,
The flutes and conch shells greeting the dawn, the bustle of merchants, the thousands oo blooms carried each day to markets drenched in the scents of the Americas,
The Spaniards were open-mouthed at the sights, the gleaming stucco of the palaces and pyramids,
They wandered the courtyards, gawped at strange gods,
But on the wind, with the scent of flowers, they caught the ever-present smell of death,
And in their hearts, they feared that Cortes the gambler had led them into the jaws of hell,
Montezuma, though, was still unsure who Cortes was, and who his master was, the great King Charles across the sea,
Trying hard to appear calm, the Spaniards entered the chamber,
The first thing the Spanish noticed when they came inside was the disgusting smell.
As their eyes got used to the darkness, they saw the eyes of the Aztec gods staring at them, gleaming with precious stones.
The war god, Huitzilopochtli, was sitting down with a golden bow and arrow.
In front of him was a brazier full of human hearts, still warm.
All around, the walls were encrusted with dried blood.
Cortes then said this to Montezuma -
"I don't understand how a prince as great as you "and a man as intelligent as you, could think that these are gods.
"They are bad things called devils "and I'd like your permission to put a cross and a picture of the Virgin Mary in here."
Montezuma took offence at that.
"If I thought you were going to be so insulting to our gods, "I would never have brought you to see them.
"We hold these things to be good.
"They bring us health, harvest, rain and water "and we must sacrifice to them.
"So please don't mention this again."
It was quite a gulf
For the Christians, God gave his blood to redeem mankind
For the Aztecs, mankind must give its blood to redeem the gods,
A week passed Cortes had to act,
He raises the stakes with an unbelievable gamble,
At gunpoint he arrests Montezuma,
"What we want you to do is to come over to the palace where we're lodging.
"Quietly and with no fuss.
If you raise the alarm, we will kill you."
Montezuma is amazed.
Nothing he learned in the Palace of Nobles prepared him for this.
"My person cannot be taken prisoner," he says to Cortes.
"Even if I were to like it, my people would never accept it."
The argument goes on for four hours, Montezuma in tears at one point.
All the while, Cortes's captains are pacing up and down, getting more and more nervous.
0ne of them says, "Either he comes with us now or we kill him now."
And when Malinche translates that, Montezuma caves in.
Montezuma was now in Cortes' power, maybe under his spell,
He continued to issue orders as if things were normal, but he'd lost the trust of his people,
The tale has been told many times,
How the angry, mob besieged the Spanish, how Cortes bullied poor broken Montezuma to plead with them,
But Montezuma's aura had drained away and his people killed him,
The Spaniards were trapped inside the city, food and water cut off,
His dream slipping from his grasp, Cortes was forced to give the order to escape,
You have to remember the city was on an island completely surrounded by water, linked to the mainland only by three great causeways.
All the bridges had been broken by the Aztecs.
So in those final few hours, the Spaniards built a portable wooden bridge out of the ceiling beams of where they were staying.
They would leave at midnight.
The night was clear, with a gentle rain,
The Spaniards marched in silence, hugging their gold
Half-way into the lake, they were spotted
The alarm was raised and the city woke,
Cortes was trapped The Aztec witnesses name the place, Today it's by the little post office on the Tacuba road
Three quarters of the Spaniards were left behind - 800 men - killed, drowned or captured.
The captives could expect only one fate at the hands of the enraged Aztecs.
They were taken back into the city to the Great Pyramid.
There their hearts were cut out and offered to Huitzilopochtli, the god of war.
0n the far shore, Cortes gathered the survivors by a huge ceiba tree, It's still there,
Malinche, they say, showed no emotion,
But Cortes, for once, couldn 't control his feelings,
They said there were tears in Cortes' eyes that night, "the night of tears".
But of all his comrades who died, he asked after only one -
Martin Lopez, the shipbuilder.
When Cortes heard that Lopez had survived, although badly wounded, he said, "Vamos.
Que nada nos falta."
"0K, let's go. For we lack nothing."
"And when the Spaniards had thus gone," say the Aztecs,
"we thought they had gone for ever and would never return, "
But across the mountains, the Tlaxcalans stood by Cortes,
And what he does now is one of the most amazing things in history,
In the middle of the land, he builds a fleet,
That's why he needed Martin Lopez,
They're going to build 13 brigantines.
All of them are more than 40 feet long.
Then they'll take them to bits and carry them to Mexico City!
What does the maestro think about this?
(TRANSLATl0N) They disassembled the fleet as there are no navigable rivers round here.
For Mexicans, Cortes was a very cruel man.
But from a buccaneering point of view, he was great!
Cortes would not let go of his dream,
And now, inexorably, the net began to tighten around the Aztecs,
Cortes transports his prefabricated fleet, carried in pieces by a train of 8,000 Tlaxcalan porters,
Across the mountains and back to the lake,
0n the lake shore, he waited, reinforced now by thousands of hative allies,
It was May 1521,
Cortes' moment of destiny had arrived
It was to be nothing less than a war of the worlds,
It was a new kind of warfare for the Mexicans, involving the ordinary population, women and children, starving them.
This wasn't part of war in ancient Mexico, but Cortes was a modern man.
It was total war, The siege lasted for 80 days,
A quarter of a million people were reduced to eating lizards and grass,
In the last battle, the Aztecs were squashed into the warren of streets round the Great Pyramid in the north, in Tlatelolco,
I'm looking for the ancient barrios of Mexico City, not the modern ones.
I want to go to the area of Tepito.
- Tepito?
- Yeah. Do you know it?
Yes, but it's a little dangerous.
You don't care?
- Yacacoco?
- Lacolchoko?
Amashak?
- No, I don't know anything about it.
- Do you have a map?
Maybe I can help...
What kind of map is that?
- It's from 1772!
- You have a rum deal, man!
Mexico City's got a bit bigger since then!
It seems crazy, but this map, drawn in 1772,
Mexico City is still inside what was the old island.
You can still see the network of canals and the main roads of the Aztec city are still there.
To the end, the Mexicans viewed the Spaniards as contemptible people who killed brave warriors at a distance with guns,
In the Aztec calendar, the final day was 3-Serpent, the beginning of the time of lamentation and remembrance,
The day human beings were reminded of their place in the remorseless cycle of time,
This is where the war ended, the exact spot.
This little church was built on the place where Cuauhtemoc surrendered.
I find the Aztec version of this story as powerful and moving as Homer's "Iliad", the tale of Troy.
The Aztecs accept their fate without a trace of self-pity.
It's as if, in their vision of time and destiny, the cycle of history, the bundle of years, had just been loaded against them.
The Aztec lamentations have been handed down to us,
"Broken spears line the streets,
"We have torn our hair in grief
"0ur houses are roofless now, "our walls red with blood
"0ur inheritance, our city, is lost,
"The shields of our warriors were its defence "but they could not save it,
"0ur heritage is gone,"
A year or two after the conquest, while a new Mexico was rising on the ruins of the old,
Cortes founded a hospital for the good of his soul on the spot where Montezuma had welcomed him,
By then, the King of Spain had showered him with honours,
The poor boy from Medellin had become the most famous man in Christendom,
His talents served him well.
The gambler who gambled everything and won.
But maybe in the end it was a hollow victory.
For in achieving his dream, he had to ruin it.
It's given to few people in history single-handedly to destroy a civilisation.
(SL0W DRUMBEAT)
Trujillo, Spain.
In the early 16th century two boys grew up here, dreaming of gold and conquest,
But when they left Spain for the New World, they became deadly enemies in one of the epic dramas of history the search for El Dorado,
(TRAIN'S KLAX0N BL0WS)
Even at the time, there were those among the Spanish conquerors who realised the immense historical significance of the fall of the New World.
"These are the greatest events," wrote one of them, "since the beginning of the world."
And the most cataclysmic of them took place in just a few years, 1520s, the fall of the Aztecs, and then the fall of Peru in the 1530s.
And then the story shifts here to Ecuador, as thousands of Europeans flood into the continent, seeking new lands of gold.
Among them was a Spanish captain called Francisco 0rellana,
A veteran of the Inca wars, 0rellana was to be the hero of one of the most amazing journeys of exploration,
Early in 1541, he came here to Quito,
The old northern capital of the Incas, Quito was now a Spanish frontier town, 0rellana had come to find his cousin, the new governor Gonzalo Pizarro,
Handsome and cruel, Gonzalo was in his early 30s now, the greatest warrior in the New World
But Gonzalo was a man whose greed had not been satisfied even by the gold of the Incas,
0nly four years after the fall of P eru, Pizarro was dreaming of hew conquests,
From the rooftops of his palace in Quito, he could see the Andes rising to the east,
Early in 1541, a rumour began to sweep the city that beyond the mountains there lay a land richer than Mexico or even Peru,
A land of gold
The ruler of this land was said to be so rich that he covered himself in gold dust every, day and washed it off each evening,
He was the golden man of El Dorado,
"I was fascinated," said P izarro,
"And I determined to discover that land and to conquer it, "
And we set out to follow him,
We took an expedition doctor with us, John Colley,
Above 10,000 feet, you get altitude sickness potentially, so where are we at now?
Yeah, we're coming up to 12,000 feet here.
All through these campaigns, they had to operate at high altitude.
They developed this kind of cotton, thick, quilted cotton armour to fight in the tropics.
But, of course, you're dead on the equator here, but you come to this altitude and you're in serious trouble.
Beyond the peaks, they entered a drenched green world, with streams and waterfalls, which eventually become the Amazon,
They might as well have been wanderers on the surface of an alien planet,
Pizarro's route has never been traced on the ground
(MAN WHISTLES)
(MAN CALLS 0UT) - 0K?
0h, Jesus Christ.
(GR0ANS)
How many people did Pizarro bring down here?
It's quite slippery here.
(WHISTLING)
Are the horses with us?
- (MAN CALLS 0UT)
- Yeah, good.
- How many people did he have with him?
- 220 conquistadors.
4,000 native bearers.
200 horses, hundreds of hunting dogs.
Hundreds of llamas to carry gear.
To Pizarro's alarm, his vast army of native bearers was rapidly wasting away,
The Spanish had 4,000 native bearers with them from the highlands, but they all died by the time they reached the plains.
The history books say they were highland people who came down here and couldn't cope, but why should 4,000 have died, do you think?
Was it malaria?
Not malaria.
That was something the Spanish brought over with them.
0f course, there were all these other infectious diseases like measles and smallpox and so forth.
But these big waves of epidemics would have been through already, before this expedition set off, so I wonder if there was something else.
We should ask Delphine.
He's the expert.
Starvation, I think.
(SPEAKS SPANISH) 0ur guide Delphine was a man who knows how to survive in the forest,
(B0TH SPEAK SPANISH)
I think it would be impossible to feed them.
You can imagine trying to find food in this area for that huge number of people.
So the 4,000 Indians basically were starved to death.
I presume they'd be the bottom of the feeding chain as well.
And basically left to fend for themselves as things got really tough.
"The terrain was terrible," said P izarro,
"We had to hack our own path through,
"And we were worn out already from the crossing of the Andes, "
Food was a growing problem, even for the Spaniards,
"In the end, " says Pizarro, "we were forced to eat the buds of a plant like a vine stalk, "
0nly the little curly bud on the top.
That was before they started eating their precious horses,
At last we reached the first landmark described by the Spanish,
Hidden behind the falls, legend says, was the gold of the Inca Atahualpa,
(TRANSLAT0R) Those who are in touch with nature believe that the spirits exists here.
(SPANISH)
(TRANSLAT0R) Yes, this is a door to the spiritual world.
Everything the Spanish understand literally that the Indians actually mean metaphorically.
"And so we pushed on through thick forest," Pizarro says,
"hacking with axes and machetes,"
"0ften it was impossible to get our horses through, "
See what an effort it is just to hack a path through virgin forest.
You're lucky if you do a mile or two each day.
Can you imagine what this was like for hundreds of people and all their baggage and their animals trying to get their way through this?
It just doesn't bear thinking about.
At last, after six months in the jungle, they emerged from the Andes foothills and saw this view, an immense flat horizon,
Even with their limited knowledge, they must have known this stretched all the way to the Atlantic, But how far was that and what lay in between?
(MICHAEL) The big stones.
There's a branch under there.
They marched on down the Coca,
"There were many days," says Pizarro,
"when we were wading knee-deep, waist-deep or even worse, "
It's deep.
And still no sign of El Dorado,
By now, seven months in, the army was demoralised Many were too sick to move,
Though he hid it from his men, Pizarro was desperate,
0rellana now tried to persuade him to turn back, but Pizarro wouldn 't give up his quest,
He ordered his men to build a boat to carry, the sick and wounded and the heavy gear,
It took his starving troops a month to make, smelting their horseshoes to forge the nails,
But there was an easier way, Using renewable balsa wood, we made a traditional raft with hardwood nails and ropes oo bark,
With this, we hoped to follow Pizarro down the Coca to the River Napo,
It just goes to show.
The Spanish went to all that trouble about getting nails and you only need some hard wood and some soft wood and you can do it without metal.
We'll see if it works.
(SH0UTING)
It's our brigantine.
I don't think we'll do the full 3,000 miles on that, though.
I don't mind.
Pizarro's army set off again on the 9th of November, 1541, 0f the beauties of the landscape around them, there's no mention in his account,
This is what you never read in the history books.
You never feel the sense of this immense forest, stretching for 2,000 or more miles.
This immense blue sky and this great river.
Even with the boat, progress was painfully slow,
They could still only go as fast as the army, trudging along the bank,
They marched on for 43 days, Christmas came,
By now some of the Spaniards were dying of starvation,
Their Christmas was made even more miserable by the news that a vast uninhabited region lay ahead, where no food was to be found
It was Pizarro's nightmare,
Mutiny was in the air, And then 0rellana stepped forward
That Christmas, in their camp here by the river, the whole expedition deeply depressed by the struggle of the last ten months,
0rellana came up to Pizarro and said, "Look, give me the brigantine, give me the boat,
"and a few canoes, some of the men and I'll go downstream
"to try and find some food and I'll come back in three or four days."
Pizarro looked at him and said, "Whatever you think's best."
0rellana left next day with 57 men,
But within days, so he said later, he realised the current was too strong and he couldn 't go back,
"So we chose what seemed to us the lesser of two evils, " 0rellana said,
"trusting to God we'd go on and follow the river
"and either die or see what marvels lay ahead"
What he didn 't know was that ahead of him was the greatest river on earth,
The first few days they passed through an empty landscape, chewing their boots to stay alive, so close to death, they were hallucinating,
Then, on Monday evening, the 8th of January they heard drums, 0rellana landed and nervously went into the forest,
They were the first Europeans to walk in the interior of A mazonia, - Do you think they might be asleep?
- I don't think there's anybody home right now.
They've got their boots right here.
But they're obviously...
It's closed up.
There's nobody here.
Well, they did run away when 0rellana first landed.
Left their cooking pots and their food.
0rellana's men were starving, so, of course, they stuffed themselves.
The Indians were very nice about it when they came back.
The man's name was Tapui, Nelson Tapui,
He farmed here with his family, pretty much cut off from the outside world
He spoke Quechua, the Inca language,
(SPEAKS QUECHUAN)
0h, he'll have to talk slower than that.
And language would be the key to 0rellana's survival,
He began to put words down in a notebook,
What's the name in Quechuan?
- Lomo.
- Lomo.
So yoca is lomo.
"The captain made a point to get to understand the native languages, " says the diary,
And he made his own primer to help him, So if you ask for good water to drink, to drink.
Nelson sent his son up a tree to bring seed pods for us to eat,
The native people here were called Imara, They gave 0rellana food, too,
They let the Spaniards stay with them for a month to recover their health,
Saved them from death,
(THEY SPEAK QUECHUAN)
Can I open?
I could get into these.
At this moment, 0rellana was still thinking like a conquistador, He told his hosts that he was claiming them and their land for the King of Spain,
But maybe a change was beginning to take place in his mind, for kind treatment of the Indians, he said now, was the right way to follow,
0ver the coming months, 0rellana would make contact with many different Indian peoples,
Some, like Nelson, would feed and shelter him,
Some would try, to kill him,
The mum gives us a smile.
She thought we were aliens at first.
Back upriver, Pizarro was waiting for 0rellana to return, his men now dying around him,
And as the days turned to weeks, he began to suspect that his loyal cousin might have betrayed him,
0rellana's encounter with the Imara had offered hope of survival,
Now he and his men decided to get their story, straight,
They appointed a scribe to put down on paper why they'd deserted P izarro,
And each and every, one of them put his name to it,
"We've travelled 200 leagues through savage jungle," they said.
"We've all seen it with our own eyes.
"We've felt constant fear of losing our lives because of suffering and hunger.
"How much more danger and death would there be were we to turn back now?
"Therefore we all beg you," they say to 0rellana, "not to ask us to do this.
"And we ask our scribe to write it down.
"And we are all willing to follow you by any other route to save our lives.
"But not to turn back."
But was 0rellana being quite truthful?
0r did he hope to claim the secret of El Dorado for himself
We continued on his track, down the Coca to its junction with the Napo,
And this is, I suppose, the second conquisto, isn't it, you know.
First they came looking for gold and El Dorado and now the forests are being plundered.
They've had their rubber and now it's the hardwoods and it's black gold - oil.
- Adios, amigo. - Yeah, bye-bye.
When you get to Manaus, remember, if you go swimming, don't have a pee.
And so we said our goodbyes to Dr Colley, 0h, dear.
0ur next leg would take us down the Napo, the conquistadors' river of cinnamon,
Here's to the River Napo.
0rellana sailed on past other great rivers, the Aguarico, the Curaray, down into what is now Peru,
"We made good speed," says the diary,
"Sometimes more than 20 leagues a day, for the river's flow was swift and strong, "
0rellana was now on one of the main tributaries of the Amazon, heading east through a vast fluid wilderness,
From the air, it's a bewildering maze,
0ut here nature seems to have no bounds,
0rellana and his men must have gazed on the scene, part in wonder, part in terror,
A few days later, they came to a gigantic confluence, the Napo and the Maranon, the beginning of the Amazon proper,
And as 0rellana reached the Maranon, far to the west, Pizarro had finally given up hope of seeing him again and ordered his men to turn back,
There's a shift now in the tone of the expedition diary, kept by the priest, Father Carvajal,
It may be hindsight, but he seems aware now that the journey was turning into an epic of exploration,
"It seemed to us, by our continuing survival,
"that our Lord Jesus was pleased with such a great venture into the unknown,
"For such a feat of discovery, surely might not otherwise have taken place
"for many centuries into the future,"
- (W0MEN SING) - 0K.
- Bienvenido a 0rellana.
Buenas noches.
It was here that 0rellana first heard strange stories of a fierce tribe of female warriors, like the Amazons of Greek myth,
(RHYTHMIC F0LK S0NG)
His contemporaries never believed him, but he always swore the tale was true,
It's a myth which crops up in many places and maybe it's not just a myth,
and then they'd boot the men out.
Are there still...
Can you still find women like this on the Amazon?
(W0MAN TRANSLATES)
(TRANSLAT0R) Ah, dominant.
Yes, there are woman who are dominant.
0f course.
Yes, there are women who have power over the men.
(W0MAN SINGS NATIVE FOLKBALLAD)
No one knows for sure whether the Amazons really existed
But they gave the river the name it still has today, Rio Amazonas, the river of the Amazons,
(W0MAN SINGS FOLKBALLAD)
All the way through what is now Peru, the local people treated these strangers from another world kindly,
But did 0rellana ever see them as fully human like himself
I think he remained a conquistador,
Nonetheless, he was still carefully recording words from the river languages,
(W0MAN SPEAKS L0CAL DIALECT)
"Next to God, " says the diary "the captain's understanding of the native languages
"was the deciding factor in saving us all from death, "
(THEY SPEAK L0CAL DIALECT)
0rellana's diary, is the first description of the peoples of A mazonia,
"This part of the river, " he says, "they were part of a great federation, the Aparians, "
In the two centuries after the coming of the Spanish, 90% of the population here died from violence and disease,
Today the survivors are people living after a holocaust,
It was a tragedy which went almost unrecorded
Here in Iquitos, Father Joaquin is trying to set the record straight, to recover the lost history, of A mazonia,
(THEY SPEAK SPANISH)
In the 16th century these were big towns, large and well-organised communities,
So maybe what you see now is a distant reminder of what 0rellana saw,
(TRANSLAT0R) I had studied the case of 0rellana for a long time and I concluded that 0rellana met a huge diversity of peoples here.
We wondered what happened to all these people.
We reckon there were over six million in the whole of Amazonia.
In his library Father Joaquin has a copy of the original diary,
This is the hand...
This is the handwriting of Carvajal.
(TRANSLAT0R) "This account was written by Friar Gaspar de Carvajal, "a friar of the order of Dominicans,
"of the voyage of discovery down the great and famous river."
The famous great river.
(READS IN SPANISH)
"And I was an eyewitness to these amazing things, " says Carvajal,
"A man whom God chose to play a part in such a strange
"and hitherto never experienced voyage of discovery, "
This is the next stage of our Amazonian journey, the Natalia Carolina.
It says, "Heading for Cubagua today, six o'clock.
"Por mi madre sin falta." "0n my mother without fail."
Well, it's about half past six.
This is Amazon time.
0rellana stayed with the Aparians for two months to build a second, bigger boat, a 30-footer,
A boat strong enough for the sea,
When he left in late April, he still had 2,000 miles of river to go,
(W0MAN SINGS)
The missionaries, the prospectors and the debt raiders, they all came this way,
And the clamour of history, rose like the sound of the forest in the night,
And in the ghostly shapes we passed, it was easy to imagine the Spaniards on their fragile craft,
"What hardships, what suffering and what extraordinary, dangers we passed through, "
wrote Friar Carvajal, He lost an eye in one attack,
"The people are more hostile now,"
And as for 0rellana, too kind-hearted a soul by far, some said He had learned to read the signs and to negotiate fear, Most of all, perhaps, in himself
They now began to see canoes everywhere, They were approaching even richer lands,
By the middle point of the river, they came past huge settlements, extending for many miles, without any gaps between the clusters of houses.
These were large, well-organised communities, with thousands of people, real high cultures.
Main Street, Chinatown, Viciousville and Stupidville,
After three days' sailing, we reached the Brazilian frontier,
0rellana had to pass a border here, too - the frontier of the Machiparo state,
He had to fight his way through,
It's so relaxed today I couldn 't find anyone to stamp my passport,
Immigration?
But the spectre of Gonzalo Pizarro still haunted 0rellana and his men,
0rellana never forgot the potential cost of crossing Gonzalo Pizarro, a member of the most powerful family in the Americas.
Desertion, after all, was punishable by death.
And their boyhood friendship would count for very little.
So he and his men, all through the journey, covered themselves.
But, at this moment, they had no idea whether Pizarro was alive or dead.
Pizarro, though, was a man who could face death without flinching,
The tale of his hellish return has inspired movies, plays and books ever since,
"For suffering, famine and misery " wrote one conquistador,
"this was the worst journey ever in the Indies,"
Attacked all the way, Pizarro didn 't know where he was or what direction to take to reach Peru, or any place Christians might be,
"We ate all our dogs and horses," he wrote,
"and we got back with only our swords and the rotten rags we stood up in, "
Plzarro's only thought now was revenge against his boyhood chum, the worst liar that ever there was,
And 0rellana sailed on, as amazing spectacles of nature came one after the other,
In early June, 0rellana arrived at the site of Manaus, where the river stretches to the horizon, as wide as an inland sea,
Manaus was built in the centre of the rainforest, Founded as a Jesuit mission in the 18th century when the opening up of A mazonia really started
Where the opera house and the grand mansions now stand, 0rellana saw huge settlements of hative people lining the waterfront,
There are few places where you feel more strongly the all-consuming march of history,
Looking centuries into the future, 0rellana's diary, says this -
"It was our desire that, if possible, the land and its barbaric people
"should not have negative feelings about our first encounter,
"So that one day the country, might be tamed for pacification
"and reduced to obedience to our Christian civilisation, "
The western conception of a city was a new innovation in the Americas which came with the conquest.
They require a new way of life, new laws and customs and institutions to make a new identity, to reshape humanity, if you like.
They also suck in the products of the natural world, of the forest and the river, and consume them.
And in that, cities like this, Manaus, represent a break in that continuum of thousands of years of life here in the Americas.
There may have been five million indigenous people here, when 0rellana came through.
The present population of the natives of Amazonia is 250,000, less than a quarter of this city.
That's the scale of the revolution.
At last, after eight months on the river and against all the odds, in August, 1542, 0rellana reached the mouth of the Amazon,
They had sailed 2,500 miles down the greatest river on earth, They had seen unknown empires and encountered lost worlds,
"It had been less of a journey," said one of them, "more of a miracle,"
But even as their makeshift boats carried the 47 survivors to safety in the Caribbean, back in Quito, Gonzalo Pizarro was petitioning the King for revenge,
Pizarro accused 0rellana of treason, a crime punishable by death,
"Captain 0rellana paid no heed to the duty that he owed Your Majesty,
"and to the wellbeing of the army and the whole expedition.
"Instead of bringing us back food, he displayed to us all the greatest cruelty
"that ever faithless men have shown.
"And he's the worst traitor that ever lived."
In his defence, 0rellana used the documents that they'd drawn up on the river.
"Pizarro wasn't telling the truth.
What happened was his responsibility.
"The fact was we couldn't get back to him.
"And, in the end, it was God's will that we went on to make such amazing discoveries."
Pizarro never came home,
He died fighting the Crown for his family's empire in Peru,
His house is still there, the garden where he and Gonzalo crossed toy swords as boys,
He married a wealthy young wife, Anna, but he couldn 't settle back in Spain,
He petitioned the King to send him back to HIS river, with the title of Governor of the Amazon,
But his luck ran out, The expedition was a disaster,
This is how Anna remembered 0rellana's death.
"My husband couldn't find the main channel of the river
"and, for 11 months, we wandered around like lost people.
"And in that time, we suffered such hardships,
"because of hunger, disease and incessant rainfall.
"We ate all the horses and the dogs
"and, in the end, almost all the expedition died.
"My husband among them."
Hello, I would like you to touch wood
Do you know this expression ?
The easiest way to understand it is referring to the heatwave of 2003 we have well known, may be more in the countryside with agricultural production.
In 2003 this is my place that's what grew and I did not harvested.
When we see this as a farmer one has the right to wonder about the future.
That's why I brought you wood that I will distribute.
Touching wood, I think it's good
It makes you feel calm.
It's nice and it smells good.
Here's a piece for each of you, if you want to distribute.
It's cherry and plum.
There are probably few in Paris.
Pass it to the others and we will do a simple experiment
to show that these branches are the future of agriculture.
It seems crazy !
We hear of Agriculture at the edge of the drama
and it is true that agriculture is on the brink and we are on the brink.
I'll show you the same experience as I had.
You take the branch and you do like that.
It can be shaped like a circle very easily.
And what I experienced in 2003, in 2004 I did not experienced.
Because the flexibility of these small branches that are produced every year growing every day the forest makes them.
The best model for agriculture is the forest because the forest does not need humans.
Agriculture has derived to the assistantship, to technology.
Farmers who don't understand ground anymore.
Farmers have forgotten that the best model and pragmatism of life encourage us to watch the living.
From the living, the forest is the best example.
No human intervention no watering, no fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides it works alone.
When I discovered the flexibility of the small branch I wondered :
why the branches of large diameter break easily ?
Whereas we can shape small branches as a circle that represent the virtuous circle of trees which produces branches in huge quantities.
I found on the internet an explanation of the forest and its soil.
We learn that leaves are attached to small branches it is not because they are fed up that they fall.
They restore 50 to 60% of their content to the branches.
In this branch you are holding,
there all the nutrients which allow buds in a few months to make new branches which contain branches for the following year.
Trees restart their growth only with the content of the small branches.
On large diameter branches there are no such nutrients.
As you read this, you think you can already act individually and talk about it to friends and we will cut branches.
This is a technical operation, but not insurmountable.
In Africa, we do it with a machete.
We spread it on the ground a layer of 3 to 5 cm, no more.
We realize that this is not prohibitive for a garden with this material which is hidden here.
I will open it later.
When it is placed on the ground in winter, spring we incorporate it.
You mean there is something about seasons?
At the arrival of winter, the branches store nutrients.
It's going nowhere but in the branches, only at that time.
In the spring, those elements are diffused again.
So we proceed to what is called incorporation.
After a few weeks the agricultural soil that was here mainly stones has become this.
60 to 90 days after application of a 3 cm thick layer.
Here is the top and there underneath.
We see mycelium, the real mushroom.
The mycelium is our collaborator to do what nature does only with mushrooms food chain with the lignin molecule.
The lignin molecule is very energetic and here comes a complex food chain of the soil.
The cultivated agricultural land becomes a forest soil.
It is a copy / paste of forest soil / agricultural land.
It works surprisingly for this stony soil with the RCW to grow wheat
with yields almost higher than normal.
The surprise is enormous, because the trees grow too as well as vegetables.
There you are on limestone plateaus of Quercy I invite you to my place.
I brought you bracnches from my place, but here it is.
Zucchini grow in full sun.
No watering, just seedlings.
I plant the seeds in the ground and wait for it to grow.
This year, with 12 zucchinis, I picked up 190 kilos.
No watering, no phytosanitary treatment, no weed control.
It might looks like the Garden of Eden we put the seeds in the ground and harvest.
These are my productions.
Unfeasible on the plateau.
When you say you are going to grow carrots on limestone plateaus everyone says it, agronomists, experts there are 30 to 40% of stones,
30 cm of soil, impossible.
No water, no fertilizer, no treatment.
Yields are 160 to 170 %.
The amount of dry matter is 30% extra.
No evidence of disease, plague, aphids or pests
It seems magical.
No human intervention.
It is like facing the forest without human intervention.
Is it still agriculture ?
Is this a new concept?
Even in Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, gestures are the same, the results are the same.
When small branches are grinded, we put a thin layer on the floor we see the same phenomenon.
Mushrooms of a certain family will take nutrients triggers a food chain which induces life returning in soil.
I have not mentioned the name, but it is RCW
W for Wood
R for Ramial, branches you have in your hand a very special part of the tree bearing leaves, where photosynthesis happens.
Energy from the sun, transformed by the leaves is stored in the branches
This concept bothers agronomy, the farming profession must be reinvented.
You imagine a farm with 20 to 30% of forest area or wood.
It can occur without soil conditioner with 50% less water at least and a yield of 160 to 170%.
You do it every 4-5 years.
It is about sustainability
This concept affects many people but research has difficulties to take it in account.
This package, for those who want, we can share it because it works in the garden, in a flower pot, with a lemon tree or a plant that you like.
You put a layer of 3 to 5 cm thick and it works !
You will have the most beautiful fruits less watering needs and besides it's beautiful, it smells good.
For those that want to smell and take some there is a characteristic smell of forest.
I invite you to share this meal with the ground.
C of RCW stands for Chipped
Subtitle and translation :
This is a rocket stove.
Rocket stoves generally create much more efficient combustion and are better able to store heat than conventionnal stoves.
which means that you can put long pieces of wood, directly into the stove and it doesn't have to be cut to be able to burn.
On the inside of the barrel but on the outside of the part that comes up in the middle.
All the flue gas will travel down around the outside of the barrel and out through the back and up, out of the chimney.
All this cob here that surrounds the stove is designed to capture the heat from the combustion so that it's not just all going straight up the chimney.
With a conventionnal stove the heat tends to travel out of the building very quickly.
This allows for more of the heat to be stored in the building and then slowly the heat is released over time out of the cob.
So, this is the sky house rocket stove
It is a sort of a wall in between our dinning room and our living room.
Basically, you got the intake here the barrel is here and you can see there is a very large amount of cob surrounding most of the barrel here.
This entire wall is actually a cob wall.
So, here we are on the other side of the wall, in the dining room.
Here is the other side of the barrel encased in cob and then the flue of the rocket stove runs all the way through this bench and up that chimney.
There is about 4 to 6 inches of cob on top of the flue here on the bench so they can take a few hours before it heats up.
I would say 2 or 3 hours but then it wil stay warm throughout the day.
to be an area, where you are physically in contact with.
Like this bench.
We oil the bench to waterproof it cause it is near the table.
The chimney runs up as cob all the way up into the second story and that, again stores thermal mass up into the bedrooms, upstairs as well.

welcome to Basalt Mountain located on the northern rim of the Roaring Fork valley in Colorado.
The climate here is hot and dry in the summer and frigid in the winter.
To the point were only a small number of plant and animal species can survive here.
until now no one would have considered farming in this dry rocky nutrient poor soil.
Jerome Osentowski is the man behind the ecosystem and the Central Rocky Mountain Permaculture Institute.
I came to Colorado in 1969 and I spent about the first seven or eight, ten years As a ski instructor.
and gradually got interested in healthy foods
In combinations of designs
what's nice about it is that they can come and eat the fruits see the combination of plants in our forest gardens and see how we build our greenhouse
But Jerome's success in Permaculture hasn't come without some major road blocks
In 2008 a devastating fire burned down one of his first tropical greenhouse's Ironically named Pele [after the Hawaiian fire goddess] to the ground.
the fire in Pele was actually a blessing in disguise.
because we were able to take new technology and design a much bigger, better greenhouse.
So I worked with Michael Thomson my partner in Ecosystems Design to redesign the new greenhouse.
Hi I'm Michael Thompson,
I'm chief architect with ecosystems design in Basalt Colorado and partner with Jerome Osentowski.
and then that air circulates over and over again picking up heat and then delivering it underground and storing it.
in addition to designing indoor and outdoor Permaculture and edible landscapes
We create the buildings that allow that indoor growing, such as this one in Steamboat Springs.
This is a large thirty six by eighty foot greenhouse that will support sub-tropical and anything below that.
So as a result we get these indoor environments that are very well insulated and heated against winter conditions such as this last year.
and when we have a condition like this where we have very cold weather and snow around the building inside what were experiencing is uhh...
This is when we began the planting of this greenhouse last autumn, and this spring we had this much growth in there.
and these greenhouses also function very well as early propagation centers
Where we can start the plants in February that will grow outdoors as annuals.
So we also do solar homes solar energy productive buildings.

Water is life.
Bassin de rétention d'eau à Tamera (Portugal)
avec Sepp Holzer et Benrd Müller
Water is the most important thing.
The whole world is 70% water.
We, animals, everything-70% water.
Water is the key issue for the survival human kind on this planet.
Nature has provided enough water everywhere on earth;
but, a billion people do not have sufficient access to clean drinking water.
More and more regions lack the water to grow the food they need.
Centralized systems of artificial water management cannot solve this problem.
We need de-centralized systems of natural water management.
We are in Tamera Peace Research Center in southern Portugal, where a water retention landscape has been in development since summer 2007.
Bernd Muller is responsible for Tamera's ecological research work.
In 2007 the community of Tamera still had the question whether a site of this size threatened by desertification could provide food, water and energy for 300 people.
We visited Sepp Holzer and asked him this question and he brought us this gift the vision of a water landscape.
Sepp Holzer, an Austrian mountain farmer, is a well-known specialist and visionary for permaculture and landscape healing.
Water is always at the core of his work.
For me water is the most important capital.
Wherever it's possible, you should create retention spaces and collect the rain water and re-learn with the water how to maintain a balance.
This is the most important thing because once you've created the right hydrological balance,
70% of the work is done.
ou help rich vegetation to develop, diversity ecause nature can reveal itself and develop in the right way.
In many parts of the world, countries are not able to feed their population anymore. They have been unable to maintain their natural wildlife for a long time.
As a consultant in many countries
Sepp Holzer sees the consequence of deforestation, monoculture, overgrazing and industrial agriculture.
All these factors destroy the natural water balance.
The soil is drying out. Water is being lost and the retention space, the natural water storage system of the earth, is becoming dry and the flora and fauna disappear.
In the end the land will turn into desert or burn ecause it's so dry.
You can see these problems happening all over the world, bringing huge catastrophes.
And the heavy rains come anyway.
The water rushes down the slopes because the dry soil does not absorb the water.
When the soil is hotter than the falling rain it rejects the water.
Only when the soil is cooler, when the vegetation is giving shadow then it attracts the water and lets it seep in.
This is the construction site for a new water retention space in Tamera.
Wherever you work with soil you can read the signs of erosion.
Topsoil should actually form a thick, living layer everywhere on the ground which enables rainwater to filter in.
But, this layer has been eroded away.
Now the topsoil lies in layers many meters thick in the bottom of valleys or is found as mud in rivers.
The surface of fields and sites higher up is depleted and barren.
De-centralized water retention landscapes give the water time to filter back into the earth body.
People always have the same questions, always the same worries, where will all this water come from ?
in such dusty dry soil without streams or a river.
How can I build a lake here ?
People have simply lost the knowledge of how to use the catchment area and the rain, the blessing of the water in the right way.
When I use the catchment area, thereupon, the lake will fill very quickly.
How much water can change a landscape in a short time.
We can see here, comparing Tamera before the creation of Lake 1 and today.
Water retention landscapes can be built everywhere.
Anywhere on earth.
A water retention space must not be sealed with concrete or plastic.
It is enough to build a dam out of natural material at the narrowest point of a valley.
You dig a ditch until you reach an impermeable layer.
On that solid ground you apply layer after layer of fine material, like moist clay and drive on it and roll it to build the water barrier.
This water barrier is the core of the dam.
For the outside of the dam I take course material, it doesn't have to be dense and water-proof. Of course,
I will also have to compact it by driving on it and rolling it.
The water in a water retention landscape stays fresh and alive by itself.
Since we created the first retention space, we can already keep much of the water from the winter rainfalls on the land.
In this way in can unfold its full healing capacity, the wildlife is responding and is returning and the vegetation is recovering.
The water which used to run away and which is now stored here is at the same time also having an impact on the whole groundwater system.
In the first year, a spring developed below this lake which now gives water throughout the year.
Since we built this first dam, we no longer have such big variations with a lot of flowing water in winter when it's raining and droughts in the summer.
We have a more constant water situation throughout the year, which is of course a huge benefit for nature.
Ask nature, think with her and not against her.
Put yourself in her place and you get all the answers you need.
Make room in your head so that natural thinking has space to happen.
A forest garden is a three dimensional garden of useful plants.
because every time you dig the soil, a lot of carbon goes into the air.
This is Chinese dogwood, which is as you can see, a fantastic beautiful plant in flower but actually has a very nice edible fruit which follows later in the year.
and so on. So there is plants for all sources of different uses.
There's ... I think forest gardens will have a role to play they are ... you know there is an awful lot of interest at the moment in forest gardens.
therefore is quite ... seems quite difficult for people and farmers to access because, you know, they are not comfortable with trees.
So that's a potential problem that could slow down, you know, the implementation of more agroforestry based systems on farming.
But I think it needs to happen and I think slowly it will happen but ...
well typically from, you know, the West.
grow most of it here.
Forest gardens are resilient because of the ... because of the diversity, really.
you know if you're talking about 200 types of food plant, people, initially, might be slightly overwhelmed, but actually ...
they know everyone, they recognize every one, you know they know exactly what they are picking that's no reason we couldn't do the same.
And I suspect ... you know diverse diet will lead to more resilient people as well.
Bamboos are fantastically useful plants and of course in China and Japan or other parts of Asia they use bamboo for more things that you could think of.
you can hear the fibers unfurling and crackling away.
on perennial crops than on annuals as a rule.
which are beneficial fungi that form relationships with almost all plant roots.
And they do some amazing things :
So that's how things like nitrogen from my nitrogen fixing trees gets around to fruit trees that need it the fungi move it for you.
The other thing that this fungi do, which has really just been discovered in the last few years is critical in sequestering carbon in stable states in the soil.
So without them you wouldn't get sequestration into the soil.
And of course you don't get these fungi where you dig the soil.
This is pokeroot which is a quite a well known American wild edible.
You cook those and they have a sort of healthy asparagus flavor to them really, really substantial vegetable.
because you know green potatoes are quite poisonous.
I mean my estimate is that you could certainly feed 4-5 people of an acre of forest garden.
and each of those will form a roundish fruit so the black seed in the middle and a sort of pink shell round the outside.
It's actually that pink shell which is the spice you don't have to use black pepper if you have something like this.
Welcome to the New Afrika Shrine.

All Afro-beat lovers, music lovers from around the world come here to have a ball.
And a ball they have.
You're a white man, yeah, and I'm a black man!
Africa, one love!
Shoki oh!
Femi oh!
Femi has a show at 9:00.
But, being a good musician, he's doing the right thing:
He needs to rehearse, do his voice training, play his sax, tune it before the show.
Even if you come on Monday, when we're not working, you'll still hear him playing his sax, his trumpet, maybe his keyboard... he does that all the time.
In the bathroom, he plays his trumpet!
Hey, your tickets, bros!
Your tickets!
Femi live and direct!
Brothers and sisters, welcome to a Sunday jump at New Afrika Shrine, and the last day of recording of our new album.
Anyway, say your feet come here all the way, in these times of trouble in our country, no money, no salary, no hospital, everything...
So you come all the way from Apapa, Victoria Island...
Fadeyi, Isale Awori, Ajuwon, Omole... And all over Lagos!
We're delighted that you are here with us tonight.
You say: "They talk too much for Sunday jump", we're here to make you happy, give you the good vibes you deserve.
Yesterday dem tell us say
Say today na we go gain
So we struggle suffer dey
For this new democratic change
But the truth of the matter be say
Them disguise another way
To continue their crooked ways
O yes dem bobo
Dem bobo your mama
Dem bobo your papa
Dem bobo your granmama
Dem bobo your granpapa
Dem bobo the market women
Dem bobo your journalist
The human right activist
In the name of democrazy
We have about 2000 people on Tuesdays and Thursdays at rehearsals.
And it looks like many of them feel part of this place, feel like this is their home.
They feel like my life revolves around their life, they feel like they're part of what's going on here.
I just thought that if they feel part of it, why don't I make everything open?
So that I have no secrets when I am writing a song.
Everybody's here while I do it.
I feel comfortable because of the life I'm living.
So... I know them, it's like a participation.
They're all like "What's on the next album?".
All of you vote for it.
I'm confused myself.
Tell me what you'd love to say...
Let me tell you...
Can't Buy Me and Shoki, we want them on the album!
What we can do for you is this: We can vote democratically.
Democratic elections!
Put your pen away, and be practical.
And so we say:
I say:
"Shotan?" Yeah...
Everybody loves Shotan.
No, so we cannot do that for all 18. You'll choose.
What you can do is, you can go find your supporter's club.
Write an official letter:
"This is what I want recorded..."
"We contest your presidency!"
You know you lost, even if you go to court!
Go to court, you will see!
You can even appeal!
Yeni, can you explain what's going on?
Some of us are protesting that our numbers didn't go in the charts.
- You don't agree with the choice?
We're complaining about a special number:
Can't Buy Me.
Who dat man talking to?
Him think say him dey talk to fool
Him work his way- to come near me
Just to come disturb my peace
Him ready to dash me many thing
Him wants to buy my loyalty
But he can't buy me
Can't buy me
Na so I dey watch am
As him dey boast to me
Na so I dey watch am
As him dey yab to me
Can't buy me!
Him start boast of him property
Him get land here, Him get land there
Him don get land for everywhere
Him get 12 car Him get 10 house
Na so I dey watch am
As him dey boast to me
Femi, the voice of Africa!
Ambassador of Africa!
His Excellency!
Positive Force!
Son of Fela Ransome!
African president!
Ambassador of Africa!
Let him through!
We do not have to remind ourselves of the announcement of Shotan, also known by the name Shé wéré.
Do not throw any type of beverage, including... Chelsea, beer, Squadron, stout.
If you think I'm a squadron leader, all you have to do is go to the barracks.
Do not throw your Don Simon or Araga.
Whatever may be the drink, do not splash water on your fellow human beings, you wouldn't do it at home.
Can you throw it on your father?
You can't.
If Tinunbu came here, you would be shaking.
As I was saying, do not!
Do not throw water on him!
Obviously you are too drunk to listen to my announcement, so, let us continue...
Have you lost your heads?
Shotan, shotan, shotan
We don tell you many times before
Say na you go come to regret
So the government of Obasanjo
Go carry all of us go for hell
You carry your ponpose self about
You say you no want to hear
Now everything don scatter for your face
Senior mugo shotan o
Shotan, shotan, shotan
They enjoyed it, especially during Sunday jump.
Did you see how full it was?
Everybody was happy, enjoying themselves, and jumping and everything, which is good.
And then they relax, you know?
Because in Nigeria, life is not easy for anyone.
Cost of living, there's no lights, no water, the schools are poor...
It's not easy.
The salaries aren't paid, pensions aren't paid, so everything isn't going smoothly.
We want to have somewhere you can sit, forget everything, go there for some time. I think it's great.
Femi's doing a lot for them that way.
That's another way of getting to the people.
If he continues like that, there's no trouble.
There's no trouble in the Shrine when he's there.
Everything's cool and organized.
Whereas with Fela, it was tough.
There were always problems there.
There were always problems.
Education doesn't work, hospitals don't work properly, people are poor, police aren't paid...
I mean, no security, life is totally a mess here.
The papers tell us a different story from the reality of our lives.
A lot of people are in pain here now.
Even me, I'm comfortable, but when you see so much poverty, how can you be happy?
After 40 years of independence, there is no area in Nigeria where you have light constantly, water running constantly.
And we call ourselves independent?
Independence means you're independent of asking for favors.
We can't say we are independent, because we are still relying on many things to keep our country going.
I wanna be free from all these yeye politics
I wanna be free from all these yeye politicians
I wanna be free from all these corrupt monsters
Because of the ideals of Femi Anikulapo-Kuti, he has always found a positive way to project the black man.
We believe in Black Power, and that we can be trusted.
We want to convey that Africans can mind themselves properly.
We want to do away with the myths in black mentality that the black man can't do what he wants to achieve.
We're trying to say things can work in Africa, if our leaders do the right thing.
But most of all, if no one can do that, we should free ourselves.
I think that Femi has found a better way to project this and continue Fela's hope to project the black image right.
To try to create another way to see that things can work in black Africa.
Wey want to chop man
The king is dead
Na dem kookuma kill the king For political reasons
Dem no fit talk as e be
Oya back to politics
Dem start to scheme For the same corruption and thief
No plan for you and me
When we dey sleep
Dey dem dey meet to plan their evil strategies
To control our resources
African leaders
And their foreign counterparts
E bi like from these evil monsters
We shall never be free
I wanna be free I said every day
Every night
I ask myself
Why, why, why
Chee because Fela die
That is why dem dey try to
Confuse I and everybody mind
Last Sunday, I had my beret.
It was stolen today.
What do they want?
- They stole my beret.
- Sanctioned.
What do you mean, sanctioned?
I told you they stole it!
Did you hear him?
I lent mine to him, over there.
They only gave me the shirt.
Isoko, anyone give you a beret?
He said he doesn't have it.
I'm wearing Michael's beret.
I had a beret, last week.
Each time we go out in this uniform we hear people yell:
"Femi's child!"
Or "the Shrine boys!"
They do recognize us as one of the "Shrine boys".
Fela, himself has already made the Shrine popular for all the Africans.
So when his son took over for him, people respect him like they respected his father.
When we put on this uniform we look as if we're close to Femi.
It's hard for people to see Femi, so when we wear this uniform, they say "this is Femi's security".
That's why we're proud to wear this uniform.
I'm proud to be working at the Shrine, I'll always be proud.
When I'm going home, a policeman will ask me:
"Where are you coming from at this hour of the night?"
I tell him I'm working security at the Shrine.
He asks if I have my ID card,
I tell him I don't have one.
This is the symbol of where I work.
As long as they can see this, they know that I work for Femi.
So they allow me to go.
If dem want to hear We go tell them plenty things
If dem want to see We go show them many things
Wey the African man Wey the African woman
Find it very difficult to succeed
Na today dem no say Mubotu no good
She na today dem no say company no good
See this African leaders
Dem don kill all their people finish
Look again Obasanjo don kill Nigerians
No not Obasanjo and his padi paddies
Dem dey try to give us different reason
To tell us say Obasanjo no guilty
Na today dem no say Charles Taylor no good
Na today dem no say Mugabe no good
My son Omorimade Afolabi Anikulapo-Kuti
See those African leaders Rolari
Dem don kill all their people finish
As we ought to know the reason why
The African man and the African woman find it difficult to su... Su...
Because you like to drink beer too much!
You like to suck breasts too much!
You'd like to be sucking pussy too much!
... Succeed!
With the dancing... with the dancing, the anger, the suffering you still find joy and peace.
We're letting so much frustration out of our system.
And all that is a language, without talking.
There is communication on that. I go to sleep,
I can wake up the next day, move forward without stress.
If my body's aching me or my girlfriend or...
Why do we need to have stress?
And I hope the people who come here have that same kind of vibe.
I mean, what is life?
To have peace of mind, know what to do the next day, how to deal with life.
So if the Shrine can do that to everybody, or anybody, I won't call it a church or mosque,
I'll just say it's life, Shrine.
I won't say God is here, God is not. God is here, but He's everywhere.
I will not go under the umbrella of religion, I'll make it spiritual. It's limitless.
I will not say:
"This is where to be", but "at least you can be".
Keyboard!
Yeah, I play the base guitar.
He plays guitar.
I dance on stage.
I play the shakers.
I'm a percussionist.
This is the band leader!
If I can take this country, then Africa is settled.
Once there's a good government in 1 country, they'll be liberated.
Only one straight, progressive clean government that knows what it's doing.
No diplomacy, no compromises,
and no Marxism-Leninism, no capitalism.
Africanism!
The time don come
For me to talk
Before I talk
Make I thank everyone
For the support You na give my family
During our troubles
You my friends Una dey with me Ninety-seven
I shall never forget
Ninety-seven The pain! The sorrow!
I want to thank you my friends
Jigbolo, Jijigbolo, Jigbolo!
Oh Yes I remember
The day all of us we gathered
To pay our respect to the
One and only Fela
We carry am go him house
Before him spirit go for Eledumare Palace I say
Together we walka
Carry Fela oh
For those wey no know Na that dey them know
Say the people Them love Fela oh
I've never seen anybody in this whole country or in all of Africa...
Only 2 people are walking the streets of power:
Nkrumah and my mother!
That's what I'm talking about!
All these dirty politicians who sit on their asses!
The young and the old The strong and the weak
The rich and the poor
Them gathered to carry Fela
And then as we want start to relax
We no know our problems
Just start From nowhere we hear
Cousin Fran just pass
Just like that she die
We start to wonder why
Enough is enough
The people start to talk
The problems don too much
Again as we start to relax and then suddenly we hear
Na the matter of my sister 'Sola Come make all of us weak for body
Again we ask ourselves why
For she was too young to die
As we dey cry Na so we dey try
We dey struggle to save her life
The doctors them dey lie
Them want to get money to survive
The thing wey dey pain me pass
Na the way she suffer before she died
Na so them dey cut Cut
Dey chook Chook Making Experiment with human life
Oh my sister 'Sola oh oh oh
Ninety-seven
Ninety-seven I shall never forget
Oh yes I remember
Music is the way for us. Music is the thing of the future.
Music is the weapon of the future.
Femi takes care of everybody, street boys, everybody.
We live okay here.
In Nigeria, only Femi takes care of everybody.
He's concerned about poverty, concerned about corruption, the poor...
In Nigeria he's a great man, Femi Anikulapo-Kuti, and he did many songs to let people know
So we have a lot of music to let you know what is going on in Nigeria and Africa.
Femi's making people know, and wants to know more.
If you want to know more, come to the Shrine.
He's like a prophet who has come to make people realize...
He's a prophet who makes people realize that they must fight for their rights, like one of his best tracks, Democrazy.
And now we realize that the government makes us mad, when you get mad, that's Shotan.
Shotan, it's like the destructive kid the mother didn't want to have.
That's what our government made us be.
But thank God, we have The Shrine, we have survival.
And we are ready to serve the true prophet.
- Not true?
We do something for ourselves!
We want to move further,
We want to go to university!
But our presidents only watch themselves, rule themselves. And the country's getting worse and worse.
Prices always go up, food, people are dying!
Food prices.
No light, no good education, no good nothing!
Mr. President, we're begging you!
We fight for our rights, man!
We're fighting together, doing something for ourselves!
For ourselves, for our lives!
Femi Kuti tells us how to think for ourselves.
Because some people are millionaires, while the country is going bad, bad!
The frustration is too much.
Sometimes when I'm walking I see the policemen beat people like dogs.
The policemen beat us like dogs.
Not true?
It's true, man!
The Afrika Shrine be my neighborhood
Every night, I'm there at Afrika Shrine
The ladies do as they like at the Shrine
Everybody does as they like at the Shrine
Every night they meet at the Afrika Shrine
Neighborhood
All Africans are my neighbors
The ladies like my neighborhood
The man we call Femi is a prophet.
We all serve him.
He's given us the message to keep the place clean.
We make sure it's clean.
We have found a survivor, we are pleased with him.
We are people from places like Ajegunle and Mushin, places where people go without eating.
We're here, we found survival with him.
We serve him.
That's why this place is clean.
If I leave for 5 minutes, this place will be messed up.
I must be here to make sure this place is clean.
So he'll be pleased with me, and I'll be happy he's pleased.
Bring me
Bring me the man now
I believe right now there's so much energy here.
And you can manipulate this energy for you.
My role is taking the energy of music and transforming it into dance.
If I achieve that, it's a force.
Music is a powerful force.
I take that sound, truly, not trickery or lies.
I take that energy and go pow...
And make people really go crazy.
People ask me how I did it, I don't know.
Because I do the right thing, that energy is using me as a medium to express many things through music.
Now that energy is a constant thing, 24 hours a day.
You can use that energy to understand, for many things.
Say you have a headache, somebody will be able to just touch your head, you'll feel a kind of ease because of the true love.
You take the energy: "You have a headache? Where?"
And that person will have calm.
I beg live me
No disturb me With nonsense gist
The fine things of life These people don't see
Their bad mind No gree make dem get better dream
With their crooked legs Dem walka go redem
But salvation comes from within
Seek and ye shall find
Definitely with music
Whose rich harmonies and melodies
Will truly bring peace
All in the name of peace
We fight and kill to find justice
For me na only music
From the voice of the soul we speak
Wetin concern me with English
Na dem koko greedy dem selfish
My sisters
They bank Africa money like the Swiss
Oyinbo don kill Africa finish
Femi, don't go!
The son of Fela "Baba 70".
I think it's the most challenging place to compose.
If the Shrine people love it, then I'm not worried, really.
I'm not really worried, because I'm very critical of myself. If I don't like it, if I don't feel something, I will not continue the work.
After the completion of the Shrine,
I found that I was alone, and I just saw myself sinking deep into music.
And on getting where I am in life, I found that the only friend I have, the only thing I can trust, is myself.
And it's difficult to really trust yourself.
You don't want to do something, then you do it.
The only thing I have confidence in, in my life, 100%, is music.
Even if you don't give your life to music, music will take you over.
So, I just let myself go and wherever music takes me, so be it.
I have no worries concerning that.
I'm not sad.
I mean, I have peace.
Sometimes I look annoyed, it's things around me, or things people said. I am a very happy man, very happy.
Sometimes I love being alone, I love being in my own world because this world is crazy.
I don't see anything in this world that makes sense.
You prefer to be alone?
I feel safer that way.
Don't forget, I'm not alone in that respect.
I have the force of music, running like a wild fountain in my head.
That alone, I am never at peace.
And I love the feeling music gives me.
I'll never compromise that, for nothing in this world.
Not even myself.
I will starve myself for music.
No way, can never give it up.
Out of the way!
May your future be bright!
Everywhere I go I see injustice
In government and our nonsense policies
Marxism, socialism, call it what you want
Capitalism all na the same oppression dey
Injustice, misuse of power na dem specialty
Pretending they want to help the human race 1, 2, 3, 4
Wetin dem dey wait for?
5, 6, 7, 8
Dem no say time no dey wait 1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6, 7, 8,
Dem just dey waste our lives away
The Shrine is the home of all things African.
I love Femi with all my heart.
Femi is a god in Nigeria.
Before dem get power Dem make promises
When dem get power Dem start dem conspiracy
Dem dey go dey bobo us, dem go dey post us
You see now time don go, election come again
In Africa we say only the lion borns the lion.
And if a lion borns a goat... there's a problem.
So, as the lion born the lion, the lion born the lion.
Hey, pay attention, Fuckers...
You stole that Wurlitzer from my shop.
The gay mafia are after me.
I need this cash!
I know where to find you jukebox, and the ass-clown who boosted it.
Someone wishes to buy this cursed business that haemorrhages money.
You're selling the dealership?
This place is Richard's dream, and the it's the only thing holding this family together.
Your dream lounge, the Summerwind?
You pinned all your hopes on the only emotion connection you ever had with Ken!
The song that he played for you as a baby!
Help us get out of here!
She is all yours now.
I am having this baby.
I'll drive!
Oh my gosh, do something!
Escape the country?
Good idea, Meghan.
No thanks, everyone.
Hello?
A lot of stupid shit goes through your mind when you're breaking out of prison.
But when the spotlight is on you and you've got your nuts in a vise, the only thing that matters is getting the fuck out.
Escape is a state of mind.
And there's no prison that Fitzy can't break out of.
Where the fuck's Houdini when you need him?
Oh, for the love of fuck, it's coming!
Don't worry, Miss Devon, we will get you to the hospital safe and sound and in time to witness this beautiful, miraculous....
I need motherfucking drugs.
I got some meth, but it's prison meth.
I got hash, and Oxy Contin.
Oxy?
I could use a hit.
Halfsies?
I'm the one in labour.
Try to hold off having the kid in the car, will ya?
It'll stain the leather and kill the re-sale value.
What the fuck are you doing?
Fuck, you don't have to have it in the ditch!
What haven't you done!
You're unemployed, you've never made it to any of the doctor's appointments, you're never around!
I broke out of prison!
When have you ever done anything in your life for anyone but yourself?
Okay, food for thought.
And since Richard is an escaped convict, maybe we can ponder this on the road.
Let's - Can we get a move on, please?
I will not let you smear your failure all over this baby.
Get out of my life, you fucking loser!
Don't leave me here with this crazy broad!
Richard, I know this is a trying time for us, but it's also an excellent opportunity to dig deep, and find out what's really going on here.
No, really, what's going on here?
She thinks I'm a loser!
No, I doubt that's true.
Did you hear me, Fitz?
You're a fuckin' loser!
I can't have my fucking kid thinking his old man is a loser!
Let's work on this in the car!
I have to get the dealership back from those two carbomb-istanis.
Let's figure out how to pay for that in the car!
You get her to the hospital, I'll take care of the dealership.
And evade the police?
Drive!
Find the closest motel!
Oh, I can handle this.
I told you the kid was a loser.
He's actually a winner now, sir.
Richard has decided to make the baby proud, and buy back the dealership.
The dealership?
You said you didn't want it.
You should be proud too, Ali, because you and the baby are having a positive effect on the Fitzpatricks.
That's my truck, man!
You can't keep me here, you know.
This is a men's prison.
It is clearly a violation of the, uh...
Geneva Convention.
And if I actually get violated, that's another violation.
So let me take a wild guess...
You just happened to be in the neighbourhood on the night that your brother and father broke out of jail?
No, stupid!
I was here because my stupid brother's stupid girlfriend was in stupid labour, so...
I'm up on tax evasion charges because of my dad's church scam...
By the power invested in me by the town of Coverton, I now declare you not guilty, okay?
They were headed back into town.
Daddy and Richard were fighting about the dealership,
Ali was all like, "I'm havin' a baby, I'm a fuckin' idiot!", so...
Aiding and abetting escaped prisoners.
We countersign when we get the money.
You get the $500,000 when you sign these documents.
Well, it would appear we are in the midst of a Mexican stand-off.
I blackmailed Elaine Fitzpatrick for her shares in this dealership.
If we did not need the money, never would I sell to that harpy!
They need both our signatures to sell, cousin...
And right now, she only has yours.
Swift thinking, cousin!
Once again, the Ruptals have tactical advantage.
Fitzpatrick Motors, currently run by the far superior cousins Ruptal.
Not for long, fucks.
I want to buy my dealership back.
I made a mint on that church scam.
It's the infirm Fitzpatrick!
He too wishes to purchase the dealership!
Haggle!
You know, foreplay, for you ethnics.
The flashing lights of opportunity dance around us, cousin!
We will sell the dealership twice!
Meet us at the DUI.
Bring cash.
Paco Vasquez.
I'm on my way to a costume party.
That's funny, Mr Vasquez.
You look an awful lot like an APB they just put out...
Look, officer, I'm just trying to do a little business here.
I got a buddy looking for you.
A real good buddy, if you know what I mean.
The gay mob.
Hey Fitzy!
I can see that orange jumpsuit from 5000 feet!
What the fuck, Josh?
Just here to get my stash, and I'm out of here, man.
Fuck, Josh, I need your help!
Bad timing, Fitzy.
I gotta get out of the country before I kill the Ruptals.
You leave now, your C.O.'s just gonna send someone else.
Oh God, you're right, they're doomed.
You gotta help me save 'em!
No, fuck that, Josh!
I'm an escaped fucking felon!
I gotta figure out how to get this shit palace back before my kid is born!
You think you work for the government, you'll figure something out!
Know what, I was a government agent!
And I'm not gonna kill the Ruptals!
I need you to help save those men!
Larry, I do not want to have my baby in a garage!
What the fuck, Larry, you're supposed to take her to the hospital!
The head...
The head!
Will someone call me a fucking ambulance?
Look, as I have explained - repeatedly - we can't risk involving the authorities!
Richard is an escaped felon!
Try to hold on until I get my place back.
Would someone just call me a cab?
You're a cab.
I'll call my own cab.
My kid is gonna have an old man that he can be proud of.
The contractions are four minutes apart.
Godspeed, Richard.
I gotta lie down!
Listen, for the love of kid, I'll help you.
But you've gotta promise me...
You promise me that when you talk to the Ruptals, you will not tell them that I have to kill them.
Give me the dealership, pronto, or Josh will have to kill you.
Josh, surely this is a joke.
Operation Blackout.
Terminate suspected terrorists
Ruptal Jhalalawan and Ruptal Jhalalatu.
With extreme prejudice.
It was nose hair clippers, okay?
I... I could never hijack a plane with nose hair clippers!
The feds have a file on you a mile thick.
C-4 in your stationary closet?
Or the jihad that you declared on Ken?
No, that was Fitz.
All this time, I was a mission?
Hey, wait... wait!
You were a mission...
Became a friend.
Bottom line is you're dead men if you stay here.
You sign over your shares in the dealership to me, I'll get you new identities, a ride.
We'll fake your deaths.
I have no doubt you're an expert in faking things.
We'll give you until midnight.
Listen, I -
Cousin, this is perfect!
By the time they uncover our treachery, we'll be.. "dead".
We sell the dealership three times!
Wish I were dead.
All right, you take care of the IDs, the car, and faking their deaths.
I'll get a burger.
Ruptal loved burgers.
With pickles.
[phone rings] Fuck.
Too late, shit bubble.
I just signed a deal with the Ruptals.
By midnight, the dealership will be mine.
The father/son dance I was gonna ask you to.
What the fuck do you think?
The gay mob nabbed me off Exit 9.
I need you to get my Wurlitzer from the storage unit.
And why should I give a fuck?
Because you helped this repressed cock-lover get it out of Florida.
That puts both of you on my shit list!
[cocks gun] That's not a list you want to be on, sugar.
Look, just get the thing, will ya!
I'll get your fuckin' Wurlitzer.
You're in no position to negotiate, slick.
I was talking to the half-sack.
I do this for you, you drop your bid for the dealership.
Larry, get me out of here...
Don't think of this as a garage, think of it as an automotive birthing station.
My child will be born in a crack den.
You couldn't put down some plastic first?
Don't worry, Ali Devon, I will find him.
Tell me you know something about delivering a baby because I have no fucking idea.
Let Uncle Joshy handle this.
For he has an earthquake kit.
Ali-bear!
It's Chester!
Look, I don't care what some DNA test or a restraining order says, I am that child's father, okay?
I massaged that belly, and I sang to that foetus, and I was the one who slept on the couch!
So give me a chance!
A chance to be the most attentive father in the world!
Well, it's official.
Chester Vince has been appointed vacated seat of disgraced councillor and felon at large, Richard Fitzpatrick.
Don't forget your friends on the air, Mr. Vi-
Sweet mother of Zeus! [tires squeal]
Didn't that twat farm ever throw anything away?
Don't worry, I left Ali with Josh.
I'm trying to show her I'm not a loser, and now Josh is the first face that kid is gonna see?
Oh, what's the fucking point?
The kid deserves better - not an old man who's a-
Don't you say it, Richard.
Because it is not true.
You are not the L word.
People do not depend on people who are the L word.
And right now, there are a lot of people depending on you, mister.
So you find your self-esteem, and we will find that jukebox.
You just have to dig a little deeper.
Is it a speech impediment that makes you always sound like a greeting card?
No, really, we just have to dig a little deeper.
Here we go...
Well, looky-looky.
Now what do you say we get a dilapidated Wurlitzer to a homicidal homosexual?
This thing is a piece of shit.
How come that fruit-cup has such a hard-on for it?
It's not worth 40 K.
It's gotta be some kind of scam.
That shit I said?
Fitzy's no loser.
I'm a fuckin' genius.
Headlamp, hand-cranked radio/flashlight, cyanide pills, uh... Glowstick!
It's like a rave in a bucket!
Ever since I was a little girl with a doll and a toy stroller, I didn't want kids!
I don't even like kids!
Let's see here, uh...
You've just survived an earthquake...
God, what was I thinking?
A single thirty-something mother, no husband, no prospects, not a single shard of self-respect!
I think I can see the baby!
He's got short, curly black hair in the shape of a lightning bolt.
It kind of looks like Harry Potter!
All you wanted was some fucking record?
Not just some record...
"The" record!
Bananarama's greatest hit?
Hey, watch your mouth, boy.
You're fucking with an antiques dealer.
And you asked for the Wurlitzer, so...
And it's a bitch to move.
Drive safe, Mr Vasquez.
If you're ever in Miami stay the fuck away from my shop.
See you later, old man.
I got a kid to make proud.
Not if I get there first.
We had a fucking deal!
Yeah, that's cheating!
No, it's Fitzpatrick!
$300,000, cash!
Josh has your new identities.
There's a van on the lot, gassed and ready to go.
And by morning, the government will think you're dead.
I'm talking real money here.
I've got something that'll blow the geezer's offer out of the water.
Did you ever hear of the legend of the lost Sinatra single?
Uh-uh. Only an idiot has not.
Well here it is.
Frank's lone shot at a rock 'n' roll career reboot.
He only had one single pressed.
Hated it, and had the master tapes destroyed.
But a technician hid the 45 in the one place he knew Frank would never look.
The Wurlitzer!
From the Sands!
You switched it out!
[snickering] [whispering] This is wrong.
If we continue this lie, we are no better than they are.
The only way you could beat the highest bidder, is by combining your offers.
In business with him?
No fucking way!
[gasp] Richard!
This is fate giving you a chance!
Look, for the sake of your child, and your grandchild -
I implore you as father and son, and mentor and servant, to finally bury this hatchet!
To work together!
To carry on tradition!
To shut me up!
I'll handle the paperwork!
You've got a baby on the way, buddy.
Somebody buy me a drink!
There's a mirror!
Oh, for the love of God, no!
All right, I did it!
I own this place now!
No, don't leave me alone with him!
I don't care what you own!
You are the last person I want down there!
This isn't my first pilgrimage to your promise land, baby.
Now, you do what you gotta do.
You did this to me, you son of a bitch!
I will kill you for this!
Yeah, anytime now.
I will cut off a limb for every stretchmark you gave me!
Good hustle!
Come on now!
I will shove a cinderblock up your asshole and make you shit it out!
Oh fuck... [baby fussing]
All this time I've been vilifying Fitz, but at least he's been running around trying to make you proud.
Besides the biological miracle of growing you inside me...
As per your request, Miss Devon, a taxi is en route to take you to the hospital.
Uncle Larry has just the thing to help get the little guy to sleep.
Your daddy's not a loser.
Your passports, birth certificates, driver's licenses, and library cards.
Oh, and uh...
I got you a little something as well.
Ruptal, listen...
I don't think I could ever forgive your lies, Josh.
Craven Moorehead would like to thank you for saving his life.
Your accent's gettin' pretty good.
You're a good teacher.
Ah, just so I know...
How will we die?
But I do know one thing.
It'll be a death worthy of a friend.
I'm also gonna need some teeth.
Uh, hi, Ali, it's me.
Uh, listen, I'm gonna be a little bit late for our future.
No matter what you heard.
They're gonna take me to the home world now.
But I'll be back soon, okay?
You need a drink?
Now you're speaking my language.
Congratulations, Richard, Ken.
A new partnership, and a new Fitzpatrick.
I know your relationship isn't where you want it to be, but we've got plenty of time to work on that.
Especially if we don't get thrown back into jail the second we walk out this door.
[chuckles] [sigh] Ah, cheers.
I get the big office.
Fuck that.
I built that place from the ground up.
The big office is mine.
Actually, it's mine.
A sales contract?
You bought the dealership?
Where'd you get the scratch to outbid us?
With the money I siphoned from the Ruptals' bank accounts.
Those oblivious idiots.
An unfinished contract means nada, Dot.
Only one signature.
Well... I still have Elaine's shares which makes us all partners.
Holy coincidence, or what!
Rest in peace, my Ruptal brother.
Larry, tell me you've been keeping up our insurance premiums.
You know it, buddy.
With that money, we can build a place twice this size.
Once again, everything works out for good old Fitzy.
Rat bastard.
You love when I take the whole thing in my mouth.
00:17:04,600 -- 00:17:06,100 I'm gonna cum for you, actually.
00:17:09,700 -- 00:17:10,700 I'm cumming in your mouth.
I just finished decorating my tree...
Think it looks really pretty and it matches my pretty outfit that I dressed up for you.
My boobs look really good...
Nice and big...
Do you like these gloves?
I think they're really sexy.
Also, I have a little surprise just for you.
See?
I'm wearing no underwear.
I think it looks really sexy with this skirt.
Do you like to watch them bouncing up and down?
So, let's see what Santa got me for Christmas.
Look what I got:...
Cute little pink toy to match my outfit.
Do you want to watch me play with it?
Get it all wet.
I love spitting on it.
Do you like watching me play with myself?
Oh, my God.
Tastes so good;
I wish you could taste it.
Do you want me to turn it on for you?
Hope you guys enjoyed that and happy holidays.
I landed my fashion dream job working for her,
Now I am juggling two secret lives, one in high school and one in high fashion.
Do you trust India?
I just think she's a little shady.
I'm afraid we have to say goodbye.
You did this to yourself, India.
You got the wrong person.
All right, fellas.
Here's how it's going down.
Are you robbing this place, Tommy?
A couple months at New Hall Youth Detention might give Mr. Nutter ample time to think about those mistakes and their implications.
I saw her with Nick.
They were kissing, Janey.
And you really deserve the perfect guy, Rita Shaw.
I really have no idea how to say this.
It's you, Janey.
You're gonna be late for school again, truant.
That guidance counselor of yours is gonna come down on you hard.
You know how Miss Shaw can be.
It's a little weird that you call your girlfriend "Miss Shaw."
Oh, you mean Rita.
Are you really that busy?
I'm nervous, Ben.
Two months is a long time.
What if he doesn't want to see me?
Jane. He was in a juvenile detention center, not a brainwashing camp.
You'll be the first person he wants to see.
Besides, why would anything be different with you two?
Well, the thing is I might not have told you everything that happened that night at the fashion show.
See, when Billy showed up he sort of...
Well, he...
Bated breath over here.
And would you like to tell me what that something was, exactly?
He said, "It's you."
"It's you, it's you, it's you." What do you think it means?
Well, I may be totally off-base here, but did you ever think he might have meant it romantically?
I did think that for a second.
But I don't think that's it.
But I guess it can be.
Maybe it is.
Would that be so weird?
Well, he's my best friend and I don't want to run the risk of ruining that, right?
- I can't answer that.
- Then what good are you?
Just go pick up Billy and you two will figure it out.
Because you guys are like this.
You can figure out anything.
I missed you, too, Janey.
Jane By Design 1x11
- The Replacement Original air date June 5, 2012
Yeah, I mean, I don't know what else to say.
It was pretty uneventful.
You were in a juvenile detention center.
So, was it scary?
Were the guards mean?
Did you make any friends?
Jane. Look.
I wasn't in Alcatraz or anything, okay?
I just...
I'd rather talk about something else, okay?
Maybe we should talk about, you know...
So, what about you?
What's been going on with that whole super secret double life of yours since I've been away?
Oh. Nothing, really.
- How's Jeremy?
Yeah, you guys are together, right?
We've never been together.
He doesn't even know that I'm in high school.
And we work together.
Speaking of work.
Well, things have been crazy ever since India got fired.
Gray has been using me for everything.
And she's been through at least a dozen people to fill India's job.
That's a lot of people.
And you should see the stuff that she's having me do.
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love being creatively involved at Donovan Decker...
Let's just say to be back here again.
And this place same way about me.
And, Billy...
Are we okay?
Shouldn't we, talk or something?
You've been talking non-stop ever since we got in the car, Jane.
I mean, about...
There's nothing for us to talk about, okay?
Unless you want to talk about that.
Lulu and Nick.
They've been an item ever since you left school.
Looks like it's just back to being the two of us.
Jane, I have to be honest.
This progress report does not reflect the academic performance of the Jane Quimby that I know.
Your grades are slipping in every class but ceramics.
Well, that's good, right?
- Your brother got an A in ceramics.
And it's not just your grades.
Your attendance last month?
Let's just say it was less than perfect.
This internship is interfering with your life.
Your grades aren't what they used to be, you have multiple tardies and absences and that just can't happen.
But I'm not just looking off into the future for my dream job.
I mean, I'm already here.
It's just an internship, Jane.
I'm working with designers and I'm being exposed to this whole world of fashion that you can't learn in a classroom.
I'm living it every day.
You can't buy that kind of experience, you know?
But I need to see some real changes.
Because if this doesn't improve, I can't sign off on the internship program for you next semester.
Especially if you're not...
Are you texting someone right now?
I am just typing a reminder to myself to shape up at school.
I promise I'll get things back on track at school.
I know this might sound harsh, but you've been an incredible disappointment, Sally.
Your work has been lackluster.
Your ideas, well, you simply have none.
In your time here at Donovan Decker, you've yet to show any real promise.
But I've only been working here for two days.
Two days too many, I'm afraid.
That's five this month, Gray.
Well, it's been harder to replace India than I might've realized.
Perhaps if you...
But I'm not worried.
I have a new prospect in mind.
Someone young and unexpected.
Someone not boxed in by years of design experience.
You're not talking about...
My next appointment is here.
Martyn!
Gray, darling!
So. Classic.
Clean.
Powerful.
It's a whole new delicious look to match your title of Creative Director.
Girl, how many hats does Gray have you wearing right now?
More than you own.
Am I the only one that's twice as busy since India left?
I think we're all starting to feel the pressure.
But you more than anyone.
'Cause whenever Gray says jump...
I say, "Over whom?" And, "In pumps or flats?"
I just really hope this new girl works out.
Well, don't get your hopes up.
What can I do for you, muffin?
That's a "no" on kissing at work and the whole muffin thing.
It didn't quite feel right coming out.
I need the kids here to respect me, Ben.
We need to be professional.
We're on the same page.
I had a conversation with Jane this morning.
I'm just a little concerned.
She's good with it.
- With what?
- With us dating.
No. Ben. I'm concerned about Jane.
I just got her progress report and she's falling behind.
I think this internship is just too demanding on her, don't you?
Actually, I kind of think it's been good.
But I promise I'll make sure she stays focused on school.
Because your love life depends on it?
I know you've all been working tremendously hard lately.
But you're gonna have to work tremendously harder.
Donovan Decker has been selected to collaborate on a capsule collection with one of the world's most famous luxury department stores,
Harrods.
That is, unless we blow it.
And we cannot blow it.
Didn't I fire you?
See me in my office afterwards.
The style director assigned to oversee our Harrods collection will be coming by tomorrow.
Now, can anyone tell me what is our number one priority?
Um, to impress the style director and ensure Harrods is confident that Donovan Decker has what it takes?
Now, I need all hands on deck for the next two days.
If that is clear, then walk away and get back to work.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
As long as Gray doesn't see.
Because apparently, we're all supposed to be working tremendously harder than we were before.
Did you hear that she fired Sally?
- Do you mean Suzy?
I'm turning into Gray, aren't I?
- Not that that would be a bad thing.
- I just think... What?
I'm going to tell you something and I need you not to react, okay?
I'm serious, Jane.
Gray is giving you India's old job.
Take over India's job?
I am so not ready for that.
Then you best get ready.
I'll be out in a minute!
- Morning, Miss Shaw.
You mind handing me the milk?
Oh, and Miss Shaw?
Yes, Billy?
I think your toast is ready.
You're actually considering this?
I mean, taking India's old job would be the opportunity of a lifetime.
You'd really consider leaving here?
Just leaving school behind?
Talk to me, Billy.
Oh, you're good?
- So, now you're mad at me?
Billy, you've been shutting me out.
And how can I help if you won't even talk to me?
For starters, how about the fashion show?
You ran out before we could even have a conversation.
It was nothing, Janey.
Look, I was in a bad place.
I was getting sent away.
There's nothing for us to talk about.
It means you have changed.
And, if you ask me, it's not for the better.
I didn't ask you, Jane.
Then be that way!
- I will!
- Well, then do it!
I said I will!
Maybe I took your advice and I tried to talk to him about the whole "it's you" thing and maybe it backfired.
I'm worried about Billy.
It can't be easy for him to fall back into his old life here.
Well, maybe you could help him find something positive to focus on?
I don't know, maybe an activity or something?
Like mathletes.
Or chess club.
- I'm being serious, Rita.
Chess?
Mathletes?
What, do you want him to be more of an outcast?
Those are terrible clubs.
I was in those clubs, Ben.
And you were adorable doing it.
Vice Principal Jenkins!
What a surprise to see you!
Where we work.
What're you naughty kids up to this fine morning?
Naughty?
Why would you even...
We are... Were...
I said "mop"!
- And I'll stop talking now.
Good morning, Jenkins.
Really awkward.
You said you want to keep it professional at work, right?
- Do you think he knows?
About you and me, of course.
How would he know that, Ben?
We ooze chemistry.
Don't say ooze.
Oh, you know how it is, just trying to get my bearings back.
So, what's been going on with you?
So, you and Fadden, huh?
How's that one working out for you?
To be honest, I thought it was going pretty well.
That is until you got back.
I thought I could forget about us, b...
There is no more us, Lu.
But I really do hope things between you and Nick work out.
Because you deserve it.
You're precipitating.
- Your calcium is starting to form a precipitate.
You should dry out the crystals.
- Busy, huh?
You're not gonna cut me any slack here, are you?
I'm really sorry, Jane.
For what it's worth, I made a big mistake.
Huge, in fact.
Really, I'm just distracted.
I think it all worked out for the best.
You and Lulu seem very happy.
Yeah, it's just, um...
You wanted to see me, Ben?
Good hands.
First day back.
I'm fine, Ben.
This must be the part where you ask me how I'm adjusting.
No, I just thought now that you're back, you might want to hit the ground running.
Find a positive outlet.
I don't know, something to keep you busy.
Focus your energy.
How about football?
You got a pair of hands on you.
I mean, you're a little stringy, but you're probably very elusive.
Hard to tackle.
Why not just give it a shot?
Look, Ben.
I appreciate you trying to help reacclimate me or whatever it is that you're trying to do here.
But, in case you hadn't noticed, I'm not really the team sport type.
Are you sure you're doing okay?
Because, Jane told me about...
Do you really want to do this, Benjamin?
- I'd prefer if we didn't.
I have to leave school because of an emergency at work and Rita can't know under any circumstances because then I would lose my internship and that can't happen.
So I really need you guys to help me out okay?
Can you cover for me?
Look, I know that you are mad at me and that you don't really like to do this sort of thing, but can't you just cover for me?
Maybe like a cold, cramps, anything.
I don't like lying to Rita.
It's just a teeny-tiny little white lie.
And that's how it all starts.
Hey, I'm actually a little lost.
Oh, well, maybe I can point you in the right direction.
Who are you delivering those to?
You think I'm a flower delivery guy?
A second ago.
But now I'm a little unsure.
They're for Gray Chandler Murray.
Oh. Great.
I'm Gray's assistant.
So I can just take those to her.
I'd rather give them to her myself if that's okay.
The thing is Gray's not exactly the hand delivery type.
What type is she?
She's more of a "don't bother me with that kind of crap" type.
So, if you're not the flower delivery guy, who are you?
I have an appointment with Gray.
No, it's tomorrow.
I just thought I'd get here early in case I got lost.
Why would you get here a whole day...
- You didn't laugh.
Well, it wasn't laugh out loud funny.
The thing is Gray doesn't have any appointments today.
Well, she called me directly.
Called you?
So, what is this appointment about?
Something about a job opening.
A job.
And you're interviewing for it?
Are you gonna point me in the right direction or should I...
So, you got any tips for me?
Yeah, you know, like advice for the interview.
Oh, um, just don't take anything Gray says to you personally.
She can be a little cold.
So, you're saying she's mean?
- She's just not very...
- Nice?
Eli, you're here!
And you brought me flowers.
Yeah, well, I haven't seen you in a while.
And I know lilies are your favorite.
Jane, I see you've met my nephew, Eli.
Jane was actually just talking about you.
Oh. And what did she say?
Only that you're warm and gorgeous and incredibly talented.
Eli, come into my office.
Jane, hold all my calls.
It was nice to meet you, Jane.
His name is Eli.
I don't like the look of him.
Well, you should probably keep that one to yourself.
Because he is Gray's nephew.
And from the looks of it, he might also be India's new replacement.
Something you want to add?
Spit it out, Jane.
I feel a little silly saying this, but for a second there I thought that I was in the running for India's job.
My sister, Jane?
Your sister Jane.
I heard she went home early.
And right after I had that talk with her.
Did you know about this?
Yes. I am aware of her departure.
She said some things about cramps.
Cramps.
Cramps. You know, lady stuff.
I'm not that familiar with lady stuff, so I'd really rather not discuss it.
Hello, Miss Shaw.
I heard Jane went home.
All right, peace.
White chocolate half-caff latte.
And I picked up the tear sheets that you wanted this morning.
And I got you a reservation tomorrow night at Per Se.
I thought you said they were booked up for the next two months.
They are. I pulled some strings.
Well done, Jane.
And I thought you might like to take a look at these.
- Some sketches.
Of mine.
Just some new ideas for the accessories line.
Yeah, Gray said I should stick around a while and check out the place.
You asked if you could ask me something.
Technically, that is a question.
Sometimes you are way too British.
There's no such thing.
Okay, come on, I'm serious, Jeremy.
At your service, Miss Quimby.
Okay, so about this whole job offer thing.
Do you really think it's a good idea?
In what respect?
Well, in that I'm an assistant.
And the closest I've come to studying design is, I don't know, the endless hours I spent and fashion magazines every weekend.
This is a huge job.
Why would Gray trust me to handle something like this?
Eli seems way more qualified and he's...
He's nothing to worry about.
You have to run your own race, Jane.
And you, you've got what it takes.
Plus, you deserve it.
I just really don't know if this is the right thing for me right now.
I have a lot of stuff going on at home.
My best friend was away for a while and now he's back and...
Is this the same friend from the fashion show?
Isn't he the reason you turned me down?
Jeremy, we've talked about this.
You're my mentor and my friend.
No need to rub it in.
All I'm saying is I don't know if it's the right time to leave him...
To leave him behind.
That is why he was so upset.
I'm not really following your chain of thought here.
Oh, it's nothing.
Thank you for all of your help.
One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand...
- What's going on with you?
I was parched.
I'm trying to keep things discreet.
You're lying to me about Jane.
Billy said she has a cold.
- You said she had cramps.
I have to go to the house to check on Jane.
You've got me really worried about these cold cramps.
That's a great idea. I'm going with you.
And if Jane isn't home sick in bed, that internship of hers is over.
- You have to get Jane home!
The collective brain power of you and me.
You said cramps, didn't you?
There's no time for blame.
Yes. I said cramps.
You just couldn't stay out of it, could you?
I told Rita that I was going home to check on Jane, and now she's coming with me.
So Jane has to be home, in bed, sick, and fast.
I thought we were staying out of it.
Can't you just call her?
I've called her like a dozen times.
It keeps going to voicemail.
Ben, it's just the whole racing to save Jane thing, it's not really my problem anymore.
Look.
I'm not happy about this either, and I know you two are going through some sort of weird time right now, but she needs us.
Otherwise this whole fashion dream thing of hers is out the window.
I can't bring myself to do that to her.
Can you?
I can't compete with this guy.
She's not going to hire her nephew.
Look, I didn't go to school for design.
And I know my technique isn't exactly refined like the rest of you extremely talented people.
But, given the chance, I might be able to bring something new to the table here at Donovan Decker.
Something fresh.
Now I heard that you're already selling your own line, is that true?
I do what I can.
Mostly, right now I'm just selling my stuff at pop-up shops or on the street.
Honestly, the money I make barely covers materials, but I love it.
And that's what it's all about.
Yeah, I think so, too, Carter.
He's charming and talented and good-looking
He's not that good-looking.
I'm serious, Jeremy.
There's no way I actually have a chance of getting this job.
Not if I'm up against a guy like that.
Please. It's a courtesy, Jane.
A family obligation.
This is Gray we're talking about.
She's not going to actually hire anyone she has to be nice to.
Yeah, I'm always right.
You said we were leaving to check on Jane 20 minutes ago.
And we are.
I just have to grade a few more of these puppies and we are on our way.
Ten minutes, Ben.
And then we're going.
And if I find out you are lying, we're gonna have a serious issue.
I'm pleased to announce that I have found the perfect person to fill the vacancy left by India Jourdain.
This person has proven that they have exceptional creativity and style.
This person is destined to be a rising star here at Donovan Decker.
This person is...
Can't?
I'd like to take myself out of the running.
I'm so sorry, Gray.
I really am grateful.
I don't think I'm ready for this.
Which is why I'm pleased to introduce our newest designer,
Eli Chandler.
Billy, what are you doing here?
- We need to get you home.
Ben said cramps, didn't he?
Yeah. You know your brother doesn't think fast on his feet.
And now Miss Shaw is on her way to your house to visit your sickbed.
What do you think's faster right now?
5th or Lex?
We're gonna have to...
And I'm not gonna let that be for nothing.
We have to get you home. Now.
Jane, I'm on my way to the house.
I've stalled as long as I can and I just can't keep lying to Rita.
Your chariot awaits.
- Oh, this is a shortcut.
Come on, Janey!
Pajamas!
Maybe we should just let her sleep a little bit.
Oh, hey guys.
I'm feeling much...
I just have a cold.
And cramps.
So I just needed to...
Double whammy.
Hmm. Well, feel better, okay, Jane?
Thanks, Miss Shaw.
- I'm sorry, Ben.
For the whole manhunt thing.
Coming down on you.
Honestly, I feel terrible for questioning you, accusing you of lying.
I don't know what got into me.
I think you're just being the best guidance counselor in the history of guidance counselors, that's all.
That was far, far too close.
And how about me turning down that job that I wasn't even being offered?
So embarrassing.
Okay, it was pretty bad.

Get in the car! Who are you?
The VAT man.
Well done on bringing us the money. Welcome to Morocco.
Help! HELP! For your own sake, I suggest you answer these questions truthfully.
Why are you on this boat?
That's... er... That's all of us going on a fishing trip.
I remember that day... happy times.
You are putting a bag in the car. What was it?
Probably fishing gear.
Bax?
Quinn?
Tell me about this, please.
Where did you learn how to do this?
What is happening here?
That's... that's just lads on holiday, innit?
You know, things get a bit out of control.
Who are you?
Where are my friends?
You all OK?
They... shaved me. And they bust my new glasses.
Where are we?
Said Morocco, didn't they?
Yeah, I know that. But where?
Did they show you the pictures?
What pictures?
What do you say to 'em Rick? Nothing.
Obviously. Don't tell them anything, all right.
Not until we get some kind of legal representation. Someone from the embassy - Amnesty or someone. How you gonna get in touch with them?
Who are they anyway?
They're some kind of militia or something, aren't they?
He was wearing a shirt, with a Marks and Spencer's label on. I saw it sticking out.
Who? My interrogator. I mean, extremists...
They might.
Shall we go and help him?
Best not to get involved.
You all right, mate?
It's a woman. Serious. It's a bird!
Argh! I was just trying to see if you were OK. I'm Quinn.
What sort of fag name is that?
Dunno. Ask my dad. Named after my grandfather, I think.
I'm Mercedes. Hi.
- Your dad into cars then?
- Heard of the Count of Monte Cristo, dumb fuck?
Yeah... no... yeah - fuck, I dunno, I can't remember.
Can I just ask, what's with all the rough stuff?
It's what they do if you don't tell them what they want. Who are they?
A bunch of COCKSUCKERS! Come on! Do you have any idea how we might get in touch with someone from the British Government?
Yeah, it's easy. They're in there. Eh?
It's the Foreign Office. Sorry. What is this place exactly?
A week ago, I was standing in line, holding a tuna baguette, queuing up for easyJet. Now I'm being fucking renditioned!
"Dear God, please help me see danger coming my way, "and forgive the body count I will be sending your way."
"Never pick up a dead man's gun." "I... "..heart...
You think they'll care about that? They still have to abide by them.
Woody, this is our government. Governments can't just hold us indefinitely for no reason. What you on about?
Course they can! They do it all the time. You remember those plane spotters in Greece?
They said they were spies. And what about Guantanamo?
Nobody even knew who was in there. Get off! Come on!
All right?
How did you end up here then, love?
I was in Kabul, "love".
You in the army then?
No, I went there because I like the opera.
Didn't like what I saw, so I went AWOL. Took a long fucking walk. Posted some things on the web.
How long do they usually keep people in here for? As long as they want. That's the point.
Fellas, can I... have a word? In private.
This could be a trick. She could be working for them.
What, you not talking to me now?
I ain't the enemy. Anyway, if I wanted info out of you, I'd just.... ..beat it out of you.
Ever had a cauliflower ear, Quinn? Or a wet willy?
You know what Churchill said?
Fuck off!
"If you're going through hell, keep going".
Put our time to good use. Only trying to help, knobhead. Well, you're not.
So, what, do you think it's somehow harder for you, Quinn?
I don't think anything, Bax. Because I'm stuck in an illegal prison in the middle of the Sahara fucking desert. And why am I here?
Yup. Here we go. Here we go.
Nice toughing it out guys.
Oi, Quinnbo, you know there's no "I" in team, don't you? No. But there's a "U" in "fuck you".
Stop it! Get off! Get off me!
Help! Get off! What's happening?
Please, don't. Let go! Where are you taking him?
Leave him alone! BAX! Get your hands off him, you slags!
I watched the door all night to see if he'd come out. Yeah, me too.
Shit, no... Come on. Let's not think the worst.
Hiya. I think there's more grub on the side. Just help yourself.
We've been worried sick. You've been gone all night. What happened?
I dunno... weird. They asked me a bunch more questions and suddenly it was all, you know, tea and toast.
You should get some. Come, please. Oi!
Sit.
Fortunately for you... ..we're not actually interested in what you did over the last few days.
All we wanted to know was who you were financing. We weren't financing anyone.
We were just trying to get home. With five million euros?
We have at our disposal DNA databases, forensic analysis, satellite imaging technology. If that doesn't give us what we need, we employ enhanced interrogation techniques.
If we want to find out the truth, we do. And now, we have.
We made a mistake. It happens. So...
Just sign these and we'll get you to the airport and on a flight.
Hang on. Does that mean that we can...? Please don't ask if you can keep the money.
Do you want us to do anything for you, back home?
Little candle-lit vigil?
Coloured rubber wrist bands - "Free Mercedes".
Take care.
Mrs Peters. 101 Bridge Road, Crawley. It's my mum. Just let her know I'm all right.
You take care of yourself.
Seriously?
Did you really think we were going to get out of there?
Two nights in. Nah... thought that was it.
What went through your mind?
Well, first of all, my kids... Carmen, and then just like, stupid stuff, like... I thought I'd never get to see United play again.
They might wonder why four grown men went on holiday together, saying they were going to Spain and actually ending up in Morocco.
If anyone so much as mentions "bad luck", they're walking. Be a long walk back, pal, we've been driving for nearly an hour. Haven't seen so much as a camel.
He's gone.
He's not coming back, is he?
Two stay, two go and get help. Shouldn't we all go? Why?
Or stay? We'll double our chances if we split. Halve them you mean.
I do. I do. I do.
I'll go. Come on. You two stay here, if the driver comes back, just all stay with the car, all right?
Do you believe in destiny, Bax? No.
So shut up.
Fate then?
Rick, please. No destiny, no fate, no karma, no spells, no curses.
This is just a series of misunderstandings, OK?
Could have happened to anybody. No more, no less.
Who's...?
Come on!
Get in. You are about to be shot, get in!
Bax, get in.
Woods! Quinn! Hey!
- We had some disturbing intel. - Well, if it's bad news can you just lie to me?
Your man in Majorca... ..has operated successfully for so long because he gives huge kickbacks to the American security services. What?
He's paying the CIA to protect him?
Not really new news. Why would they want to kill us?
One of you tipped off the authorities in the UK. A contact inside Customs and Excise.
This goes higher than us. This kind of thing brings down governments. Iran Contra anyone?
The CIA? No.
They'd have tasked local contractors. So nothing can be linked back to them. You got lucky...
But this isn't going to go away. OK, let's get practical, then. So what are the options?
Well, there must be something?
Then I'm afraid you're on your own. How long would this be for?
Maybe for ever.
- We can never go home?
- It's the only offer on the table.
No, no, no, that's... That's not an option.
No. I'm going home and... If you go back, you'll be putting your families at risk as well.
OK, let me just see if this is even logistically possible.
Stand up. Get up.
Amy... Yeah, I know, I'm sorry that I haven't rung.
Listen to me for a second, love. Nina... Just stop, just let me talk, darling, OK?
Where are they?
..because that is not what's happened. I've met someone.
No, no, everything's fine. It's just... I think I'm going to stay out here a little longer.
Well, what happened to your satellite dish?
I can't hear you Rachel, say that again.
Take care?
Yeah, OK. I will. You too.
Fuck... No, no, you're right, I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't swear. Dad, listen to me, OK?
You've been brilliant, Dad.
Yeah, just take care. Yeah... I love you, Dad.
I know you all think it's my fault, don't you? You think it's my fault because I phoned the VAT man.
It's nobody's fault, Rick. It's just... I don't know, the universe conspiring against us or something.
A fly saved my life. What?
Any idea where we're going yet?
Is that a don't know, or won't say?
What you going to call yourself?
What do you mean?
Your name.
We can't use our own names right?
Hey... I'm gonna be Floyd. That's what I'm gonna call myself.
You can't call yourself that. Why?
It's a black name. Is it?
It's like calling yourself... Everton or Tyrell, or something. You can't.
Tony Smith. My name's Tony... Smith.
If I was a girl, I'd call myself... ..well, Hope. You could be Bob Hope. New hope.
New house.
Jamie.... Jamie Kirk, then. Blake...
Tony Smith, Adam Newhouse, Jamie Kirk and... ..Blake Hatch. Hatch. Welcome to your new fucking lives.
South Africa.
We're on the other side of the world. Do they speak English here?
Uh... I think so. What's it like?
I don't know. This will all sort out, won't it?
How do we get in touch with you?
You don't. Right, OK. - How do we keep in touch?
- You won't be able to. It's too dangerous. Hang on a minute.
What happens if it's safe for us, if it becomes safe for us to go home, to break cover? How will we know that?
As far as anyone else knows now, you don't exist. That's your best chance of surviving. If you want to stay alive, stay invisible.
The truth will come out though, won't it? In the end. OK, let's go.
Say your goodbyes. Come on, move this thing along. Come on, people.
Take care of yourselves.
Woody.
Hey, we shouldn't be on our own. Listen, I know I said some things... ..but you boys mean a lot to me, all right? And you always will.
Quinn, Quinn, come on. Guys, come on, we should stay together, yeah? We're a team now.
Right, boys... Chin up. At least we're still standing, eh?
You'll be all right, Bax. What makes you say that?
You're smart. I'm not that fucking smart.
Hey. What about if just me and him, we stick together?
- It'll be all right, won't it? - No. - Listen, nobody has to know.
You'll be all right. I can't do this Woody. Yes, you can.
You're strong, mate. You're stronger than you think. No, I'm not.
Woods, let's not do it, yeah? You and me, we'll stay together, yeah?
Woods... Woody... Woody, let me go with you, yeah?
Please, Woody. Woody, let me come with you, please. Hey!
Woody... Woody, I don't want to be on my own! Woody, please.
Woody, mate. Don't leave me, please. Woody!
I know every disgraced politician, every gem smuggler, every high-stakes gambler and gold digger that come through those doors. Why you never go away?
You don't even leave Cape Town. If you love her so much, why don't you marry her? Yeah, why don't you marry me and take me to England?
Your name isn't Newhouse is it?
How dare you, and how dare you try and blackmail me!
Help!
Previously on Siberia... (Indistinct shouting)
A fucking tiger!
It was like something a seven year old would tell me...
"Oh, I saw a tiger in the woods..."
- Wondering what would do that to a tiger.
It's on fire...
and it's green...
- What's on fire?
You know, there's something about Carolina.
I feel like I recognize her.
- Fire in the woods, man.
- (Man) Got to get some water.
I told you this was a mistake!
That's all we had, man.
That's all we had.
Does anyone recognize this?
We found Johnny's shirt.
And it was full of food from the shed.
(Johnny) I get what it looks like.
But I didn't steal the food, and I didn't burn down the shed.
Someone obviously doesn't like me, and they're trying to set me up.
Someone framed me.
They wrapped my shirt around some food, hid it in the woods.
I don't know who did it.
You know, frankly, I don't really care anymore, you know?
I don't really need them anyways.
You know, obviously, I can take care of myself.
Took them how long to build a fire?
I did it in five minutes in the dark.
(Daniel) I can't believe
Johnny's gonna just stay out in the woods.
And why shouldn't he?
After all the crap that he's pulled?
And if he's not, you got a better chance of winning.
And you can keep his bed.
I want to make it to the end, but I want to do it as a team, kind of like how Neeko's doing it, you know?
Can I tell you something?
(Daniel) Sure.
You're a smart guy.
You know that Neeko is a professional athlete?
He plays game for living.
How about maybe he's playing this game that he's a very nice guy, everybody trusts him, just to win the game?
Have you ever thought about it?
I don't think you should trust him.
(Sam) Can't trust anybody.
I get up early, and as soon as I open the door, I practically ran into this spear that's stuck in the ground.
It felt like a threat.
(Woman) What does it say?
It says... (Speaks Russian)
(Woman) What is that?
It means "get out."
It's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell's going on here.
It's a nice prop.
Nice scare tactic.
I'm sure they're loving this.
(Woman) Why is it in front of our cabin and not yours?
Who wants you guys to get out?
(Man) Well, this is here on purpose.
It's here on purpose.
It's here for a reason.
You guys gonna be so gullible to fall for this, really?
(Daniel) Who else could've left that spear?
Besides Production, who could've done it?
We're the only people out here.
I mean, aren't you still scared?
The spear this morning telling us to leave?
That doesn't scare you at all?
I think, at this point, it's just all mind games.
I miss home.
I even miss my stupid ex-boyfriend.
This place is-- it's getting to me.
I'm thinking about pushing the button.
I think-- I think we can win this.
We just need to--
But I don't need to stay.
I don't understand why I'm even staying.
I don't need the money that badly.
(Sam) I've been a lone wolf for a while, you know?
I've been on my own for a while.
I'm probably, without knowing it, less lonely than I have been in a long time because I'm interacting with people more often than I have in many years.
Now I consider Daniel a friend.
If I had a son, I'd be proud if he was like Daniel.
- Just watching those two.
(Daniel) I don't want to overstep my bounds, you know.
I don't know how she feels about me, and so I'm just kind of--
I'm taking it slow, but at the same time, it's really hard 'cause I really want to, you know, see where this is gonna go.
At the same time, I don't want to get hurt.
Don't worry.
She knows you exist.
How would I really get her to?
I don't know, like...
Get her to what?
Like me like me.
You can't get her to like you.
Either she does or she doesn't.
How beautiful is it?
_
_
I'm being naughty.
It's beautiful in, though.
_
You must be hot.
- No good... _
- It's trouble.
You want to come.
_
You'll thank me once you're in here.
_
I'm gonna film us.
_
(Laughs) It's a great idea.
You promise you'll erase it?
_
You shouldn't be walking out here alone.
_
Come on, it's not safe.
Don't be like this.
Look, I-- (Sighs)
It's not the same thing for me, okay?
But you're forgetting about who's here for you right now, and you're turning your back on me.
(Annie) I like her.
It's been a while since I've been with anybody, but I--
We get along so well.
I just feel like a dumbass now.
I mean, she's probably not gonna talk to me for the rest of the time, if she does stay.
- (Irene) Hey.
- There you are.
- (Irene) How's it going?
Um, so, Victoria's gone.
Um, I'm just wondering what's going on with her bed.
Oh, it's-- well, it's free right now.
So no one would mind if I moved in?
Um... yeah, yeah.
I mean, I don't mind.
I don't know what the other girls other think, but it's good with me.
(Esther) Awesome.
All right, I'll go grab my things.
It's not that I didn't have fun with the boys.
I just feel like my time there is done.
It's served its purpose, and I want to--
I want to get to know the girls a bit better.
- (Miljan) Hey.
- (Miljan) What are you doing?
You mean the show?
(Esther) (Laughs) No, you idiot.
I'm gonna move into Victoria's old bed.
Because it's free.
(Miljan) I know, but I thought you liked it here with me.
You said we are great roommates.
Yes, we were, and thank you for letting me stay.
Just, I don't know.
I want to be with the girls now.
Come on, Esther.
Don't you think we should team up?
(Esther) (Laughs)
We are both smarter than everyone else here.
We can win this thing-- together.
Ohh, I like your style.
But hold on.
I was just thinking that we could have something... (Esther) You thought what?
That we could get romantic a little bit?
(Esther) (Laughs)
(Miljan) Don't laugh.
I don't do romance.
Look, we're playing a game.
(Miljan) What do you mean?
(Esther) I'm playing a game-- for money.
I don't do romance, and I'm not playing a dating game.
You're not going anywhere.
(Miljan) I'm kidding.
(Laughing) I was just kidding, Esther.
(Esther) Don't you fucking touch me again.
(Miljan) Come on! I'm just-
- I was just kidding!
(Esther) I think I was in shock.
But he grabbed me here, pushed me up against the bunk, and then he backed off.
(Miljan) Esther is a player.
And I played with her, too.
So she was on the way out.
I just pushed her a little bit on the bed, just jokingly, like pretending that I'm like scaring her.
"You're gonna stay here," or something.
She just, like, freaked out.
She's like, "don't talk to me like that."
Stormed out, like mad.
And I was just telling her, "I'm joking.
You know me. I always joke around.
I was just joking with you."
I didn't get it, seriously.
She just freaked out, and it was just a pure joke.
What are you showing me?
(Carolina) Are you sure?
(Neeko) Big huge carcass.
Guts hanging out and everything.
It could've been anything.
It could've been a bird. It could've been a deer.
(Neeko) Why would I make this up?
There was a huge-- there was a huge tiger there.
I guess they took it.
The producers took it.
The producers?
I think she thinks that I could've been trying to scare her, play a sick joke on her.
I was kind of a bit shocked because I didn't think she saw me as that kind of person.
For all I know, Johnny took it.
(Carolina) Johnny took it?
He probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something.
(Carolina) Oh, now Johnny does everything?
Not only do we have to worry about the producers playing mind games with us, we got to worry about that guy.
Hopefully he's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here.
I don't think he's as bad as you think.
Why are you always defending him?
I'm telling you that guy's dangerous.
You need to watch yourself!
I'm kind of baffled where it's gone, you know, 'cause this thing was pretty big, you know.
It would've taken a lot of force or something pretty hefty to get it out of there, and there was no trail.
There was no kind of like a trail of where it could've been dragged to.
It's like it was almost picked up and gone.
Got some traps set up along this way somewhere.
I found some deer trails I scouted earlier.
Hope they catch something.
The first night in the woods by myself was pretty awesome, actually.
Had a nice little fire.
Weather was nice.
You know, wrapped up.
It was nice being on my own.
What the hell did this, man?
This thing's...
I mean, it, obviously, it ripped the deer while it was standing here.
It was strong enough to rip it off-- rip the, like, rip its bone in half.
(Crack)
What are you doing?
(Johnny) I'm trying to catch some food, but something got to it before me, it looks like.
I just came to try to convince you to come back.
(Johnny) Try to convince me to come back, to the camp?
Yeah, I don't think it's safe for you to be out here.
I think it's safer here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don't like me thanks to you, making those wild accusations.
Just, whatever happened, I don't think it's safe for you to stay out here.
I really don't need you trying to be nice to me.
I'll be fine on my own, okay?
I can take care of myself.
Y'all try taking care of yourselves, too, all right?
(Carolina) Okay, fine.
If that's how you want to be, then fine.
(Johnny) Fine.
Nah, that's-- that's not good enough.
That ain't good enough.
(Daniel) Hey, Irene.
Whatcha doing?
Collecting some acorns.
If you mash them up, you can make like a paste and make a pancake out of it.
Is it-- does it taste good?
You want me to help?
That'd be great. Yeah.
They're kind of scattered all over.
Daniel is a really, really nice, really sweet person, and he has such a gentle-- a very gentle spirit,
I guess you can say.
It's a Siberian squill.
(Irene) I'm not really big on flowers.
It never really made sense to me.
Something more permanent would be nice, you know, even a rock would be better.
(Daniel) She's got so much complexity to her, you know?
I find out something new about her every day, it seems like, and it's a pretty big thing that I would've never expected out of her.
It's... (Chuckles)
She's just-- she's amazing.
(Both chuckle)
Where are we?
I can't find the path.
- We're not lost.
- No, we're lost.
I don't know where we're going.
(Miljan) In the middle of the wood, very close to the river,
I found this really weird-looking tree.
I mean, it wasn't a tree.
It was something different.
It had a face shape.
It had hair.
My name is Miljan.
It's really nice to meet you. (Chuckles)
Ogdee?
This is my friend Ogdee.
We go way back, man.
He's so bad.
I spoke to it.
We had a little conversation.
Ogdee is my old friend from high school.
- (Man) Esther.
(Esther) Hey.
Where do you go all day, anyway?
(Whispering) Okay.
I can't believe you got us so lost.
Yes, we are.
Do you know where we are?
We're in Siberia.
Not funny.
There might be something out here.
Oh, God!
I'm going to get water.
Where are you going?
Home-- where the hell is it?
Why is she being such a bitch?
Why are you here, by the way, alone?
(Annie) Shut up, Miljan.
(Neeko) Guys, have you seen Carolina?
(Sam) No.
She hasn't come back.
You mean she's not back yet?
She's not back.
I have no idea where she is.
You do know she's out there with Johnny?
Yeah, tell me about it.
Well, I don't know about you, but I feel like I should go and look for her.
I don't-- I don't feel comfortable with her with Johnny.
(Sam) Before it gets too late, I think we should.
I'm game, yeah.
(Neeko) - You're gonna come with me?
(Miljan) Gentlemen.
Where the hell were you?
I was in the woods.
Have you seen Carolina?
(Neeko) She's out there with Johnny.
(Miljan) Oh, she'll be fine, guys.
(Miljan) Yes.
They're probably having sex or something.
Oh, you're a funny guy.
Don't be naive. You didn't notice the chemistry they had?
(Neeko) Hey, guys, listen.
I don't know about you.
Just sitting here talking.
(Miljan) Hey, it's dark outside.
(Rumbling)
Oh, fuck!
(Neeko) Get on the bed.
Get onto the bed!
(Miljan) Oh, my God.
The cab started shaking...
It's like-- it's like the sky's on fire.
It's like the sky's on fire.
(Daniel) The sky went from dark to light, and it looked like it was on fire, just like Victoria said.
If this is all part of the game, it's beyond me at this point.
I don't understand how they could pull it off.
(Sam) I feel like I'm on another planet.
I feel like I walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare, and nobody-- nobody has any answers.
I don't have an answer.
I could sit here all day long and just-- it's way above my pay scale.
- Is it moving?
- It just keeps moving.
Carolina never came back today, did she?
(Woman) Yeah.
Where-- where are they?
(Miljan) She's still in the woods-- the forest.
Well, this can't stop us.
We still have to find her.
We can't leave her out there.
We better go now.
We're just gonna go look for her-- me and Sam, Daniel, Miljan as well.
(Indistinct shouting)
(Woman) What happened?
- What happened?
Then we see Carolina stumbling towards the girls' cabin, and the girls go rushing over to her.
Are you hurt somewhere?
- (Sam) What happened?
- (Woman) Look at all the blood.
What happened?
Guys, don't, don't-- don't go to her.
Oh, my God, look at her arm.
(Sam) What happened to you?
(Neeko) Carolina, what happened?
(Daniel) Carolina shows up, and she's battered and disoriented.
She couldn't even speak.
She's trembling.
(Carolina) I don't...
- (Woman) You don't remember? - (Carolina cries)
(Sam) What do you remember?
(Natalie) She didn't know what was going on.
She was saying she couldn't even, like, remember what she'd been doing out there.
She was just talking nonsense, and it was really jolting to see her come back like that.
(Woman) You were with John?
- (Sam) And what happened?
- (Woman) Where is he?
What were you doing with Johnny?
Get her some water.
Get her some help.
(Neeko) Carolina, were you with Johnny?
(Sam) She said she was.
What were you doing with Johnny?
(Neeko) She said the name "Johnny."
At that point, I just, you know, lost it.
(Neeko) For what?
Here, just come here.
I want to say something to you.
You got to make sure.
You look at his hands.
(Neeko) Okay.
His hands are a tell-tale sign, okay?
His hands will tell you if he did something.
(Daniel) What are you doing?
Stay here with the girls.
Stay here with the girls!
(Neeko) I'm not wasting any more time with this guy.
Everyone wants to keep him around, thinking,
"Oh, yeah, he'll turn around and be a good guy."
I'm not gonna lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back.
- She's been through a lot.
We're gonna look after you, okay?
(Esther) We don't know where Johnny is.
Carolina sort of-- she couldn't say much, but she said that she was-- they were fighting-- her and Johnny were fighting.
And then, now she looks like this, so Johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because Sam and Neeko went after him.
Let's just keep moving.
(Rustling)
(Rustling continues)
The whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that, you know--
We stop and we look, and there's nothing there.
It's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you're being watched, you know.
Whether, you know, whether you're in the woods or in the cabin, you always feel like something is watching you, and the past two nights,
I haven't slept very well, you know.
So I'm just-- you know, you're always looking over your shoulder.
You always think something's there, and, like, the whole thing with the sky now...
(Animal screeches)
Well, he's obviously around here somewhere.
(Rustling)
You keep saying "he," "he."
Look how thick the brush is here.
If there's somebody around here, we'd see them.
We hear other things.
All of a sudden, something goes flying.
I think we should be talking more in the sense of "what."
I'll go see if the water's boiled.
(Natalie) I don't want to die.
I didn't ever expect that that would be a possibility on this show, and every day that I'm here,
I feel like I'm an idiot for staying, that I am gonna end up like Tommy.
I don't deal well with-- Abuse is not something that...
I can handle right now.
(Daniel) And Johnny was already on the outs with the group for stealing food.
I just-- How could he do that to her?
It didn't make sense.
She's such a nice lady.
- What did you do to Carolina?
What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about?
- I didn't--
She's all cut up and shit.
- I kind of came to.
I was walking around, and...
I was- - I saw her.
You saw her where?
You got to tell me what happened.
We were in the woods, and...
I don't really-- I don't really remember.
I get approached by Daniel, and basically started accusing me of hurting Carolina.
(Natalie) What did you to do her? !
The last thing she remembers is getting in a fight with you, so you can't come back here and tell me that you didn't touch her!
I don't.
(Natalie) Then what happened to her?
That's not a very good answer right now, man.
I don't-- trust me.
That's not a very good answer.
(Indistinct shouting in distance)
You're such a scumbag.
Oh, what?
So she just fell down and ended up that way?
I was in a complete haze.
I had no recollection.
I was like blacked out, like I drank too much.
(Daniel) He doesn't look like he knows what's going on.
(Johnny) I don't.
- Then what happened to her?
- (Johnny) I don't know.
(Woman) You were together, weren't you?
- You said that.
Neeko!
(Daniel) Guys, he doesn't know!
(Neeko)
(Daniel)
- (Carolina) Stop!
- (Neeko) Come on!
Neeko, stop it!
Carolina starts screaming, "It's not him.
He didn't do it."
You said you don't remember.
(Neeko) You're a dead man.
(Daniel) Listen.
- (Johnny) I don't know.
Johnny doesn't know anything?
It was just her and him in the forest.
I saw it in his eyes, okay?
All I remember is I talked to her.
We were arguing.
And then I-I came here, and I started getting accused, and I don't even know what the fuck is going on.
(Sam) If we caught him in the woods, he would've been dead.
When I saw that look in his eyes,
I just felt that I needed to take a step back.
Remember the way she came into camp?
He's got the same look on his face.
(Johnny) Does she remember anything?
(Woman) Show us your hands.
(Woman) (Gasps)
(Natalie) Oh, yeah.
I've seen that before.
(Woman) What's that from?
(Sam) Nothing's making sense here.
And just to be angry and become a bunch of animals--
We can't go killing each other.
We're still human beings.
(Hiss)
(Talking indistinctly)
(Birds chirping)
I don't like things that I can't explain and that I don't have at least some sort of control over.
The sky changing color and looking like fire-- the producers, the show can't do that.
We're talking supernatural stuff now.
Regardless of everything else, that's real, and that scared the hell out of me.
(Johnny) It seems like everybody at camp was convinced that I was the person that hurt her.
I've never hit a woman in my life.
I don't know why I would.
I don't remember anything, but...
I can't say that I didn't 'cause I don't--
But I know in my heart I wouldn't do that.
(Carolina) I don't remember anything.
All I remember is that I was... with--
Went to get Johnny.
He was in the woods.
I found him, and I...
It's all one big blur, like one big blackout.
I have all these marks on my body, and my shirt is broken, and I don't remember.
So you're telling me this is real.
(Sabina) Yes.
It looks like it's native, handmade.
It looks like it's just a prop to me.
Well, if it's a prop, it's really well-made 'cause you see the barbs.
They're curved.
That's exactly how it should look.
This is ox.
It's real ox.
And it's balanced for throwing.
It just looks perfect.
It's your choice to believe in it or not, but this is real, so...
I don't have to deal with lies in figuring out what is true, what is not.
I have to know the environment I'm in.
I have to know what's out there in order to protect myself and survive.
So, I found this symbol that is really strange.
It has four lines and little triangles on the ends.
Then I found another one and another one, and I realized it's a path.
I should follow them.
At the end, it was very close to the settlement.
I found the last one.
And I found this box.
It was a metal box.
I opened it, and it was a book.
I didn't understand anything because it was in a different language.
I would assume it's Russian because it's cyrillic letters.
(Miljan) In the middle of me looking at it, somebody was watching at me.
And he just disappeared in a second.
So there are people out there.
I didn't want to screw anything up or make anything awkward for her.
I guess I was in a weird mood, and I just want to apologize because I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything, because I'm really glad you're--
(Natalie) When I realized what Annie's real feelings were for me,
"I'm sort of open to love in any form right now."
So I kissed her.
(Chuckles)
Which I kind of surprised myself at, to be honest.
Can I have a seat?
(Carolina) Do you remember anything from last night?
I don't remember anything either.
But I know you didn't hurt me.
I would never hurt you.
(Man) ♪ people in life, they will come and go ♪
♪ like the boats sailing by my door ♪
♪ you can be the ocean, you can be the shore ♪
♪ this mystery wind, she will always blow ♪
♪ don't worry, don't worry, dear, no more ♪
♪ and now your message in a bottle ♪
♪ is being tumbled in the beach flies ♪
♪ you can be the lilies in the fields ♪
♪ I'll be the fool ♪
♪ but don't worry, don't worry, dear, no more ♪
♪ trouble in life, it will come and go ♪
(Johnny) Can I ask you something, though?
Why'd you set me up?
With the shed and the food?
She couldn't even look me in the eye.
And I was like, "Well..."
I was like, "It tells me all I need to know,"
so I was like-- got the hell out of there.
(Spanish) Stop, please.
Johnny, wait for me.
- Give me a break. (Spanish) Oh, my God. - (Daniel) Hey.
You're an actress.
She said, like, this slogan.
Like, "I know that.
I know that from somewhere."
And then it just-- the light bulb went off.
Yeah, that's like your slogan.
She's that actress from that show that--
I'm like, "That's how I know you."
I didn't want-
- I asked them.
You didn't want to do what?
I didn't want to burn it down.
So you're-- you're helping the show?
- Mom, may I please go to the toilet?
It's me.
Olivier! What are you doing here?
You thought you were going to America without me?
You're coming with us?
Wow! I'm so happy!
- But how can we do it?
- Don't worry, I planned everything.
I have my health card.
I even pinched some money from Jean and Elodie... for the train.
See, I still have some left.
You can't pay the boat fare with that.
I'll try to get hired as a cabin boy, or a dishwasher.
Or hide with you as a stowaway.
I'll feed you.
In America, Samuel will help me cross the border.
Now that you're an orphan, my parents could adopt you.
That would be swell.
We'd be brothers!
Let's go see my parents.
Wouldn't it be better to meet on the boat?
But no. They'll be really happy to see you.
They were awfully worried.
Is Elodie with you?
No. She doesn't know I'm coming with you.
Coming with us?
Now what is this all about?
We could take him to America.
But these children are utterly out of their minds!
Olivier, we would gladly take you if we could, but we're not your parents.
We can adopt him!
David, look.
We can't just adopt someone.
And then, Olivier has a family, an aunt who has the means to give him a good education.
I don't want to go to Aunt Victoria's.
She's a cow! Listen.
Once we get to Havre, I'll call Elodie.
I'll buy a ticket for your return, and she'll come... pick you up at the Saint-Lazare station.
I pinched money from her to take the train.
I will explain... and she'll understand.
If he can't come with us, then I'm staying with him.
Isaac, tell them it's not possible!
Listen, Olivier...
We understand your sorrow but please, be reasonable.
No. It's not true.
You understand nothing!
You only think of yourself!
No, Olivier.
Olivier, wait for me!
David, come back!
Hurry David, hurry up!
Children, come back!
Ouch!
My leg!
- I got one. - Olivier!
It wasn't my son who pulled the alarm.
It was a friend who wanted to come with us.
He's all alone. You must find him!
- Come here, David.
I don't want to go with you.
Come back, kid.
What happened?
A kid pulled the alarm.
You should put a flare on the track for the next train.
David!
David.
- Where are you're going, boy?
That's pretty far off!
I had planned to take the train.
I'm going to Paris as well. I'll take you.
Besides, I don't like traveling alone, so we'll be doing each other a favor.
Anyone in the back?
No. I'm going back empty.
- So, okay.
- Where in Paris do you live?
I'm not from Paris, I'm from the Hill.
A real urchin, hey.
Your parents just let you go?
My parents are really cool.
- So....so...
The police have issued an APB.
Zober was the last to see him.
Since then, not a trace.
And that's not all!
They want to fine him for pulling the alarm.
And for the money he's stolen?
- Did you tell them?
I'm waiting for them to find him.
I hope he didn't do anything stupid.
Him? What do you think!
Just wait. He'll get what's coming to him.
I want him out of here.
He's a sack of shit!
- Listen.
- I don't want to hear it!
I'll kick his ass straight to the reformatory!
What do you want, lad?
I'd like to talk to Mr. Privat.
He should be here.
No. He's at home now, in Auvergne.
Can I call him?
My mother often called him from here.
So you are the son of Mrs. Châteauneuf?
Everyone is looking for you, even the police.
Could you ring Number 3 at Saugues, please.
It's in Haute-Loire.
You won't tell the cops, eh?
Mr. Privat?
Excuse me. This is Hotel Du Cantal.
I have Mrs. Châteauneuf's son here.
Yes, this is Olivier.
You must help me. I did something stupid.
I ran away and stole money from Elodie.
I'm really scared.
Hello, Mr. Privat?
You'll sleep here.
Hello!
This breakfast should give you a boost.
But first... I must tell you what happened.
Everything's been sorted out.
I've already been to the police station and have spoken to Elodie.
- She's glad you're in good health.
- She won't send me to reform school?
Nothing of the sort.
Everyone knows what you're going through right now.
Elodie even has a surprise for you.
Come on, eat up.
Then we'll go see her.
This is so good!
Olivier, I'm so glad to see you.
You're okay?
- You're not too tired?
Elodie... I wanted to apologize.
For the money and for the scare I've given you.
You know, we all make mistakes.
It wasn't too serious.
And we understand you.
Without your mom, and also with David's departure...
This is why mister Privat and we decided to make you a big surprise.
You'll go with him to Saugues.
You'll see, there you'll be very, very happy.
You'll have a big bedroom all to yourself.
You'll learn to ride a horse.
And then the mountain air, there's nothing better for a child!
And I don't live far from your grandparents.
You can see them when you want.
And there's also a very good school.
Your studies will be better there.
What does Aunt Victoria say?
She wouldn't let me see you!
Who does she think she is?
It's none of her business.
Well, don't stand there.
Sit down, Mr. Privat.
After all, it was your mother's idea, to go with Mr. Privat.
If you want to, of course.
When's that gonna be?
Well, today.
You see, I finished packing your suitcase.
So you can catch the 2 PM train.
You'll see, you'll be better off there than here.
- Why so fast?
- Aunt Victoria could make trouble.
Trouble?
Yes. By law I don't have the right to take you.
I'll have a lawyer if necessary.
I'll say that it was your mother's wish and yours as well.
Don't you worry Olivier.
You'd only get miserable here.
There are too many memories.
I wonder if I have time to say goodbye to Mado.
You and your Mado, I tell you!
Better hurry, you don't want to miss the 2 PM train.
Get on with it.
I'm so happy to see you.
You gave us such a scare!
- Well, come in!
I came to say goodbye.
I'm going to Auvergne with a friend of my mother's.
It may be the best for you.
- Hurry up!
- Yes.
I'll have to go.
By the way...
I just wanted to tell you that...
I'll never forget you.
Goodbye, Olivier.
- Don't forget to write me!
- Yes, Mado.
Hey, artilleryman!
Hitting the road without saying goodbye?
Yeah. I'm going to Auvergne.
Give my regards to the volcanoes!
- Right, shall we go?
Where you're going with that suitcase?
Maybe for good.
Don't forget me too fast, okay?
Come on, Oliver.
I made you some pancakes.
I know you like them so much.
You can eat them on the train.
You were always so sweet.
Don't change too much over there.
Okay, I'll leave you here because... farewells makes me too sad.
Olivier, it's for your own good, you know that don't you?
Come on, give me a kiss.
Now don't you worry.
- Thank you, Mr. Privat.
- Goodbye. Let's go.
I say, you're a real celebrity around here.
Have you ever been to Saugues, before the funeral?
No, sir. Never.
Call me André.
Gare d'Orsay.
Get in.
I can't leave my street.
It's not because of you, but I want to stay here.
- Why did you call me, then?
I thought... - I know.
But I don't want to leave my street.
I don't want to leave Bougras, Mado,
Capdeverre, Loulou...
I don't even want to leave I'Araignée.
Don't worry, Olivier.
I understand completely.
We will do what you want.
Anyway, think about it.
If you need me, write me.
Where is Mr. Privat?
Well, he took a taxi.
I didn't want to leave.
What? Are you crazy?
Everything was arranged!
I don't want to leave my street.
I don't want to leave my friends.
And you, of course.
You think you're gonna stay with us?
We can't afford it, you know that!
If that's the way it's going to be, I'll inform Aunt Victoria.
And the family council will have to decide.
Henri, I'm counting on you.
You will be firm.
As usual, my dear.
Wow, check out this tin can!
Can you believe this?
It's slick.
- Really snazzy!
- Hey, get away from there!
Here we are!
- Hello, Henri.
- Hello, Jean.
Ah, here's our little adventurer.
- Hello, Elodie.
You'll be able to brag about the awful fright you gave us.
Oh yes!
You can say that again!
As you know, the haberdashery has been sold.
I gathered for you some of your mother's things, Olivier.
There are some personal items, souvenirs, photos of your father, - and several school notebooks.
- Thanks, aunt.
It's only natural, Olivier.
Your uncle is now your guardian and will look after the money you will receive.
Say uncle, what is a guardian?
It means I am responsible for you.
- As if you were my father?
- Yes, something like that.
Come one, sort these out in your room.
What's a family council?
Well, the family gathers to determine what is best for your future.
Why can't I listen to what's being said?
Because that's the way it is.
Go, please leave us.
Take it.
Go.
Please, let's sit down and talk.
What do you plan on doing with him?
Us, what do you mean?
It's up to you to take him. You're his aunt.
I'm only his cousin, and a distant one at that.
Come on. I'm sure we can find a solution together.
One obviously comes to mind.
Yes. The orphanage.
That might be a little harsh.
We had something else in mind.
If we wanted to honor Virginie's wishes, it would be up to M. Privat to take care of him.
I've said it before and I'll say it again:
- It is out of the question.
He's an ex-convict, remember that.
What would the people say in Saugues?
What would they think of us?
Besides, the kid doesn't want that.
How would you know?
I suppose I can tell you, now.
On the day he returned from his fugue, he called Privat at his estate.
I thought it was because he wanted to go stay with him.
Unfortunately, at the last minute, he decided he wanted to stay with us.
If I understand correctly, you decided this without our knowing.
It would have suited everyone.
I'm not of that opinion.
But, since you deemed it unnecessary to consult me, it's because you don't recognize my right.
It's up to you to take care of him.
Besides, his world is here.
In our milieu, he would be all confused.
That's it, Victoria.
You're too good for your brother's son.
No need to be so offensive.
Unquestionably, you can't deny... that Olivier has spent all of his life on this street.
His school and his friends are here.
Besides, at this moment, with my son coming down with tuberculosis, have you thought of the risk of contagion?
Yes, of course I have.
How are we going to feed him?
- We're already struggling.
- And this apartment is too small.
Temporarily, of course.
Well in that case, maybe we could keep him.
We would need...
I don't know... 150 francs a month.
- What? Half of that would be plenty.
That just wouldn't be enough.
But we will make an effort until the end of the school year.
After that, we won't be able to.
You do know that we hope to have a child of our own soon.
Elodie, you've been chanting that for the last 2 years.
How can you say that, Victoria!
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- That's too easy! Jean, tell her to get out of here!
Now, now, precious, Victoria has apologized.
Implying that we're only good at making babes with tuberculosis, that takes the cake!
I will not stay here one second longer.
- Let's go, Henri.
- No. Wait for me in the car.
Especially since we agreed to a settlement.
Henri, I would think that with 115... okay, let's say 110, we could make ends meet. Come now, let's not negotiate again.
Our proposition stands at 100.
If that doesn't work out, we can always discuss it further.
- So let's start with 100.
- Here is the first month's.
- Goodbye, Henri.
- Yes, goodbye.
Elodie, open the door, please.
Ah, you!
You could have taken my side at least!
They were ready to give us 100 francs. I wasn't going to mess with that.
Lucky for us, I patched things up!
You call that patching things up?
You know it won't be enough.
I told you, we need at least 130 Franc.
If I work for the rest, maybe I can stay?
You know the answer is yes.
You're eavesdropping.
But not for long. But why?
Because you're a pain, that's why.
All you care about is whether you can stay or not!
Look at you.
You're yelling at the kid, yet in front of Victoria, you can't grow a pair!
You... looks like you're courting back luck.
I got it, I got it!
"Dear David,
"It's been 6 weeks to this day since your departure.
"I have no news from you, which means you're probably busy,
"as well as your parents."
Hey, Olivier, you coming?
We've made our own wading pool.
Now, let me give you some advice.
Come play with us instead of wasting ink...
- on a guy who'll never answer you.
- Would you leave me alone, Loulou?
Come on, Loulou!
I'm coming!
Glazier!
So, artilleryman, you still here?
Why the sad face?
David is gone.
I have no news of him.
I can't stay with my cousins.
I would have to somewhat earn my keep.
You could always help me with my chores, right?
You'll see, earning your keep isn't that hard.
And if you ask me, you shouldn't waste your time like this, staring for hours at your mother's old boutique.
That won't bring her back, you know.
I know it's not fair.
And with your best friend gone.
You feel abandoned.
But friends... you still have quite a few around here.
And you'll make new ones.
See, look at your buddies.
You have to open up, Olivier.
You understand?
Come on, Olive!
No bad feelings!
Go on, go!
Come on, we're having a splash!
Hurry up, for God's sake!
Aren't you done yet wasting this water... with your stupid games?
- Bunch of gutter-puppies!
- We're doing nothing wrong.
"Nothing wrong"?
What if there's a fire, where would the water come from?
Come on, Mr. Gastounet, have you never been young? Children should have fun.
What right have you, madame?
I have no lessons to learn from a....from a hooker.
Are you afraid you might get hooked, Mr. Gastounet?
I think I could teach you a few things.
Let's stop there.
I have nothing to say to you.
You started it, old fart.
She really nailed you, Gastounet!
You anarchist, I have nothing to say to you.
And you? Who do you think you are, you old Grinch.
We're not about to stop the children from having fun!
Taking the moral high ground instead of sweeping his own porch.
What a sourpuss!
- How's the work coming downstairs?
- Very well, very well.
- Bougras says we'll be done by 5.
- Good.
That's very good.
Here you go, two cheese sandwiches.
Enjoy. Thank you very much.
Ah... there's I'Araignée.
Good day, sir, you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
The Salvation Army and Soup Kitchen close in the spring.
I'm hungry. Artilleryman!
Where are my sandwiches?
Coming, coming!
Good Lord, a nice shot of red and a cheese sandwich.
the only 2 things worth living for!
Hey, hey...easy there little feller.
I offer for the taste, not to guzzle.
If you're thirsty, drink water.
Would you like a fag, Monsieur Bougras?
Ernest gave them to me.
Oh no. Bougras, he always sticks to the pipe.
Say, monsieur Bougras...
Why do you have a beard?
It's to hide the ugly mug underneath!
Now then, back to work!
Look here, I think you're filling them up too much.
You trying to get me sloshed?
- See you, Ernest.
- See you!
Well, my cellar rats?
Mission accomplished, boss!
But there are 3 bottles that are a bit cloudy.
That's normal, it's the bottom of the barrel.
You can have them.
Not a bad lot, but I can't sell them.
- Good. Now, we agreed on 25 Franc?
- Yes, that's it.
- Here, then.
- Thanks.
Here, this is for you.
Ten francs?
But it's too much, Mr.Bougras.
Didn't you say you needed extra dough to help your cousin?
And to top it off, here's an eggplant for suppertime.
- But why?
- It's not for your work,
I owed your mother money, but I forgot.
You can check the ledgers, it's all in writing.
In that case, thanks!
That should help with your keep.
Your cousin will probably want you to stay, now.
- What can I get you?
- Anything you want, except red.
Nothing for me, I have errands.
- So long, Ernest.
So long, Bougras.
- So long, kid! - How about white wine?
- Can't say no to that.
That must be him!
You know how late you are?
Where were you?
- We started without you.
- Forgive me, Elodie.
- Good Lord, you're reeking of wine!
- And what's this?
A leg of veal!
Leg of veal?
- You didn't steal it I hope?
- No. No. I've been working with Bougras at the Transatlantique.
In that case, that's really nice of you.
I even brought you some wine, Jean.
Beaujolpif?
Let's have a swig!
- Would you like a bit?
- Sure I would.
- So, how is it?
- Not bad, not bad.
Excellent, yeah!
See? He's not a bad kid, after all.
We would keep you if we were rich, you know.
No worries. I could stop going to school.
I could scrounge a bit more with Bougras.
I would earn more money and help you out.
Don't be stupid, Olivier!
You think your mom would approve of you turning into a street urchin?
You don't want to go to school, anymore?
End up as a drop-out like Bougras?
If I could have stayed longer in school, we wouldn't be here today.
He's right. You're lucky to have your Aunt Victoria.
- We're too young.
- And you don't want me around.
Don't say that..
But taking care of you is a sacrifice.
If he had to work, people would say we're exploiting him.
His Aunt should take him in.
No! You also said she's a cow.
We'll talk about that later.
For now, you'll still go to school.
Alright, Jean.
May I have some more?
You certainly have an appetite this evening.
I'm flattered.
Here you go!
Thanks, Elodie.
Look at this scoundrel.
No wonder his plate emptied so fast!
Show me your napkin.
It's for a kitten.
A kitten?
You think we're stupid?
No, I swear it!
A kitten eating potatoes?
That'll be the day!
Come on, give it to me.
No, wait!
Don't throw it out!
Why not?
You'll see.
Go ahead, put it in.
That way, we'll have an hour or two to ourselves.
Yes, you're right.
Here you go, Olivier.
Go feed that kitten of yours.
- Thanks, Jean.
- Alright, scram.
We'll leave a key under the mat.
And you turn off the light.
Very well.
See you tomorrow, Elodie!
- No funny stuff, okay?
- Don't worry.
Your vest!
Elodie...
I think we're too soft on him.
The longer he stays the more he gets attached.
You think I'm not getting attached?
Thanks, kid.
Smells good!
It was better when it was hot.
It's veal with potatoes.
Good, huh?
Delicious.
I'll eat it later.
I also have a fag.
I'm in heaven!
That's swell!
I have something for you.
It's an anthology on the language of flowers.
I didn't know flowers could talk.
Not on their own, of course.
If a man offers one to a woman, it speaks without making a sound.
Each flower has its own meaning.
That is the language of flowers.
Hey, Olivier, want to join me?
I'm going to the basilica to see the night over Paris.
I can't go.
Don't you see I'm chatting with my buddy?
Your loss.
Girls....
They're such leeches.
You won't always think that.
A few beans, monsieur!
Châteauneuf, bring to me whatever you are reading.
The Language of Flowers?
We have a poet in our midst.
Let's see if you've at least learned something.
What is, according to this leaflet, the meaning of... the oak-leaf geranium?
It symbolizes true friendship.
That is correct.
The white Japanese camellia?
Perfect beauty.
- And the acacia?
- Elegance, monsieur.
You see, if you want, you'd get better grades!
Yes. Yes.
- Hello, Mado.
- Hello, Olivier.
For me?
Oh, you shouldn't have!
They are magnificent.
They didn't cost me anything.
I went to the opening of Les Halles with Bougras.
We gave a hand to a flower merchant.
Red roses.
You know what it means when a man offers red roses to a woman?
No, not at all.
It's a statement of passionate love.
Oh yeah?
Would you like a cup of tea?
Oh yeah! I love tea, now.
Take it.
Tell me, any news from your friend David?
And I wrote him so many letters.
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get one soon.
I don't care anymore.
I'll make new friends.
That I am sure of.
Now.
I must get dressed.
You stay here and finish your tea.
I just step into the other room.
I'm keeping warm all over, my little heart is as white as a toad's underbelly.
Worries, I have but a few.
Troubles, I couldn't care less.
What's gotten over you?
I got promoted to film editor at Pathé cinema.
Really? That's swell!
You bet your ass!
I'm starting on the newsreels, and after that I can work... my way up to the big movies.
That dress I saw in the Galeries, maybe we can afford it, now?
Elodie, I can see it right now over your shoulders.
And the tandem.
We'll get the bike too. For our Sunday outings!
Oh yeah!
Say!
Maybe you can keep me now?
If I have the means, Olivier.
If I have the means.
You know, Elodie is pregnant.
Can you imagine?
A baby and you in this tiny apartment?
You're expecting a baby?
Well, yes.
That's neat!
When is it due?
Well, in 5 months.
You see, it still gives you some time.
Anyway, I'm really happy for you.
I forgot, Olivier!
You must hurry.
Mr. Privat came to see you.
Mr. Privat?
He's in Paris?
Yes, just a stopover.
He's waiting for you at the Marcadet Palace to see a movie.
So go!
You gotta hurry.
Don't forget your vest!
When our teacher talks about the war, he never mentions any of this.
Is that how it really was?
Far worse.
It was a slaughterhouse.
I shouldn't have brought you to see this.
For a child, it's too sad.
I remember a time.
Papa would always say: "That fucking war".
What was my dad like?
I've told you already.
You father and I were friends long before the war.
He was injured during the assault on the Marne.
He wrote me saying they had captured lots of German soldiers... completely drunk from guzzling too much champagne.
Ours!
Our champagne!
He got hurt two days later, during a counter- strike.
Your dad was right:
"Fucking war!"
My mom would always answer him... that it was thanks to the war they got married.
Father was wounded and mother was the nurse, and that's how it all started.
It's a beautiful story.
Yes, Olivier.
There's Bougras!
He's a sandwich man, now?
Playbill?
One for you.
Get your playbill right here.
He's my buddy.
I'll introduce you.
Hey, hey, my artilleryman, on vacation I see?
Enjoying the flick?
Good day, monsieur Bougras.
I'd like you to meet Mr. Privat. He was my mother's best friend.
We just saw The Wooden Crosses.
It was well done.
In terms of bloodbaths, this one was well done, yes.
You got nothing better to do than take him to a war film?
You shouldn't say that.
Mr. Privat is a hero.
You're nuts if you think that!
As if there were heroes in a war.
In a war there're only victims and assassins.
How many Krauts did he kill?
Ten?
Twenty? Fifty?
That's it?
And today, we proudly sport medals!
What you really want is that he admires you.
Wasn't it enough to lose an arm?
Would it please you, if he also goes to war.
I wish he will never have to.
That's what we fought for.
Yeah, yeah, la-Dee-da, la-Dee-la!
Yeah, I've heard it before.
I know the tune.
You'd better take him to Luna Park instead, to see Charlie Chaplin.
It would be funnier.
Ah, what the fuck.
You make me sick.
- See you later, mates!
- Wait...
Bougras...
As for you, don't bother me.
You're a twit, just like the others.
I don't ever want to see you.
Good morning, monsieur Bougras.
Something wrong, Olivier?
No, I'm fine.
It's just that Mr. Bougras doesn't want to see me anymore.
Ah, I wouldn't worry about it.
He's a bit like me.
Sometimes, we get angry at the whole world.
It comes and goes.
- Want to do something for me?
- Yes, what?
A shelf came down in my room.
No sweat. After school, I'll fix it impeccable.
- See you later.
Just like new.
Thank you, Olivier.
Here, could you place this on the shelf?
Oh, darn!
"The Terrible Fall of Daniel."
"Daniel, King of the trapeze."
"The terrible fall.
Last night in Paris, during his performance...
"at the winter circus, the famous trapeze artist Daniel...
"fell 12 m to the ground."
"Daniel's terrible accident."
"Unbelievable but true:
Daniel still the best."
Do you know this Daniel?
He's a buddy of yours?
It was you?
You were flying the trapeze?
Here, that was you?
If you don't mind, this stays between us.
Out of vanity.
You see, I still rather inspire fear than pity.
Oh my, you sure have a lot of books!
Oh, once I had many more.
I sold nearly all of them.
Everyone has to eat.
What a shame.
I've become attached to this neighbourhood, to this street.
I wouldn't want to leave it and wind up in an old people's home, even if I was better off, given my condition.
I understand you.
I don't want to leave either.
And why would you?
Jean and Elodie will soon have a baby.
When the baby is born, they won't be able to keep me.
There might a way.
Look, behind the cupboard. That's your cousin's place.
So that means I sleep right over there.
I say, that is funny!
Here, I'd like to give you a book.
Not just any book, mind you.
It's a bit thick, but once you've read it, life and books will no longer hold secrets for you.
Pretty heavy, hey?
It's the weight of knowledge.
"Amouillante,
"noun, feminine and adjective:
"cow ready to calve.
"Amor,
"Latin word meaning love:
"physical or emotional attraction of one person toward another,"
"Physical or emotional attraction of one person toward another."
Capdeverre.
Five. And I went easy on you.
You obviously want to be a boxer, but it looks like... you forgot to take your gloves off before starting your essay.
Loulou.
Not a bad piece, even funny at times.
However, gangster is not a profession.
If your ideals only tend toward dough, shooters and broads, you'll hit the slammer faster than a jackrabbit.
Châteauneuf.
Why did your write your essay in verse?
I don't know, it's more beautiful!
"He who pushes his talents accomplishes nothing with grace", my child.
Anyway, I do see the effort.
And in terms of vocabulary, you went the extra mile.
However... I do ask myself, why do all of your aspirations start with the letter A?
You contemplate becoming an: acrobat, architect, administrator, athlete, armorer, aviator, ambassador, astrologer, anthropologist... and artistic lyricist.
Careful not to spread yourself too thin.
I gave you an 8.
It's a little harsh, but see it as an encouragement.
Ernest.
I would have liked to see you become as imaginative.
You'd like to be a coffee-shop owner, like papa.
Excuse me, Mr. Gastounet.
Children, our country is facing hard times.
President Doumer was shot down at noon today by a madman.
His situation is hopeless.
Consequently, you will all go home to your parents.
And tomorrow you will stay home as a sign of national mourning.
- Yeah!
All this will finish badly, very badly...
And so, in this edition, we'll follow the funeral of President Paul Doumer... and the results of the legislative elections, and also the leftist swing in Parliament.
So... for Doumer's funeral, we went all out.
We have 7 cameras.
One at the entrance and exit of the Elysée, and all along the procession route in Paris.
This way, we'll have a good assessment of the crowd: tens of thousands of mourners.
The assassin:
Goryoulov.
It's the only record we have.
We have no footage.
And we'll end with the elections.
It's familiar ground, but at least we'll give out some results.
The Left wins 91 seats.
Lights!
It's good, but I want everything... you've got on the assassination and funeral of Doumer.
Nobody cares about the elections.
Especially since your footage is as dull as dishwater.
Yes, you're right.
Sir, although the footage of Doumer's funeral is powerful, the real important event are the elections.
For the first time in many years, the left regained a majority!
Young man, the people want to see something spectacular.
Agreed. But we can't downplay the upsurge by the left.
First of all, the left is not yet the ruling party.
Second, learn to mind your own business.
Oh, but it is my business!
I'm a citizen just like you.
Alright. We'll see about that later.
You should have seen the way I nailed the producer today!
He didn't even want to talk about the elections!
Aren't you're not pushing your luck?
You just started there. I know you with your big mouth!
Oh, don't get me started!
What do you call this?
- It's a surprise.
- Really?
Who made this hole in the wall?
The landlord made it.
Oh yeah?
What for? Well, when the neighbour moved out, I told the landlord we needed more space for the baby.
- He had to study the wall's integrity.
- Did he say yes?
Yes. He'll come to talk about raising the rent.
That would be fantastic!
We wouldn't have to move to a larger flat.
L'Araignée used to live here.
Yes. This morning, he was taken to the old people's home.
He asked to be taken.
He found it harder to get up the stairs.
We won't see him anymore?
Well, one man's loss is another man's gain.
Listen, before checking out, he left some books for you.
- May I say something?
- Go ahead.
With this room, if I sleep here... I'll be less of a burden.
We want this to be the baby's room.
I know, but in the meantime.
You, when your mind is set on something...
Alright, then.
Until the baby is born, you can squat.
- Yeah!
- And tomorrow, I'll take you to the studio. You'll work all day as an extra on a movie set.
Look at that.
- What a beauty!
- It's a Delage.
Last word of advice: when you're on the set, and the red light is on, you gotta shut up.
- Especially when you hear the clapper.
- Understood. And never look in the camera.
Let's go say hello.
- Good morning, Fernand.
- Jean, I need to talk to you. The kid's an extra for the day. I'm taking him now on the set.
Jean, it's not about the kid.
It's about you. You can't go in anymore.
You're joking, right!
No, I'm not joking. They're letting you go.
Here's you're last pay.
I'm fired? Just like that?
I want to see a manager!
The boss is not here this morning.
Come back this afternoon.
But I doubt they'll change their minds.
Well I won't take this lying down.
They don't know who they're dealing with.
I'm not going!
No. You must go.
We'll take the other street and blend in with the extras.
- Jean! - Don't give me a rough time.
- But, Jean!
Why must you always talk about politics?
How will we manage now with the landlord?
We'll have to pay for the hole.
I'm sure we'll find a solution.
Did you see about getting your job back as a boom operator?
Yep. They already filled the position.
But that can't be!
Why must this be happening to us right now?
My wages for being an extra.
You can have it.
I hope it helps to pay for the baby's room.
Now there's a repeat performance!
We're in the shit hole and all you can think of is yourself.
You don't care about us.
You just want to make sure you can live here! No, Jean.
That's not true, I swear it.
I swear it!
You're selfish!
Hypocrite!
I don't want your fucking dough!
Listen! I'm out of action.
There's no way we can support you.
Get the hell out!
But, Jean!
Why did you tell him that?
Hey, kitty.
Minou.
Come back!
Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Did you start this fire?
You're in big trouble you little brat!
- But I didn't do anything, sir.
- And this, what do you call this?
Why did you start this fire, miserable arsonist.
- You're parents will have to pay.
- They're both dead.
You don't get off that easy.
Anymore tricks up your sleeve?
I know this kid. He's the haberdasher's orphan.
- He even stole from his cousins.
- He's a hooligan.
- He belongs in a reform school!
- But I did nothing wrong!
C'mon folks, what's this: the Apocalypse!
C'mon, leave him alone.
This rapacious mutt just set fire to a dwelling of honest folks!
"Honest folks!" Ha, ha!
Show me half a dozen! Even one or two if you can!
Have you never been a kid and done stupid things?
C'mon! Clear away!
C'mon, hop on, kid!
C'mon, c'mon!
Cheers, mates!
Rise up, rise up!
The hour is near to start the revolt!
The hour is near to start the revolt.
Yipper!
Now my Olive.
Hang in there. It's all over.
Will I have to go to reform school?
Of course not. No reform school.
You're with Jean and Elodie, you're not alone.
As a matter of fact, Jean lost his job.
- They can't keep me anymore.
- Shit. Talk about bad luck.
I sure hope I'Araignée didn't leave for nothing.
He made me swear I wouldn't tell anyone, especially you.
He left his room for your benefit.
You understand what I'm saying?
He wanted you to stay.
So he arranged a meeting... between Elodie and the landlord.
But I didn't want him to leave!
- Tell me it's not true.
- I'm afraid it is.
That's why you can't go.
C'mon, artilleryman, we can't lose hope, right?
You'll see, things will work out for Jean.
And that little mishap with the fire, it's nothing serious.
Not at all...
Besides, nothing should be taken seriously.
- So you're not angry with me anymore?
- Angry?
- Oh, it's you.
- Yep, it's me. I forgot my keys.
Elodie!
Elodie. Are you there?
She'll be back later tonight.
- What are you talking about?
Ernest asked her to stay longer to help him at the Transatlantique.
- But the Transat is closed in the evening.
- No, no. It's the annual dinner of the Montmartre Fellowship Alumni.
It will end late.
And you, what's new?
Nothing.
I've been looking for work for over a month.
"Sorry, sir, there is nothing."
"There's nothing" "There's nothing"!
Fucking crisis!
One of these days, the keg will blow!
The misers will still get away with it, but not for long!
They'll get what's coming to them!
We'll make mincemeat out of them!
You hear me, Olivier?
Look at what I prepared.
Stuffed tomatoes!
- You made this?
Mother taught me how.
- I'll get it, I'll get it.
- No, stay here, I'll get it.
- Oh. It's the charming Mado!
- Good evening, Jean.
Well, do come in, come in.
Sorry to disturb you...
I was supposed to go out with a girlfriend, but her mom fell sick.
- So I thought maybe you would like to...
I was thinking more about Olivier...
There is no school tomorrow, I promised to take him to the restaurant.
If that would make him happy.
Right Olivier?
Would you like to go out with Mado?
Oh yes, Jean.
I won't bring him back late.
I hope not!
We'll leave a key under the mat.
Here. I brought you a tie so you'll look elegant.
I'll put it on right now. And some Gomina gel.
Alright, get a move on!
So...everything arranged for tomorrow?
You're certain?
At what time they'll pick him up?
At 2 pm. His uncle Henri will pick him up.
Poor kid...
He's doesn't know yet?
It will be a terrible blow.
Yes, I know.
Anyway, thanks for taking him out tonight.
I really like him, you know.
I'm ready!
Oh, my. Really classy, Olivier!
Monsieur will taste the wine.
Ah, it is good, huh!
A little warm.
It is not warm, young man, it is ambient.
My friend Bougras says the Saint-Emilion is better when brought up from the cellar.
Would you have a bottle from the cellar?
We do. But if I may, I would not recommend it.
But monsieur Maurice!
If it's Madame's wish, we get a bottle from the cellar.
And may Madame and Monsieur enjoy an excellent meal.
Lesson number 5: the client is king.
Forgive me, madame, or mademoiselle... your face looks familiar.
I'm sure we've met before, but I don't seem to remember.
- Perhaps you can help me?
- Sir!
Can't you see I'm with my fiance?
And, bingo!
Lesson number 6:
Never bother a lady if she hasn't been introduced to you.
To draw her attention, have a garcon deliver a card.
Or flowers.
- To our health!
- Ah no. You must simply raise your glass and smile as you look at me.
Very well, Mado.
You could then propose a toast, but not usually with the ladies.
Was everything satisfactory?
It was.... exquisite!
- I would like some sweet strawberries.
- And for the young man?
How about a nice Paris-Brest?
- Isn't that a bicycle race?
- No, it's also a cake.
- Sir, do you have plum pudding?
- Most certainly.
- Let's go for the plum pudding!
- Very well, monsieur.
Apparently, it's as good as love.
I'd like to thank you again, Mado.
It was really... really... romantic!
- Ah, I'll give you back the tie.
- No.
Keep it. You'll have a souvenir of me.
A souvenir?
But we'll see each other soon.
That's what I meant.
You can keep it forever.
So long, gentleman.
Hello, Ernest.
What did he say? - Nothing.
I didn't tell him.
You were supposed to tell him last night.
Henri will arrive in half an hour.
But surely, we must tell him now.
I was wondering if we couldn't keep him.
Listen, Jean, we're not starting that again.
It's not possible.
God knows when you'll find a job.
And in 3 months I won't be able to work because of the baby. I'm sad too.
But that's how it is. Nothing we can do. Elodie.
The order for No.4! Be right there!
It's coming.
Where is he now?
He borrowed your fire cups to treat Bougras.
Well, you're going to tell him right now.
Almost done?
- Only two more to go.
- Ah well, go for it.
Firing up!
Oh, my!
If you can heal me with those, I'll buy you a drink.
Mother would often treat me.
She said it's better than medication.
Okay, do the last one.
Ooh, that one's really hot.
Now all we have to do is wait.
Come in!
Greetings, Bougras!
Greetings, Jean.
So, you're playing doctor, now?
He's good at it too. My lord!
It's gonna be a hot day.
Does that surprise you?
It is after all, the beginning of July.
You know, Olivier, in life, there are events more serious than others.
But they shouldn't lead us to over-dramatize.
Everything works out.
All one needs is to show a little willpower.
Isn't that so?
Olivier, I want you to listen to me.
I have news to tell you.
Don't worry, it's actually good news.
As you know, Henri has become your legal guardian.
That means... you'll be like his son.
Can you imagine just how lucky you are?
Don't look so gloomy.
You know we did everything we could to keep you.
But in the long run, it's for your own good.
From now on, you'll live in a large apartment, with wall-to-wall carpets.
Two housemaids.
Two!
You'll be able to go to college and get a real education.
Not to mention, lucky dog, a summer vacation in Touraine.
A few dozen hectares, apparently.
You'll be living like a king!
We didn't want to tell you sooner so as not to... as not to...
Well, that's it.
Your uncle's car should arrive soon.
You mean now?
Right now? Well, yes.
Right now.
But couldn't I go stay with Privat instead?
That, my boy, is your fault.
You had your chance.
I go down to wait for the car.
I gotta pack a suitcase.
You won't have to.
It's already packed.
It's at the Transat.
So long, Bougras.
Take those yogurt jars off of me.
C'mon, do it quick.
You'll see, Mr. Bougras.
Usually, if all goes well, in one hour, you should be feeling better.
I'm sure I'm will.
Thank you, my lad.
You've been a good nurse.
You took good care of me.
Never mind that, I'll put those away.
Is Olivier ready?
Now, now, artilleryman.
You're not gonna start whining?
You're not a girl are you?
No, Mr. Bougras.
C'mon, then...
Let's shake on it, for old time's sake?
It's for me?
I can't take it.
It's too nice.
There you go.
C'mon, get out of here my Olive.
Get out of here. Scat!
Go!
Come on, Olivier, you're not saying goodbye?
Don't worry, you'll be like our son, now.
So long, Olive.
You're in luck.
Take a load of this car!
Goodbye, Châteauneuf!
- See you soon, Olivier!
- Goodbye, Olive!
You like mint lollipops, I think.
Where are we going, uncle?
Your place?
You know, we had a look at your school grades, you'll need classes this summer to catch up.
The director was categorical.
The director?
The director of the college where you will now further your studies.
It's a good establishment. You'll see.
And one of the best in churning out successful students.
Marceau, our son, attended this college.
Even got an award for Latin in the main contest event.
How unfortunate he's not as healthy as you!
Your mother wanted you to get a good education.
Ah... here we are.
I'll spend the entire summer here?
But you'll see, you'll enjoy it here.
Come, let's go see the director.
Say, how long are you staying in Touraine, with your Delage?
My chauffeur is prudent, but still it's almost 3 hours to drive the 220 km.
All the same, it's fantastic. What will they think of next?
This will be your bed.
Please remember to pass along my regards to your wife and to Marceau.
- How is he? - Doing fine.
We hope to bring him home by the end of this summer.
However, with this illness, a Sword of Damocles always hangs above our heads.
I share your concerns.
- Dear uncle, may I... - Two minutes.
Olivier.
I hope you'll be as bright as your cousin.
Uncle, I need to use the toilet!
Have you been following Gorgoulov's trial?
It's an abomination!
Ah, is the child's uniform ready?
It's the right size.
At least, I hope.
Here you go my boy, try this on for me.
He pissed himself!
- Oliver... what's wrong with you?
- Never mind, I'll take care of it.
Come with me, you filthy little boy.
I beg your forgiveness, M. Le directeur.
Make nothing of it.
How long ago did his mother pass away?
4 or 5 months.
I'm worried we might have been a little hasty in all of this.
Would you mind if I kept him for this evening?
No, not at all.
I'll try to cheer him up.
Do you like to go see Mayol, the singer?
Not really, uncle.
What then would please you?
- I'd love to go to the Lapin Agile.
- The cabaret in Montmartre?
That establishment does not allow children.
I used to go with my mother.
"Parlez-moi d'amour
"Redites-moi des choses tendres
"Votre beau discours
"Mon coeur n'est pas las de l'entendre
"Pourvu Que toujours
"Vous répétiez ces mots suprêmes"
It's funny...
The last time I was here with mama, we were sitting at this very table.
Why ever would your mother bring you here?
We came to dance.
Tangos, especially.
Olivier, are you crying?
We should not have come here.
It will only make you miserable. No.
On the contrary.
Careful, Châteauneuf!
Your uncle could have brought you back sooner.
Go to bed now. Go on.
That should teach you not to wake everybody up.
Châteauneuf, don't be a show-off.
I run a quiet dorm and it will stay that way.
We're not in Montmartre.
- But it wasn't me, sir. - Silence!
We don't answer back, Châteauneuf.
And now, go to sleep. Everybody.
You're a snitch, Châteauneuf!
He's from Montmartre.
And already snitching on us!
No one talks to him.
He's now on quarantine.
- Yeah, good idea.
- Silence!
Hey urchin. You can't play with us.
We don't need you.
Debézieux. Well done: 16/20.
Saron, almost perfect.
Once again, you've earned 19.
I kept the best for last.
No, Châteauneuf did not get 20.
After only 2 months, I wouldn't expect as much from him.
Luckily for him, there are no marks below zero, because Châteauneuf would have scored -6.5.
And for your enjoyment, I will demonstrate how Châteauneuf... translates the famous phrase:
"If you want peace
"prepare for war."
You haven't made any progress during the summer, Châteauneuf.
Being Mr. Desrousseau's nephew or not, you are not exempt from being intelligent.
Follow your cousin Marceau's example. He was my best student.
Good morning, Olivier.
I'm Marceau, your cousin.
We've met at the house on a few occasions.
It's pretty hard to forget.
My Latin teacher never stops talking about you.
Good morning, Marceau.
No need to be formal, lad.
You're a poet?
We'll understand each other!
"Child of a fallen leaf,
"subjected to every wind
"as the weeks and months of summer pass
"wrapped in the sheets of my friends' solitude
"I call the names of Bougras, Mado, I'Araignée
"No answer to be heard. They have forgotten me.
"And so I ask:
What has become of them?
"You, my parents as distant as strangers be
"What secrets have you not dared share with me?"
Inspired by Rutebeuf, and a bit of a tearjerker, but... given your situation, this piece is fitting.
That poem is private!
Perhaps I should teach you the finer aspects of caesura.
I don't need your help.
Couldn't I be of use to you in Latin?
- What about your sister?
- Mind your own business.
I'm starting to like you, obscure little friend.
I was afraid you would bore me.
My parents dumped you here for the whole summer?
Ah, the bastards!
They could have brought you with them to Touraine at least!
I sympathize. I spent the last 8 months in the sanatorium.
I'm cured, finally. I'm just out and I bring you back home!
Isn't life beautiful?
The headmaster will never consent.
You're mother picks me up tomorrow.
Nihil obstat.
I've just seen the principal, and, between two Latin quotes, I've told him that my mother had instructed me to take you home. You are free.
I release you from the bonds of slavery.
Long live freedom!
Long live André Breton!
- Who's this Breton?
- The pope of surrealism, of course!
The pope of what? My God!
I'll need to tend to your education.
You are now entering the Holy of Holies.
You may enter.
You are familiar with this apartment? Yes.
I mean not that familiar.
You must always look impressed by the luxury... of good standing that is the foundation of my parent's success.
They're really quite vain.
Mother, especially.
She's a great lady, my mother.
She's wonderful!
I'm often angry with her, but I adore her anyway.
As for my father, he's a dreamer who can't get over having become a successful businessman.
This is the living room.
- You know what he really wanted to be?
- An opera singer.
- How did you know that?
- Because he told me, of course!
- We went to the Lapin agile together.
- That's just like him!
He took advantage of you to get away.
You've already reached a level of trust with him?
Yes, but he doesn't want me talking about it.
To my mother, perhaps.
As for me, you can talk about anything.
This is the dining room.
Impressive.
Come, I'll take you to your room.
Put your luggage on the bed and follow me.
And this... is my lair.
You like jazz?
Are you familiar with The Duke?
What about Louis Armstrong?
No, not him either.
He's giving a Paris concert at the end of this month.
Can you believe it?
Either way, I'm going to meet him this year.
My parents have offered me a trip to New York for my holidays.
Getting sick does have its advantage: your parents will grant your every wish.
I'm going to spend New Year's Eve at the Cotton Club...
But I have a friend who's living in New York!
His name is David Zober.
I have no news of him.
Well then, give me his address.
I will find this little buddy of yours.
Are you familiar with benzoin?
Take a seat.
You'll get to know it.
- It's an intoxicating oil.
- For cooking?
I'm talking about the mind, not the body.
Do you like this piece?
Yeah, really cool.
Indubitably!
Duke Ellington!
Isn't this dangerous for someone with tuberculosis.
That, my dear, is the least of my worries.
Besides, I'm cured.
- You've never smoked before?
- Yes, quite often.
Some "Ich Lif" .
My God, what an accent!
High Life! "Vie élevée."
High Life.
You will experience the elevation of souls, the communion of spirits.
You see, me... I would come across as a type of Lafcadio.
- The Vatican Cellars.
André Gide.
You know him? - No.
The perfect crime.
When you think of it, the sanatorium had its merits.
I learned the two things a man must lose in his life.
His virginity and his illusions.
"There, everything is order and beauty,
"Luxury, serenity and voluptuousness."
What is voluptuousness?
That is about to manifest.
Don't move, I'll be right back.
Olivier.
I'd like you to meet Julienne, my mother's god-daughter, resident of the Demoiselles de la Légion d'honneur.
She holds my mother's dearest fervor... when it comes to my marriage.
- Julienne, I'd like to present...
- I know him, Marceau.
- You're the one who's mother died.
- Yes, that's me.
Out of kindness my parents decided to adopt him.
Would you like a benzoin ciggy?
My feet are killing me.
Saint-Denis is quite the walking distance.
Olivier, make yourself useful.
Julienne has sore feet.
Remove her shoes.
Come on, hurry up.
Slowly, Olivier!
Unlace them gently.
Give them a massage.
My feet are really sore.
Don't tickle me.
Just give me a massage.
Have you ever seen a woman before?
Have you ever seen a woman's breasts?
Oh, you little scoundrel!
You're a pervert!
How dare you!
This is not your place.
Now go to your room!
Scram!
Write me a poem about Julienne's breasts.
- Ma'am, where would you like this luggage?
- Carry them to my room.
Marguerite, tell the chauffeur to bring in the apples last.
We'll put them in the store room.
Which is Master Olivier's room, now
Very well, madame.
Good day, mother.
Did you have a nice trip? - Excellent!
Where were you?
- At the restaurant, with Olivier.
We weren't going to die of starvation awaiting your return.
Give me a hug instead of making vile remarks.
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.
Let me have a look at you.
You're right, you do look well.
Why did you bring Olivier back a day sooner?
You could have let me know.
I could have avoided the detour to the college.
Listen, he'd been couped up long enough, don't you think?
Good day, Olivier.
Good day, aunt.
I suppose Marceau has already given you the grand tour?
He has, yes.
Very well. We'll now go to your room.
Since you are here, I will give you...
- The house rules!
- That's mean!
I hope you'll be comfortable here.
This is where we keep the apples that we bring back... every year from our estate in Montrichard.
Fortunately for you, the harvest was not abundant this year.
I hope you like apple sauce and apple pie.
Here we eat it all the time.
- These are your belongings?
- Yes, aunt.
But they reek!
Well, we'll need to get rid of them.
Including the clothes you are wearing.
I will let you have Marceau's old things. You can tell mother is from Auvergne:
to her, a spade is a spade.
My dear child, you used to be more witty.
- These books are yours?
- Yes, aunt.
Marie Bashkirtseff?
How unexpected!
Schopenhauer?
You mean you're reading this at your age?
- No, aunt.
- It so happens he has... a certain culture.
I've read one of his poems. It's quite good.
Anyway, what he needs most is a good bath.
I will ask Marguerite to wash him in the laundry room. That's right.
We wouldn't want him staining the bathtub.
Come on, Marguerite, scrub harder. He's got to shine like a new penny.
Your cousin is a cute little angel.
- More so than moi, Marguerite?
- That's not the same thing.
You're a man, now.
Alright, Olivier.
Come out and dry yourself.
Hop, hop!
Voilà!
I say, aren't we a wee bit scrawny, my little urchin?
I'm going to burn your clothes like Madame said.
Show me, Olivier.
Now, turn around.
It's funny seeing you wear my old trappings.
"Trappings"?
Ah, what an astute word.
Do I detect Montmartre's influence?
Marceau, your father and I decided... to prepare a little surprise for your homecoming.
Julienne will join us for dinner this evening.
She will be happy to see you.
She spoke so often of you.
Your father is picking her up at the print shop after work.
- Are you pleased?
- Yes, mother.
I burn!
Oh how I languish for Julienne!
I love her, not as in the Underworld, the ravager of a thousand men, But faithful, proud and a little diffident!
The divine...
- Good evening.
- Good evening, monsieur.
godmother!
Good evening, godmother.
My dear, how happy I am to see you.
And I'm not the only one.
Marceau is thrilled that you could join us for his homecoming.
It's been such a long time since you've last seen each other.
I even wondered if I would recognize you!
It's now been over a year.
Seems to me like it was yesterday.
And your father, do you recognize him?
A your age you only change every 10 years.
At my age?
Am I that old?
Anyway, you have a much better disposition than when you left.
Good to see you.
Let us have dinner so that Julienne doesn't get home too late.
I must get you to test drive my new Delage.
Julienne.
Where's Olivier's setting?
He's eating with the maids, of course.
Why then did you tell him he was a member of the family?
They cured his illness, but apparently not his character.
Marceau, return immediately to the dining room.
Your stew is truly marvelous, Blanche.
Thank you, M. Marceau.
For the last time, return to the dining room.
Delicious, don't you think?
Blanche, see to it that M. Olivier joins us in the dining room.
- Yes, madame.
- Dear aunt, there's is no need.
Oh please, don't give me that!
Look, Olivier.
Like this.
Sorry, aunt.
It's not your fault, Olivier.
Take note however that we don't say: "sorry", but "Please excuse me."
In conclusion, Olivier, we are too good for you.
Well my friend, say something.
Be nice to your mother, Marceau.
What is that dress you're wearing?
Rochas? Poiret?
No, Schiaparelli.
What else you'd like to know?
I do like it.
- However... - Yes?
Your necklace doesn't suit it.
A little flashy, don't you think?
We can discuss it further after our meal, if you like.
Excellent idea, mother.
Besides, after our little cafe, you and Julienne could play us a duet?
With pleasure, god-mother.
With pleasure, mother.
With pleasure, aunt.
Olivier!
If you want us to keep you, you must change your attitude.
Go to your room immediately.
- But, aunt...
- Immediately!
Very well, aunt.
You're worse than Hitler.
Marceau, illness doesn't excuse everything.
I need no excuses, mother. And I'm not longer ill.
Marceau...
Marceau!
Marceau, wake up!
Please, wake up!
I'm okay. Don't move.
You had a spell.
I'll get your mother.
No, Olivier.
You didn't see a thing.
But it might be serious.
You must see a doctor.
Listen, Olivier.
All the tests indicate I am cured.
Makes no sense to worry mother over a sudden fatigue.
Olivier, if you are a brother to me, swear you'll never speak about this to anyone.
Come on, swear it.
I swear, Marceau.
Thanks, Olivier.
...we are pleased to have him join a jam session, a big round of applause for Mister...
Louis Armstrong!
I just cut my lip.
Don't mention anything to my Divine.
You swear?
Dear students, some of you might wonder why... you would need to learn Latin.
The pope, monsieur. No.
Now pick a word at random. - Light. - Perfect example of Latin roots.
Light comes from the word Lux, the light.
Something that is Lux-urious is something that is brilliant.
Your turn to choose a word, Châteauneuf.
Poetry.
Poetry comes from the Latin word poesis, which in turn comes from the Greek poïesis, meaning creation.
Delépine, which word would you like to know the root of?
Football.
Now here's an example of a barbaric term we adopted, let alone its simple translation in our language.
"Football", in our language should mean:
ball at the foot, from the Latin pedibus, meaning foot and... Excuse me...
Medical examination visit.
- I said in silence. - Visit. From the word vis.
To see. And medical, from Medicus, the doctor.
Châteauneuf? Yes, that's me.
- This is a surprise, Olivier! - Good day, Mr. Lehman.
I mean, doctor.
- I was about to ask you the same thing.
So did I. The number of patients I had in my care was dwindling;
Good, now open wide.
I hate myself for what happened to your mother.
Perhaps I didn't do enough for her.
- You didn't like me very much, did you?
- Well...
Believe me, I didn't want to take your father's place, Olivier.
I just wanted to help your mother. In any event, she didn't like you.
I think she did a bit. Now, sit straight.
For you it's very sad. She died so young.
I see your aunt is taking good care of you.
Everything is fine.
You're in perfect health. That's it. You can get dressed, now.
Thank you, doctor.
Tell me doctor?
- I would like to ask you...
- Yes?
When people get... when they come down with tuberculosis, can they get sick again, even after being cured?
Of course.
The terrible thing about this illness, a real cure still hasn't been found.
If we cough up blood, it means we're still sick?
Yes, and it's really serious.
It's typical, as are repeated coughs, and sometimes even loss of consciousness.
- Is it contagious?
- Oh yes, extremely contagious! But why are you asking me this? Well...
I want to write a poem on tuberculosis.
On tuberculosis? Yes, why not?
It's true, Lamartine...
La Dame aux camélias. Thank you, doctor.
You'll make yourself sick reading so much!
Are those shoes ready yet, Marguerite?
Yes, all done, madame.
Good evening, Olivier.
Reading is a healthy habit, Olivier, but not at the table.
What are you reading?
Still reading Without Family!
But I gave you that one over a month ago.
I love reading it over again.
Granted. But there are other books more essential.
You look lovely, dear aunt.
Well, aren't you the gallant one!
This evening gown is for the French Club.
Henri is taking me. You should say to the "Comédie
- Française", mother.
How could he possibly understand, he's unversed.
I know it's Saturday, but getting up at sunset is a bit exaggerated, don't you think?
Mother, I'm preparing myself for the time difference.
It is now 11 o'clock in New York. Don't plan too far ahead, Marceau.
Your trip is not official yet. Don't forget.
Come, my little outcast, I need to speak with you.
Thank you, Marguerite. You won't believe what's happening to me.
I'm in love! I met a woman yesterday at a Party gathering.
- What Party?
- The Communist Party!
You know, the Reds. She's simply amazing.
A mix between Louise Brooks and Rosa Luxemburg.
She's a surrealist like me.
A dream come true.
There's just one problem: she's 15 years older.
I want to read you a poem I wrote her.
"Crimson heart, pierced by faith,
"May he who has never loved you never reach your depth."
Not bad for a start, don't you think? I'm brilliant.
Go ahead, tell me.
"Marceau, you're brilliant."
- Marceau, you're brilliant.
- Oh no, it's pathetic.
You can't really understand poetry. You're stuck on Victor Hugo or Leconte de Lisle.
You know nothing about women.
You've never been in love.
I know nothing about women?
Her name is Mado.
And she's a taxi-girl. - Besides, we're engaged.
- Come on.
Don't make up stories just to try to impress me.
You'll see if I'm telling the truth. You'll see. Come.
Here.
Rinse your eyes on this.
She gave it me as a memento.
To someone else, you mean!
You probably stole it from your mother's boutique.
Nice piece, though.
And this is her calling card.
- She gave it to me personally.
You surprise me.
- Are you still seeing this Mado?
- Of course not.
Not since my arrival here. Don't look so sad.
We'll fix that.
- Very pretty! Look. I just started a new novel.
- Can you read it to me?
- Yes, of course.
"I was born, like everyone, from a mother and a father.
"And yet, I am not like everyone.
"One question haunts me:
"did my father and mother love each other?
"Were I not conceived in a state of love, I would rather die."
- You asked me to. You shouldn't!
You're violating my intimacy.
You're a little pervert! You shouldn't have... You don't understand!
It's not because you're older...
You wouldn't strike a sick person, would you?
That's just it, you're really sick.
- Dr Lehman says you're having a relapse. - What? Who's this Dr. Lehman?
You mentioned me?
It's the college physician.
I asked him about tuberculosis.
I know what happened to you the other day.
You were losing consciousness.
If you're spitting blood, it's serious and contagious.
You should inform your parents.
I see where you're going with this.
You want to stop me from leaving, send me back to the sanatorium and take my place, here.
- You're crazy, Marceau. - Hypocrite!
You think I didn't catch your little act with mother?
"You look lovely, dear aunt."
- Ass-licker.
- I'm doing it for you!
Don't forget you promised me your silence.
You're like a brother to me.
I owe you one.
Forgive me, mother.
I rather stop here.
I thought you had finally shed the awkward age, but you still revel in it.
Spare me your cliches.
My dear, your son is extremely rude right now.
Marceau, please!
If you want to go on your trip, you better clean up your act.
You are wanted on the telephone.
Hello! Oh yes.
Yes. I know who this is.
Listen, it's a delicate issue for me.
Good.
I will be there in 15 minutes, under the arches.
Let me see Olivier.
- He's not your child. - I know that. But I could be just like a father to him.
He chose not to go with you.
But he's no longer in his favorite neighbourhood.
Please stop right there, monsieur Privat. My wife would never allow it.
On what grounds?
You didn't take him in out of love.
Put yourself in her place.
You came to our home to kill your brother and Virginie.
And now you would want to take their son?
I didn't kill anyone.
And I spent time behind bars.
Thirteen years of my life.
I need this child to give meaning to my life.
But does he need you?
Even if we handed him over to you, think of what people would say.
Believe me, I can understand your pain.
But think about the day Olivier will learn everything about your past.
I'm certain he will be able to forgive me.
But once you tell him the whole truth, you'll be shattering the image he has of his parents.
Do you think you have the right to do that?
There's a ladder in the courtyard.
You climb up, and down the other side using the street lamp.
A 5 year-old could do it. There you'll see a bike.
You get on it, and within 10 minutes you wind up at the Bouchon de Champagne.
Here.
Here's some money to have a good time.
I'll take your place, in case the supervisor can't sleep.
I don't think I can pull it off.
I'm too scared.
I've done it dozens of times without ever getting caught.
"Audaces fortuna juvat", Olivier.
It's time to see if your life will be that of a sheep, or if you will write it yourself, every day.
Don't you want to see Mado again?
Good evening, mam'zelle Mado Good evening, m'sieur Hubert.
That wasn't very smart.
Are you angry with me?
Not at all!
I'm actually moved.
You can't follow me inside, though.
Now there, don't be sad.
Wait, I have an idea.
Jules?
Ask G.G. to come out with his accordion.
- I have a little commission for him.
Give him 10 francs, he'll be happy.
- I'll give him 20! - No, that's too much. You asked for me, Mado?
Yes, G.G. Here's a young client for you.
What shall I play for you?
Olivier, what would you like? A tango!
A tango for my little fiance.
The Most Beautiful Tango in The World?
- Yes, that's fine.
- I'm not a very good dancer.
I was forced, and this is only a temporary measure of course, to confiscate this elegant pen which arrived in the mail. - It was intended for Olivier?
- Indeed, madame.
In this college, we discourage possession of valuable objects... which would risk to excite the greed of certain pupils... towards their more fortunate peers.
I thought it might be you.
I'm not in the habit of spoiling children with gifts of this value.
- May I see Olivier? - By all means. I've already sent for him.
He's waiting in the vestibule.
Come in, Olivier.
I leave you together.
Good day, aunt. Who sent you this pen?
I...
I don't know, aunt.
Don't lie to me, Olivier.
It could only have come from him.
Have the courage to tell me the truth.
Yes.
It is a gift from Monsieur Privat.
I will send it back. You must never accept anything from this man.
But why not, aunt?
You're too young to know about these things.
But I need to know!
Since you put it like that, I'll tell you.
One day, in December of 1917, the war was still raging,
Privat came to my home where your parents were staying and fired his gun.
- He wanted to kill them, Olivier.
I don't believe you. Why was my mother intent on living with him?
I'm still trying to figure that out. Your mother and I never saw eye to eye on many things.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
I didn't want you to get upset.
I hope we never have to discuss this matter ever again.
Anyway, sooner or later, you would have found out.
Enter.
Of course you will.
Because you are pure.
Wild child.
Street child.
- Please stop gloating at my expense! - You see, she dropped me. Who did?
This militant girl who wrote these pathetic lines.
I'm down to listening to this music for rejected lovers.
All around me,
"everything is order and beauty."
And yet, my pain is real. Why?
Marceau...
You knew about... about my parents and Privat?
What are you talking about?
Well...
The time Privat... the time he came here.
Your mother told me the story. The Divine finally coughed it up?
Yes.
Privat fired shots at them.
In fact, it happened right here.
In this very room where your parents stayed. I was only 2 at the time.
But look.
Look at the mirror.
Impacts left by the bullets.
See where love can lead?
A few centimeters to the side... and you'd never have been born, my little outcast.
But rest assured,
Why didn't you tell me?
Because this story is boring as hell, my friend.
Two grown men love the same woman. An ordinary drama based on jealousy.
You're mama was nothing more than a small-time goddess, as my mother put it.
Come on, cheer up.
I don't want to see you suffer, my little angel. Please spare me your expressions of grandeur!
We are both injured and abandoned souls.
Like two starlings fallen from the nest.
Yes?
M. Marceau, a girl is asking for you.
- A girl? - Mlle Charlotte Dalet. Charlotte?
Have her come in, quick!
A woman leaves me, I find another. - Who is she?
- The nurse from the sanatorium. - The one who...
- Who taught me how to love. - You know what you have to do?
- Change wards.
- Good day, Marceau.
- Charlotte! What a joy to see you again!
I'll give you some privacy.
Stop it, Marceau.
So, if I can't kiss you, what brings you to Paris?
I shouldn't be telling you this, but I don't want to deceive you.
The director will be sending a letter to your parents.
A letter?
Whatever for? You're having a serious relapse, Marceau.
The lab you visit for your routine check-ups... has sent us the results of your samples.
The samples indicate you are once again infected.
But you said I had been cured.
The pneumothorax was extremely effective.
But when it comes to tuberculosis, you can never be sure. I must go back to the sanatorium?
I'm afraid so.
Upon your release, you registered less than 1000 BK.
But today, you must be well over 100.000! It's a serious relapse.
You must start a new treatment.
Worst of all, you could have infected your entire family.
I understand why you wouldn't let me kiss you.
How convenient for you.
You can work on my case.
I'll be once again your little patient. I'll be there with you.
Every hour, every second! - You have no right to say that!
Even if the truth is painful to hear. So there, goodbye!
Are we eavesdropping, now?
I'm expecting a love letter.
- You're at that age!
- See you.
Well, well. A letter for Olivier.
It's from America.
Nothing for me.
I am gloom, the grieving inconsolable widower.
"The Prince of Aquitaine at the forsaken tower!"
Marceau the early bird.
- I hope you're not ill, at least.
Of course not, mother.
I feel great!
What's with him this morning?
He must be in love, madame.
Good for him.
But not a word about this to Julienne.
Get up, lazy- bones!
Even though we're on vacation, we don't get up any later.
America?
Thank you, Marguerite.
It's from David.
He must have quite a few stories to share!
There are tons of postcards!
- Skyscrapers! - And even photos.
Show me.
The mail has arrived?
Obviously, because you received your letter.
- But, Marceau?
- Monsieur Marceau?
You're not going to read your letter?
- Did he get mail this morning?
- No.
He was so disappointed his new sweetheart hadn't written to him.
What are you doing?
I'm depositing the 2nd mail batch, as I always do at noon.
There is a 2nd mail run?
Of course. This is Paris!
Since you're going back to college I advise you to take a Balzac.
It will take you all week to read "Les Illusions perdues".
or even "La Cousine Bette".
Good morning, father.
I just received a letter that concerns you. Really?
You know what it might be about? No, I can't think of anything. You know, this American friend I wrote to...?
Well, he agreed.
He would be happy to have you stay with him for as long as you wish.
I can now confirm your travel arrangements.
You will embark on the De Grâce, on the morning of December 16.
- Happy? - You bet!
Your mother and I are sad you won't spend Christmas with us.
But more important, we want you to be happy. You'll see, Mr. DeWilde will make good company.
What does he do for a living? He owns a few movie theaters in New York.
They call them Nickelodeons.
Ah yes, the penny cinema.
Here's one... A letter from the sanatorium.
I have a hunch I know what it's about.
It's what I thought.
Well they've got some nerve!
They're claiming reimbursement for a window pane I broke by accident.
Medical services are already expensive. They should cover that.
I'll call the director immediately.
Hello, mademoiselle?
Get me number 16 at St - Pierre - Les
- Bains, Haute - Loire.
Marceau Desrousseau speaking.
I'd like to speak to the director, please. Thank you.
I beg you, Marceau, be diplomatic.
Take the receiver.
And learn from the master.
Hello? Mister director?
Yes:
No, not very well.
My parents just received a letter from your accounting department.
It claims reimbursement of a window pane I accidentally broke.
It was a mistake?
I'm happy to hear it.
I will let you take care of it.
Thank you, mister director.
Give my best to madame.
Goodbye. You had gall.
Yes, you went straight to the point!
From now on, I will have you deal directly with my creditors.
With pleasure, father.
Monsieur is served.
You're crazy, Marceau.
Voila.
Tell me what you think.
"concerning the state of health of our son.
"in a sanatorium close to Paris.
"As soon as we can, we will inform you of the...
"address of this establishment,
"so that you may share with them our son's medical records.
"Yours truly..." etc.
Pretty good, right? You're out of your mind, Marceau.
You can't do that.
Charlotte said it would be suicide.
Charlotte says that to keep me in the sanatorium. As you can see, I'm in good health.
That's not true, Marceau. Even yesterday I could hear you coughing.
Excuse me.
I must mail this at once.
Stand up!
Stand up! Companions in misery.
- What's going on, Olivier?
- I want you to stay out of this. - You'll be able to go back...
- Once you're back to health.
- Nothing could be more uncertain.
So I would prefer being overseas.
I would rather die at the Cotton Club instead of the asylum.
You won't say a word about it to my parents.
You promised.
Yes, but I didn't know just how serious this is.
Not to say the number of people you can contaminate.
I will tell them everything. If you do, I'll tell them of your outing to Mado.
They'll send you to your grandpa's to become a blacksmith's apprentice.
You're such a bastard.
I don't give a damn! - I don't want you to die, you understand?
- I think you just want me to stay here.
You wouldn't have the balls.
Just wait and see.
- Who is it? - It's me, Olivier.
Come in.
Something really serious.
Well, what is it?
It's, hm...
I'm sorry I didn't make it to the circus on my birthday.
That's it?
You scared me. It was quickly forgotten, Olivier.
I forgive you, of course.
You must get up early tomorrow. The holidays are over.
Yes, aunt.
Such a strange boy.
Ah! If he had Marceau's education!
If Marceau had his state of health!
- So that's it. You're going to play me like a violin, now?
Really, you're not sparing me anything.
You think I'm going to roll over like a dog? "Don't go, I'll spill the beans"
You're totally wrong.
Here, you forgot you beret.
You'll be back within the hour.
You read too much "Without Family".
You should reflect on the difference between literature and reality.
- Farewell, Marceau.
Wake up, Olivier. It's time!
It's 7 o'clock.
But...
Olivier?
- You haven't seen him? - No.
Not this morning. Yes.
He told me he had to leave to review his Latin.
I helped him till past midnight.
He was probably intent on leaving without waking me.
I came to tell you he's ill.
A simple phone call would have sufficed.
I have fond memories of this place.
I didn't want to miss the opportunity.
As for your cousin, I hope it's nothing serious.
I was their family physician in Montmartre.
Yes of course, Montmartre.
Hey! guys!
They should count their forts.
We should have some enemies.
We were once at peace, but everybody got confused.
Hey! Wait for me.
You're not fighting anymore with the riffraff of Bachelet St.?
That's ancient history!
Let's go, I'm starved. See you! See you Capdeverre.
I'm hungry too.
See you later! See you, Loulou.
Don't you look dapper in those god awful pants!
So long.
I need some grub too.
So long, Riri.
Bougras!
M'sieur Bougras!
- Where to? - I have no idea.
If you see him again, tell him... he ran a pigsty in here.
It reeked as hell!
No problem, young man.
They're in a rush and I'm under the gun.
- Jean is fine?
- Not so bad. - Did he find work?
- Yes.
Yes. And how is the baby?
- Leg of lamb "Soissons".
- Coming up. - You were saying?
- You're baby, how's he doing? An apple pudding with Leg of Lamb "Soissons".
Bon appétit.
The baby?
He's adorable.
He's with Mrs. Hacque.
She's babysitting. Go see him!
Will do, Elodie.
So long, Elodie.
Glazier!
He's a bit like your cousin.
Isn't he the cutest?
I often take care of him.
Poor Elodie never stops.
And with Jean without a steady job, and he likes to drink a bit.
In the end, you did well to leave.
- But I was forced to leave!
- Well, you know what I mean.
You were such a hooligan!
Your aunt and uncle... do they treat you well?
Yes, madame Hacque.
In retrospect, your mother's death...
I wouldn't say it was a lucky break, far from it, mothers are irreplaceable.
But for your future...
Often we say: a blessing in disguise.
Ah, here comes Elodie.
It's me, my little treasure!
My love, it's your mama.
I came to tell you I won't be off work until 2:30pm.
He's a real cakewalk your little cherub.
You gave me a hell of a scare my little angel.
That's too easy.
You're a bastard, Marceau.
You think you can just die off like that?
Do whatever you like with your life?
Didn't you think about the others?
Your parents? Julienne?
Me?
What will become of me if you... if you die? Now, now.
Don't worry so much.
That's enough.
You want me to say you're right.
Is that it? I have given it some thought.
I decided I'll talk to my parents.
You're lying. Hang on, my Doubting Thomas.
You want my passport?
They're yours.
Without them, I can't go. It's a trick.
You'll only take them back!
What else do you need, then?
- Give it to me.
- It's a trick!
I'll show you a trick.
So, little outcast?
Happy now?
Dear Olivier,
The landscape hasn't changed much in the last 6 months.
Boredom here has reached a new philosophical dimension.
Luckily, the pain from the pneumothorax keeps me awake.
I'm so jaded that seeing your face again would bring back my spirits.
And so, if you can, please come.
The sanatorium is near Saugués. Find a way to get sent away to live with your grandpa.
I wait for you, my Olive, without fail. - Marceau
This morning, therefore, the supervisor found Olivier's scarf in the yard.
Yes, and what of it?
It was found at the bottom of the gardener's ladder... which was leaning against the school wall, ostensibly in order to jump over to the other side.
Furthermore, in doing Olivier's bed, the chambermaid found this.
I judged it would be best to notify you before talking to Olivier.
You don't think that Olivier... Mister director, I know him. I can't imagine him doing such a thing.
And yet, the evidence is obvious. I'd say a little too obvious.
Do you believe, mister director, that a student jumping the wall would leave the ladder behind?
moreover his scarf bearing his name?
Or keeping such compromising evidence in the dormitory?
I would rather think he was the target of a prank.
A very bad schoolboy prank. I think my husband is correct in his assessment, mister director.
Our nephew knows what fate would await him should he do such a thing.
We would send him off to his grandparents, in Auvergne.
You're probably right.
I should have known better. If one of our students was bent on tarnishing the image of your nephew, rest assured he will be punished accordingly.
I will deal with this matter immediately.
What happened in 1685?
Delépine! The assassination of Henri IV by Ravaillac, monsieur.
He would have been mighty, this Ravaillac, to assassinate a king who had been dead for 75 years!
Yes, Susse!
1685, revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV, sir.
Well done. Now, what happened in...
Be seated, children.
I'm here to discuss a serious matter.
It would appear that one of you... wanted to get Châteauneuf accused of jumping the wall.
His scarf was left behind in the yard as evidence... and other objects I won't mention at this time, were planted in his personal belongings in the dormitory.
"A fault confessed is half redressed". Gentlemen!
I'm waiting.
Châteauneuf, you would like to speak?
Nobody played a trick on me, sir.
I did jump the wall last night.
I don't want the entire class punished on my account.
- And where did you go? - To see a friend.
The girlies!
- What do you mean: "the girlies"?
- The streetwalkers, sir.
Olivier!
Shame on you! You're a disgrace.
I don't want you living with us anymore.
At least you don't look like a hooligan!
Come on, let's go.
Ho, Victor!
Can't this wait?
- She's all yours, Antonin. - You're holding us up.
Adios!
Give it to me.
You will call me "Tonton".
And that girl... not a word about her to granny.
All right, Tonton.
You'll see. There isn't much here to lift grannie's spirits.
She's not thrilled with your arrival.
With grandpa, it's different.
He just loves telling stories.
So he's happy that you're coming.
Besides, since injuring his leg, he's been bored stiff.
Listen, I must teach you a phrase in "patois", and you will repeat it to him.
Oh, Gustou, beni fara monegue. Say it.
Oh, Gustou, beni fara monegue.
We don't have much time for you to learn it.
We're here. There's the "oustaou".
- Go on, say the phrase.
- Oh, Gustou, beni fara monegue.
"Allo pitchou"!
Let me look at you.
You have your father's eyes. Come on in!
I prepared a snack for you.
You must be hungry after your trip.
Here were are.
Over here, it's not like at Victoria's.
It will be a lot different than my daughter's apartment.
There. You'll see.
We can be quite comfortable here, too. Sit over here.
We'll get you something to eat. Here.
This will be your pocket knife.
You must give a coin in return.
It's the custom.
- Will this do, Tonton?
It's not for the money.
It's to preserve friendship.
You're grandma isn't here.
She's picking mushrooms.
And a bit of water, of course!
Well, then?
- How is it, good?
- Victor, where are you?
See that door, it's your room.
You can put your things.
Will you show him how to forge?
Yes, you can watch me smith iron.
And if you're not too tired, you can give me a hand.
See you later, Tonton.
I say, you look a bit pale to me.
Don't worry, here you'll soon get back your color.
Here comes grannie.
Victor didn't warn you? She's a bit of a grouch.
She doesn't like kissing very much.
Give grandma a hug, Olivier.
Careful! Dummy, you'll make the mushrooms tip over.
- We're in for a treat tonight!
- No. You'll have to wait until Sunday.
So?
Are you the little scamp my daughter went crazy over?
Anyway, he's a good boy.
And very polite if you can believe it.
We'll see.
He's one of the best blacksmiths in the country.
Okay, grandpa.
Ah.
There you are.
- This one?
- Yes, it will stir the fire.
In 2 months, you'll have man's muscles!
You can stop now, Olivier.
You should tour the stable and say hi to the cows.
You'll find 3. They're kind.
There's Dourade, the most assured.
Then, La Marcade, and finally, Poumérade, the one with the spots. - Where is the stable?
- In the back.
You can go.
Hello cows!
How are you?
And you, La Marcade. And you are La Dourade.
How are you, Poumérade?
Let me introduce myself.
Normally I live in Montmartre.
What are you doing here?
Get out of here, you hear me?
He knows what to expect, now. If that bandit ever comes near the farm again.
What is the sense of adding misery to misery?
Come on, now. He provoked me, right? I didn't start anything.
- We must understand him. - Understand him!
If you can understand a criminal, you can understand me as well.
If he ever comes close to the lad he knows what to expect.
I thought your god was the god of forgiveness.
Leave my god alone! I'm taking the animals to the fields.
Make sure the boy doesn't leave the farm unaccompanied.
Why not? He's not in prison, here.
You read what Victoria wrote in her letter:
you must never leave that little scoundrel out of your sight!
You'd think Victoria makes the rules in my home!
Could you please call "pitchou"?
Olivier! Go see your grandfather.
Right, read me that article.
"The Nazi party stated that the Germans have rallied in great numbers...
"by Adolf Hitler to burn all books deemed subversive...
"and decadent in the public square.
"Several million books were reduced to ashes on the morning of May 5."
You see, Olivier, when the world's train leaves its tracks, no one knows where it will stop.
Why would anyone want to burn books?
They bring no harm. They don't want people to think! They're being groomed to be like machines.
But tell me, you read very well, how can you be doing so poorly in class, at least according to your aunt Victoria?
- I don't know, grandpa. - You don't know...
Furthermore, it seems you sneak out of the college at night. You're a real Escoulas!
In our family we always had rebels.
Look at me: I'm the only Red in this country of Whites!
Say, grandpa?
Yes?
The sanatorium where Marceau is staying, it's in this region, right?
I say, you go straight to the point.
You've been here less than a day and already you want to go to the sanatorium.
Tell me, did you come here to see Marceau?
- Yes, grandpa. - It's good to tell the truth. But...
Victoria was very clear that under no circumstance... you were to go to the sanatorium.
But why would she object?
She must have her reasons. You see, we're alike.
You think so?
And why is that?
Because I want to see Marceau too! I really miss my grandson.
He grew up here.
Always running after girls in the hills, and fishing for trout or crayfish.
We had some great times, him and me.
But now, it only hurts to know he's there.
The doctor told me I couldn't go, that I could catch his illness.
But mark my words:
we're going to see him together! - Really? - As real as I am an Escoulas.
I looked at the map, it's about 50 km.
We're not going to take the road.
The mountain trails will save us at least 10 km.
We'll take a horse and buggy, and I'll tell them I'm taking you to the animal fair in Langeac.
Will they let us go?
They'll say I'm crazy. But I'm head of this family. - I can do what I want, right?
- Yes, grandpa! Hold on.
Don't get your spirits too high.
I need to know if you can keep a secret.
With Victor and grannie, you have to act a bit, show them you're not really thrilled about coming with me.
- Right. - Good.
We shouldn't arouse their suspicions.
We'll leave Sunday at dawn.
But until then...
That means we won't arrive before nightfall. They'll figure out we didn't go to Langeac.
So what?
Once I've seen Marceau, they can think what they want.
I don't care.
At least we're lucky, the weather's on our side.
Hopefully we won't get caught in the storm before we reach the pass.
Let's go, Nono. Let's go!
That's it, grandpa!
- I gave him some oats. - That's good.
- Here.
Let's have a little feast!
Some ham, bread and wine.
That's my Holy Trinity.
You see, whatever Victoria might think,
I wouldn't trade a single tree from these mountains... for all the lights in Paris.
Say, grandpa? Why doesn't grannie like being kissed? You must understand her.
She lost 2 children.
That made her a little colder.
If you had known her when she was in her 20s, She was beautiful. A real eye-popper.
You know, for our marriage, we undertook the white stick ceremony.
The white stick ceremony?
What's that? If the fiancee placed a broom on its flip-side against her door, it meant she didn't want you.
- That is so funny.
- You think so? Damn it! I didn't sleep all night.
But the next morning, grannie had turned all the brooms on the farm on the right side.
And even the filthy ones.
If only she could hear me!
At the time, she just loved clinging to my arm as we danced.
What are you wishing for, young mountaineer? What did you hope to acquire if you are unwilling to dance?
Qué volio cerca, jovo de la montagna?
Que volio cerca, Si volio pas danser? If you didn't want to dance, you should not have come.
Aïe! Grandpa!
- I tripped, Olivier.
- Come, come. Come, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
Just give me a hand.
Serves me right for playing the young man.
There.
I'm breathing better and I'll be alright.
We still have... 2 km uphill.
The road will be easier after that.
And what if it's m'sieur Privat?
We'll say hi anyway.
- But he tried to kill my parents!
- So what? You don't fire a gun at people without a reason.
Have you ever asked yourself why he did that?
Grandpa! It's Uncle Victor.
That's a different matter.
- You think I don't see through this?
You'll never get to the sanatorium before nightfall.
It's madness. What do you mean?
Is it madness to want to see my grandson?
- You're the one that's crazy!
- I might be crazy... but you're turning around and I come with you.
And you, Olivier, don't try that again or I'll bust your ass.
And not a word to your grandma, she'll gouge your eyes out.
I bought a 6 lb ham at Fayet's.
Let's go.
You see, the word solitude, it only takes one "l" .
Because it's all alone, you see!
You didn't conjugate correctly the past tense of the verb "shoot".
Tell me why! Because it's an exception. It's an irregular verb.
Then why couldn't you get that right? I forgot.
On top of that you misspelled the proper name of the bandit.
If you work hard, you'll soon become an ace.
But... when you go back to school, you'll have to go back to Paris.
- But, grandpa... - It's sad to say, but nowadays, the future of youth lies within the cities.
It breaks my heart to say it because, as you know, I would love it if you could stay here with me.
I would love to stay here with you too. Don't be silly!
After a few months, you'd get bored.
No. I'm happy, here.
I'm happy like... - Like...
- Like with your mother?
So much the better.
You should join your grannie out in the fields.
Today, she's at Devil's Abyss.
You know where that is?
What will grannie say? You'll soon find out.
Don't forget to greet the folks you encounter.
Here people talk to each other.
"Parlez-moi d'amour
"Redites-moi des choses tendres
"Votre beau discours... "Mon coeur n'est pas las de l'entendre
Besides, you wanted to kill my parents!
You said my father was your friend and that my mother loved you!
But you fired a gun at them.
That's why you went to jail!
It's your aunt who told you that?
Let me tell you what happened.
I don't want to hear it.
Leave me alone!
What are you up to, Olivier?
You came directly?
No, I swear it, grannie.
- Did you meet anyone on the way? - No.
Actually, yes. I saw Louison Flandin.
He asked me to go to a soccer game with him.
- I told him I was coming to see you.
- Very well, then.
Good. Well, I'm off to see the cows.
What are you doing?
You can tell you're from Paris!
Cows don't care for sugar. They like salt!
Give the sugar to the dog.
It's not good for his eyes, but over here, we don't let anything go to waste.
Here, doggy, come boy.
Good, huh? That's good.
How can you tell when it's time to go back to the farm, then?
Look at the shadow cast by the shed.
When it reaches the boulder, it's time to bring the cows home.
Looks like you have a heat stroke. Go freshen up at the river.
- The river looks pretty deep.
- "Devil's Abyss"?
- A long time ago, there was a man who bragged about not believing in either God or Devil.
Well, the poor bastard got his punishment.
The river swallowed him.
- Really? - Obviously! He made a point to come and work here on the Lord's Day.
One stormy day, as he was driving his cart along the banks, he surely came too close to the precipice.
Climb up on the rock... and bend over the precipice.
You'll see the remains of the cart at the bottom!
- See it?
- Not sure.
The water isn't clear.
Look again!
Ah yes! I see it.
I see the cart with bones and a skeleton!
Did you notice, grannie?
The shadow has set on the boulder.
Well done, you're a fast learner.
Soon, you'll be able to lead the cows to the pasture all by yourself.
If you like. Here.
Take my stick and lead them toward the trail.
Go on! We'll see how well you do.
Come on cows! Let's go.
Where are you going, Poumérade?
It's pretty obvious you pealed chunks off her hoof.
I'm not selling her to you. (Speaking Patois)
Patois with a Parisian accent. Very comical.
He's making progress in this area too!
- Olivier! It's great that you can now smith, but you can't neglect your studies.
Wait!
We're not done yet.
An automobile!
She did well for herself, our Victoria.
That's for sure.
She went to Paris and Paris went to her head.
She's ashamed of us.
She avoids telling her friends that we are blacksmiths. Instead, she says we're ironwork artists.
I think being a blacksmith is a more noble trade.
You plan to stay with us?
No, no. I came in like the wind, just to drop off Julienne.
I thought you dropped in to say hi.
That too, of course.
My God; this heat! Tell me,
Marceau, my grandson.
How's he doing?
His condition is stable the doctors tell me.
But they may have to perform a thoraco.
- A thoracoplasty.
It's an operation consisting of compressing the diseased lung by removing some ribs.
- In his case, 6.
- That's terrible!
- Are you going back? - No.
He's asked us to leave.
One-eyed bitch!
I would give both my legs if it could bring him back to health.
Children should not have to suffer. And how is your leg doing?
A bit of pain, that's all.
The real burden is inaction. Lucky for me, I have Olivier.
- He seems well acclimatised. - Yes.
He's very happy, here.
But you must take him back to Paris.
Oh no.
That's out of the question!
Victoria!
I am your father. This is my home. I'm in charge.
And you'll listen to me, for God's sake!
I worked with him almost every day.
He's a very bright boy.
He's inquisitive, devours books.
With a bit of help, he'll become someone.
He must be allowed to further his studies.
You have no right to condemn him to ignorance.
Sometimes I wonder if perhaps I wasn't too hard on him.
Well, speak of the devil. - Good day, aunt.
- I am happy to see you again.
- Likewise, aunt.
Your grandfather tells me you like it here.
Yes, aunt.
You know what would make him happy?
- Going up to see Marceau.
- That won't happen.
It's true! Show her the letter.
Your aunt was clear: he doesn't want to see anyone.
He's was cruel toward me, this morning.
- I'm sure he'll want to see me.
- Listen,
Victoria, it would do Marceau a lot of good!
Well.
If you're ready in 5 minutes, I'll drop you off at the sanatorium.
There is an evening coach.
- Thank you, aunt. - Remember: 5 minutes! - I'll be ready.
- Hey!
Olivier, before you go, drink a bit of wine and chew on some garlic.
It will give you strength.
And repel evil.
Guillaume, please! Stop the car at the next curve.
Marceau is lost, Olivier.
The doctors will attempt an operation but gave me little hope.
You must not tell anyone. Do you understand?
- I swear, aunt. Ah!
My God.
It's not fair!
He suffers immensely.
You'll see, he's changed.
But he mustn't find out.
Anyway, who knows.
Perhaps there is still a chance.
I'm sure of it, my aunt.
I'm sure of it.
I don't have the courage.
He's inside that building.
Room 18. Second floor.
You'll have to sneak in, children are not allowed.
Don't worry.
Thank you, aunt.
I know you. You're his cousin.
You can't stay here. He's not in his room.
He's outside, in the solarium.
- Go on!
- Thanks.
- It's you, my little outcast.
I knew you would come.
- How did you get here? - Your mother brought me.
You see, the Divine isn't that bad.
Have a seat.
By the way, bravo for the stunt you pulled at the college.
Your letter cracked me up. A work of art!
How are you feeling?
I hope you didn't come for a medical report.
It boils down to one word: irrecoverable.
That's not true.
After your operation, things will improve.
That's right...
Hope that everything will go well after losing half your ribs!
I must admit, I'm a little pessimistic.
You see, Olivier.
I would have preferred dying in New York.
Or on the bridge of a transatlantic.
Much better than here, don't you think?
Olivier, I beg you.
You remember...?
The concert by Louis Armstrong?
We share so many memories you and I.
We do indeed!
Grandpa embraces you warmly.
Tell him I'm doing well.
How is he?
His leg still hurts.
You know, we almost succeeded to come see you.
- We were forced to turn back, though.
- Darn Escoulas, hasn't changed a bit.
Well, here comes my guardian angel.
As you can see, I have nothing to complain about.
I was rude with Julienne this morning.
I would like you to watch over her. Extend her the love I was incapable of giving her.
Okay? - Do you promise?
- I promise, Marceau.
Alright, time to go.
And please...
- Don't come back to see me.
- Why? - Please.
- You can't stay, Olivier.
I told you already.
Children are not allowed.
Don't be angry with him.
You'll see, you'll like it up here.
This is the best mattress ever.
So put your mind at rest.
Have you seen these old books?
"Le Tour de la France by two children".
- Of course it's good. With that I learned to read to my wife.
- May I open it?
Look at this beautiful medal.
It was your father's. With palms.
And what's this?
Belongs to my daughter.
- Aunt Victoria?
- Yes.
Long ago, with only an orange, you could celebrate Christmas Eve.
Oh yes! Back then, we didn't have the luxury of going... to the hospital in a carriage.
Life was really harsh... and money was hard to come by. We would fight over it.
Have you seen this funny boot?
All bloated and with an enormous sole.
That shoe belonged to your dad.
You see, we send boys to their death before they can experience life.
Your poor father.
When he came back to this country, after he was injured,
I didn't recognize him. All I could say was: "There you are".
He wept.
He walked between two crutches, still bore shrapnel in his skin,
his lungs burnt by the gas.
To think he was once as swift as a squirrel, only to stagger into a cloud.
He would raise his eyes, as if to prepare an answer, but he said nothing.
Your mother restored his taste for life.
Just enough time to make a little darling.
And now he's gone.
I can't sleep.
Marceau is always on my mind.
It is so unfair.
We were planning on getting married.
I would do anything for him to be cured.
Don't worry.
Soon, he'll be well again.
He told me that even if he was to recover, he would no longer marry me.
He said that only because he doesn't want to leave you with any regrets. - You think so?
- I'm sure.
This illness has really changed him.
Besides, there's this other girl, the nurse.
Don't cry, Julienne. Don't.
You know, he doesn't really care about Charlotte.
- I don't know.
I don't know anymore. - It's true!
He told me.
Don't worry.
Kiss me, Olivier.
Not like that, you idiot.
- Not really, no.
I think I'll go back to Paris.
I thought you were going to stay here a few days.
I'm too close to Marceau, here.
Victor?
Would you mind taking me to the station?
I'm really busy with work, you know. Olivier could take you.
He can steer a buggy.
You must not loiter on the way.
You will come home right after.
- You know, I can go by myself. - No.
A young girl should never travel alone.
He's right.
By the way, the other day in Langeac, I saw a used wireless.
- For a good price. - No music in my house!
Why not?
- A bit of music, here and there.
- No, no.
Novelties are bearers of misfortune.
It seems you like to dwell in it.
You don't want water springing from a pipe, so you carry a bucket.
You don't want music that could uplift our spirits.
You can't live in the past or among the dead forever, mother.
I can live with mine, thank you.
Line 24, arriving from Puy-en-Velay, en route to Paris via Clermont-Ferrand, Immediate departure, platform 1.
It was sweet of you to accompany me, Olivier.
We'll meet again in Paris, some day?
Victor was right, it's a pity you are leaving.
- We were happy together.
- You're a sweetie. - Marceau asked me to watch over you.
- And you've succeeded nicely.
Are you crazy, you little pervert!
- What's the matter? The other night... - Quiet!
Warm-blooded, just like your mother.
- You have no right to say that!
- Oh yeah?
How do you call a woman who had lovers?
None of your business.
She did as she pleased.
Victoria said your mother was a small-time goddess.
It's not her fault if Privat tried to shoot her.
Not her fault? Well there's a good one!
Why do you say that?
My poor Olivier!
If you only knew what your mother did to Privat.
What did she do to him?
- Tell me, Julienne! - I can't tell you.
Attention, now departing.
Go and see Privat.
He lives on a big estate called Les Bruyères.
He'll tell you what really happened.
We'll meet again.
Later.
Giddy-up!
Come on, faster!
Giddy-up!
Hue, Nono!
Easy, easy, Nono.
Whoa!
I'd like to speak to Mr. Privat.
It's very important. Yes, I see.
He shouldn't be long.
You can wait in the living room.
Follow me.
It's your mother, Olivier.
A friend of mine made that bust.
She was about to turn 18.
I thought you wouldn't want to see me again.
I didn't come for you.
I need to know something.
- It's very important.
- I'm listening.
Why did you want to kill my parents.
What did they do to you?
I was your... your mother's first husband. My mother's first husband?
Your mother couldn't bring herself to tell you she was divorced. She didn't want you troubled by that.
We got married before the war.
We were living together and then I was called to the front.
At the same time your father was.
We were childhood friends, all three of us.
When he got injured, in October of 1914, and was released from duty, your mother took care of him.
I thought they met when father came back wounded from the war? No. No.
But your mother was indeed his nurse.
Months and years went by.
Then one day, I received a disheartening letter... from your mother. She was leaving for Paris, with your father.
- It's not true.
You're lying! - No.
You'll be the only one to know the truth.
A truth I have never revealed. To anyone.
Upon reading the letter, I was shattered, forlorn.
I wanted to find your mother.
In the spring of 1917, during General Nivell's offensives,
I had volunteered to perform inspections on a fort we had retaken.
I picked up a grenade, unpinned it, then I pushed my arm through a gun slit,
and held it until my arm blew off.
That's how I became a war hero.
Weeks later, I left the hospital and headed for Paris.
With the intent of killing your parents, and turning the gun on myself. There it is.
Olivier!
- I hope you'll forgive me.
- My parents would never have done that!
It's not their fault, Olivier. It's the war that created this mess.
This can't be true.
I will never forgive them!
They're no longer my mother nor my father!
You have no right to judge them!
You'll understand this later on.
It is possible to love... and then no longer love.
We're not masters...
- Shut up!
Move on, Nono! Move on!
Giddy-up!
Giddy-up!
Olivier! Charlotte?
What's going on? It's Marceau?
Marceau?
No. Don't worry.
He's over there, in the car.
They wouldn't let him go out, but he persuaded the director. He wanted to see you.
They will operate tomorrow.
You'll see.
He's weakened, but keeps in good spirits.
So, my little outcast? - You're now a shepherd?
- You're crazy, Marceau.
You should be resting!
But I am resting, here.
Don't say anything to your grandpa?
Let him cherish the image of a young man in perfect health, rather than one of deterioration.
Besides, I came for you.
I got your letter.
I needed to talk to you..
- You didn't have to come. - I know that.
I wanted to ask you something.
You must forgive your parents, Olivier.
Do not judge them, as I often did with mine.
Since I've been living with death, I find these judgments so ludicrous.
Your parents loved each other and you want to hold that against them? No.
- But look at what they did to Mr. Privat!
- It's all the same.
The love they had for each other... and the wrong they did are 2 sides of the same medal.
You cannot split them apart.
Remember, Olivier.
One day, you said that my life and death wouldn't have meaning just for me.
So now, I want you to trust me.
It's the last time...
You're crazy, Marceau!
We'll see each other after the operation!
Do what I say.
Promised?
I know you're going back to school in Paris.
But before you go, I want you to visit your parents' grave.
And tell them that you love them.
How can I tell them?
If you put your heart into it, they'll hear you.
I have a book on the language of flowers.
I'll offer them a rose.
A red rose.
It's a symbol of love.
Crazy love.
You see, when you want to.
Now, now.
Don't start that again.
We'll see each other again!
We'll travel to America.
We'll go cheer Louis Armstrong at the Cotton Club.
We'll have a great time!
- What do you say, my Olive?
- Let's do it!
Courage, my little urchin!
You old fart!
I'm the editor of "L'Illustration."
I'm here for Odilon Hubert, the Algerian MP.
Mr. Hubert?
I'm Camille Bruyère.
As the first man to represent Frenchmen in Algeria, my newspaper would like to devote an article to you.
- About Algeria?
- No, about you.
About me?
A Shakespearean tragedy with blood and violence?
Our readers love that, sir.
Is that so?
It's another country, young man. Another world. A land of extremes.
Scalding days, freezing nights. The choking smell of goat and jasmine.
Let me take notes.
It's about other religions and peoples.
It's about Arabs, fanatical Muslim warriors who only love horses and arms.
That's great.
Let's give it a try and start at the beginning.
When did you get to Algeria?
I arrived in Oran in 1837 with my friend Hélie Toussaint.
I was a medical officer and he was an interpreter.
Algeria was a world filled with wild dreams.
Everyone had their own ideas about what to do with this newly conquered land.
We'd been fighting for 7 years.
L'Algérie des chimères A DREAM OF ALGERIA 1.
THE EMIR'S DOCTOR
He's the guy on the black stallion.
And I, Jean-Baptiste Frémond, will get Abd el-Kader!
The colonel wanted you to see the interior of Algeria.
You'll have your fill.
Wait for my signal to shoot.
I've been in the field for 3 years and I haven't killed a single Arab yet!
If you shoot, you'll get court martialed!
Crap!
The sly old dog!
Curse your mother's religion!
Let him die, Doc!
Take care of our wounded.
- He's a man like you and me.
- Maybe like you, not me.
You're naïve.
You won't live long if you keep this up.
Hey interpreter, ask this guy where they spent the night.
Who gave them food and shelter?
Tell him I'll shoot him in the head if he lies.
- Témouchent. - Shit!
- Let's go.
I'll show him what I'm made of.
Breteuil!
Dumas!
Savages!
Burn that damn village!
Set the whole town ablaze!
Cut down the trees!
Burn their crops!
Those brutes must die!
- Take them all!
- Even the women?
I said "them all," Lieutenant!
Women and children too! - Why the women?
- Arabs buy and sell women like cattle.
The ugly ones become slaves.
They invented razzias, Lieutenant, not us.
The only thing Arabs respect is strength.
That's the only thing those fanatics understand.
Strength.
Imagine our despair.
Hélie and I were Saint-Simonians.
We hadn't come to Algeria for this, but to unite the East and the West like we'd sworn to do a few months earlier in Paris.
You are now brothers through Saint-Simon. Apostles of a new Christianity.
We Saint-Simonians, who follow the teachings of our master, the late Count of Saint-Simon, a remarkable economist and philosopher, want to build a new society based on progress.
Engineers, polytechnicians and bankers, we'll spread our message around the world.
Let's leave for Africa, for the Regency of Algiers over which the French flag now flies.
We swear!
Hello, Ferdinand.
Mother, you know Ferdinand de Lesseps.
Mr. de Lesseps.
He's going to Egypt with Father Enfantin to build a canal linking the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.
A canal?
What ever for?
So India-bound boats won't need to go around Africa.
Those are the Pereire brothers, very rich bankers.
Mother, this is my friend Hélie Toussaint.
We're going to Algeria together.
He's an interpreter and I'll act as medical officer in Oran.
We'll build a new world over there, Madam.
All men will be equal, regardless of race or religion.
On the Barbary Coast! My God!
Have a seat, Mother.
- I don't know that friend. - He's a new one.
Allow me to congratulate you, Mrs. Hubert.
Your son Odilon is a good boy and a zealous apostle of our Saint-Simonian cause.
- I fear for him, sir.
You're sending him to Algeria, a war- and cholera-ridden land.
But it's an exciting mission:
To wake up slumbering Islam and create a new society.
My only son with Arabs!
- We're to meet the colonel.
- He's busy at the moment.
- We'll wait here.
Did you know Colonel Lamoricière was Saint-Simonian too?
He went to the Polytechnique, so he must be in favor of progress.
- Goodbye, Mr. Bensimon. - Goodbye.
Interpreter Hélie Toussaint.
Medical officer, Major Odilon Hubert.
Father Enfantin told me about your coming to Algeria.
Welcome to this beautiful country where much remains to be done.
Follow me.
I'll brief you.
We're occupying the ports of Algiers, Bône and Oran.
Our only intention, at first, was to occupy the coastline, like the Turks.
That isn't what we saw when we arrived, Colonel.
This is clearly a war to conquer and exterminate the Arabs.
Some Parisian newspapers wrote that we're more barbarian than the barbarians.
They're unfortunately right.
But whose fault is it?
Abd el-Kader has started a holy war against us.
He swore to throw us into the sea.
He's waged a vast, cruel and ruthless war against us.
We did invade his land.
We're dealing with religions fanatics! We have to dominate them, or they'll drive us out and the British will take our place.
The French government doesn't know what it wants.
Ten governor-generals in 6 years!
We don't have enough men to end this once and for all.
Barely 30,000 men vs. 3 million Arabs in a country 3 times the size of France.
It's ridiculous!
Yet, the Saint-Simonian mission is clear:
Excuse me, Colonel...
How is that different from colonization?
The land, Toussaint.
The land.
We need to leave it to the Arabs who are its rightful farmers.
Our role is to build factories, roads and railroads.
I would like to volunteer in such a regiment.
I have more important work for you.
Bugeaud will be in Oran next week. His mission is to seek peace with Abd el-Kader.
You speak Arabic, Toussaint?
I can pass for Egyptian.
You'll remain incognito in the native city.
There, you'll contact Abd el-Kader's man.
You want me to spy on the Arabs?
No, we're doing it for peace, for a good cause.
As for you, Hubert, you'll handle the cholera epidemic, which has hit our troops very hard.
- And the population even harder.
- I know. Hubert will treat everyone equally.
Be careful, Doctor.
The other doctors before you all died of cholera.
- What about you, Sister?
- God is watching over me.
Leila?
This is Leila, one of our orphans.
- She speaks Arabic and French.
- Hello, Miss.
Hello, Doctor.
He's dehydrated.
Tell him to drink a lot. Boiled water.
No need to be so formal with me.
I can teach you Arabic.
He needs a new bandage.
I will be chaperoning your lessons with Leila.
Why, Sister?
Don't you trust me?
I need to learn Arabic too.
Your convent's been here over 200 years - and you don't speak Arabic?
- I need the theory.
Cover him up.
He's in a sorry state.
I'm discouraged, Doctor. They keep dying.
I pray every day, but...
Medicine is making progress.
We now know it spreads through water.
Try turpentine.
Your protégé is great!
When the poor girl was little, Arabs killed her parents before her eyes.
Her family's from Spain.
But she looks and speaks Arabic.
Her grandmother was a "mamma Rosa."
A long time ago, a boat with 10 of our Spanish sisters ran aground here.
Our sisters were all sold as slaves to Kabyle and Turkish chiefs.
The mother superior was named Maria Rosa, so the offspring of those forced marriages were named "mamma Rosas."
You shouldn't laugh.
- Forgive me, Sister.
- We raised Leila as one of our own.
Tell him children have to drink a lot.
- He said, "May Allah bless you."
- Get a stretcher.
Want a woman?
You had that one yesterday.
She's no longer a virgin.
Let me in. Let me in!
- What're you doing here?
- You'll blow my cover.
Everyone knows who you are.
I came to see for myself that you're hiding in brothels and have forgotten your mission.
The colonel told me to blend in, so I am.
You've no idea what delights the East has to offer.
Everything is here to please men.
These women have been raised to fulfill our every desire.
Odilon, I'm uniting with the East on a daily basis.
- Want to try?
- Have you lost your mind?
You'll come around.
This isn't quite the spiritual union our Saint-Simonian brothers had in mind.
The colonel sent me.
He hasn't heard from you in over a month.
You risk getting court martialed.
I found a way to contact Abd el-Kader.
Special tricks, huh?
So do I.
Why are you spying on us?
I'm not spying.
I'm bringing peace.
We also seek peace.
But peace is worth nothing without freedom.
France is willing to respect your freedom. - If you stop the war. - It's not up to me.
- Tell your leader.
- Only Allah has the power - to decide
Allah has a lot of responsibilities.
- I'm sure he could use our help.
- I'll do my best.
- Tell me about Bahia.
- She's beautiful.
- I know.
I saw her.
- She's nice.
- Haven't you had enough women?
- She's different.
I'm Bahia.
My father, Si Kaddour, sent me to tell you Emir Abd el-Kader, the leader of the holy war, is ready to broker peace.
You've brought me great news.
You speak French well.
My father didn't have a son, so he taught me to read and write like a boy.
That means "I love you."
- Excuse me?
- Right.
- It could be useful.
But more sensuous.
Yes, again.
I have great news!
- Any new developments?
- I'm in love.
Crazy in love!
It's not what you think, Odilon.
She's from a big tent. - Excuse me?
- From a noble family.
She's beautiful, smart...
- Who is she?
- Si Kaddour's daughter.
- Bahia?
We studied together.
That's fantastic, Leila!
You can help me.
Go tell her I love her and want to marry her.
- You want to marry an...
- An Arab.
I won't be the first.
The wife of the general in Constantine is Arab.
No, she's Kabyle.
Leila...
You know her, so go see her and tell her I love her.
Please. I beg you! Do it for me.
Arranging marriages is for old women.
She's your friend, she'll listen to you.
Fine, I'll play matchmaker.
Just for you!
- And your mission?
- That's the other good news.
Abd el-Kader is ready to negotiate.
I notified Lamoricière, who informed Bugeaud.
- There's going to be a truce.
- You don't know Arabs.
It's a ruse. They'll keep fighting.
You're one to talk, Leila.
Aren't you Arab?
Not at all. I'm Kabyle.
I'm not Muslim, but Christian.
Anyway... religion is all that matters here.
It's more important than blood, more important than anything!
You think he really loves me?
He's been with so many women.
Do you love him? I don't know.
My father wants to give me to a friend of his.
He may be the love of your life.
All I know is I want to be his wife - and bear his children.
- Sounds like love.
You know it's up to the men.
My father won't let me marry an infidel.
That can be arranged.
He adores you.
I don't even know if Odilon loves me.
I had to kiss him.
Go see old Zara for a love potion.
We already have one: this, - this and this.
- Leila, you sound like a whore. That's what we are!
Fathers sell us like sheep.
Women serve men and bear their children.
I'll choose my own husband.
- I've already chosen.
- You love him?
I want him. I'll get him.
She'll marry you on one condition.
- Anything!
- She can only marry a Muslim.
- That doesn't bode well.
- There's a way:
Become Muslim.
Go see the Imam, say, "Allah is great, "Muhammad is his prophet" and it's done!
I've already thought about it.
Islam is a good religion.
No priests, no bishops, no pope.
Just you and God.
Anyway, it's the same God for everyone.
Yes, but... circumcision?
Circumcision.
The barber will give your willy a clean cut.
Plus, he uses an English shaver.
Sure you want to get circumcised?
I have to to become Muslim.
Let me do it instead of that butcher.
He's not a butcher, he's a barber.
That's worse.
You don't know the words that need to be said.
I'm giving a part of myself to God.
Want me to go with you?
Hélie!
I envied him in a way.
He threw himself into everything, while I, the good Jesuit student, weighed the pros and cons for so long, I'd never decide.
Should I marry Leila?
She was beautiful and bewitching, but she scared me like this country did.
Done.
- We're brothers now.
- Go!
The brute had to do it 3 times!
Told you so.
I'll bandage you at the hospital.
I'm Muslim like you, Si Kaddour.
You gave me your word.
"I'll give you my daughter if you become Muslim."
Will you give her to me now?
I gave you my word, so I will. As long as the uncles agree.
What's it to them?
They're the elders, wise men.
They decide for the family.
It's tradition.
Are you circumcised?
What I wouldn't do for you, Bahia...
So, are you done inspecting me?
They agree.
I'm grateful.
You can have Bahia, but there's the dowry.
The dowry.
- 1,000 francs.
- Alright.
And 50 sheep.
Fifty sheep?
Where would I find those?
Buy them.
From whom?
Me.
- Congratulations! - Thanks.
Bugeaud signed a peace treaty with Abd el-Kader.
The Treaty of Tafna recognizes his authority over 2/3 of Algeria.
The emir set up his camp on the Tagdempt plateau, between Mascara and the Ouarsenis mountains.
I'm worried, Hubert.
Why, Colonel?
You wanted everyone to stay where they belonged.
I hear he's a loyal fellow.
He can't stand our presence on Muslim ground.
It's a question of religion, which is sacred.
Don't forget, Hubert, that the emir is a prophet as well as a military man and a poet.
Only Islam is capable of producing such men.
We sent him a delegation.
He requested a doctor to treat his sick mother.
I appointed you.
Go to him. Try to get in his good graces and keep me apprised each week.
You can count on me, Colonel.
Enjoy your dinner, last night?
Yes, Colonel.
On behalf of my master, Emir Abd el-Kader, prince of the faithful, defender of the Prophet's religion, welcome.
On behalf of France and science, I came to help the emir and his family.
Our emir is sad.
His mother, the holy and revered Zohra, is seriously ill.
If you cure her, he'll shower you with gifts.
I don't need gifts.
Your master's gratitude will be ample reward.
- She's burning up!
- It often happens to her.
It's malaria.
- Then it's up to God.
- There's a new medication:
quinine.
I prepared a potion with Quina bark.
Careful. It's quite bitter.
She must take a sip every 2 hours.
I'll be back tomorrow.
This is your house.
Just ask if you need anything.
The emir will see you tomorrow morning.
I'll come get you.
Go see the French doc. You'll do his cooking and cleaning.
The doctor is a spy.
Watch his every move.
Bring me anything that he writes.
What will you give me for that?
Like she said, your uncle wants me for his harem.
Your uncle's rich.
I'll find you a husband.
Young or old, but rich.
You're pretty, you'll get your pick.
Who are these prisoners?
The leaders of a rebel tribe.
The Ben Zetoun.
Welcome to my home.
I'm happy that French science could serve the mother of the prince of the faithful.
It's a good example of what we can bring your country.
Medicine was invented by an Arab.
I plan on setting up a university.
Our doctors will be as good as French ones.
Why waste time when France offered you to skip centuries and enter the modern world.
A new world could come out of the union of the East and the West.
Arabs weren't made to sow wheat and build cities.
- We're nomads, sons of the wind.
- Nothing solid is built on wind.
Nothing solid is built without God.
God is with me. I only listen to Him.
He forbids me from letting any Muslim live - under Christian domination.
- We don't want to dominate you, but to bring you the benefits of civilization and progress.
When God wants to hurt an ant, He gives it wings.
Full of pride and joy, it takes to the sky.
Then a little bird sees it and swallows it.
We'll be friends if everyone stays where they belong.
We value freedom! Only a holy war can bring freedom and independence.
A holy war never required anyone butchering their enemy, like I saw at Aïn Témouchent.
We've made peace.
Come see me whenever you please.
You'll be welcome wherever I am.
This is from the emir.
Refusing a gift is a grave insult.
- A servant for you.
- Where's my servant Ahmed?
- He asked to join the army of the faithful.
Naouel's a better cook.
Naouel.
You speak French?
Kabylia.
My father worked for a French lieutenant at the Arab office.
The emir's soldiers came to our village.
They killed the lieutenant,...
Don't worry, I'll treat you well.
You're my father and mother to me.
Where will you sleep?
- There's no bed.
I sleep on the floor.
Call me if you need anything.
Let me guess...
So, the coffee's Turkish, the milk is from a goat, but the bread is mine.
Happy?
- Don't kiss me like that.
- You're my master, I'm yours.
This is:
Naouel was the mistress-servant every man secretly dreams of.
I dove head first into the bewitching world of Islam, which mixed nobility, poetry and cruelty, and where God commanded every move.
I was far from everything, elsewhere. I never though it would end and that it was simply a phase in my life.
The emir had just come back from a long expedition in the Sahara.
You were right, Colonel.
He's been taking advantage, these last 2 years, of the false peace to rule over the other tribes.
He's plundered the Kabylia, the Ouarsenis, the Titteri and now the Sahara.
Will he ever unite these dispersed tribes?
If he does, it'll be in spite of us.
The women at the souk are saying the war with the French is about to start again.
If there's a war, you'll leave without me.
I'll take you with me.
There's a rumor that hostilities will resume against the French.
The emir now has a regular army of 8,000 infantry,
2,000 cavalry, 20 field guns, and 240 gunners.
Add to that, 60,000 irregulars armed with French rifles they got off our dead or from their prisoners, and English guns the British consul sold them.
Odilon?
Hélie?
- I'm so happy to see you!
- So am I. How are you?
Well.
- Three stripes!
- Same to you.
Haven't you heard? You've been promoted.
This is such a remote place.
- Hey! She's stealing a letter!
- No, it's Naouel.
She brings my letters to the legation.
Your servant?
- You trust her?
- Of course. Well, she's more than my servant.
She's my girlfriend.
- Are you kidding me?
Good thing I'm here.
You're so naïve, Odilon.
She's here to spy on you.
That's what the Arabs do!
Can we talk about something else?
What brings you here?
I'm here with the major.
We came to see Abd el-Kader to prevent a new outbreak.
Our generals have captured Constantine.
To join Algiers and Constantine, they occupied a territory Abd el-Kader thinks is his.
Is he right?
We're obviously being dishonest.
So are the Arabs.
Abd el-Kader keeps saying that God willing, he'll throw the French into the sea.
After all, this is his land not ours.
If we leave, Algeria will go back to chaos.
What about the union of the East and the West?
We need peace first.
And freedom and equality for Arabs. Not a forced union.
Winning is all our generals want.
They want to subdue the natives.
Believe me, you should head back to Oran.
- Leila is waiting for you.
- How's Bahia?
I forgot to tell you. I have a son.
- Really?
- Ishmael.
He's almost a year old.
I hope you'll attend his circumcision.
I wouldn't miss it.
The French didn't keep their word.
The duke of Orléans and Marshal Valée crossed the Iron Gates and violated my territory.
It's an affront to our dignity.
I wrote to Louis-Philippe, the king of France.
He didn't even reply.
My men are in favor of a holy war.
The hissing of bullets is worth more than freshwater.
That would be a mistake.
France is stronger.
It has soldiers, canons, ships.
I am not scared.
Allah is with me.
My friends and I want freedom and equality for every Algerian and French person.
Perhaps, but it's your generals who lay down the law.
Winning is like saltwater, the more you drink,
- the thirstier you get.
- No matter who wins, a lot of men will fall under enemy fire.
It's fate, not bullets, that kill.
Muslims are ready to die for their faith.
The Koran says, "Heaven lies in the shade of swords."
I chose the honorable path: war.
Warn your people, so they can't say they weren't given fair warning.
Hadj Hamou will take you to the French outpost.
May Allah watch over you and your family.
I'll never forget you saved my mother.
May Allah guide you towards fair and honorable peace.
Naouel?
- Where's Naouel?
- She's gone.
- Where?
- Back to the harem.
She's leaving with me.
You can't expect a Muslim to follow an infidel.
- I want to see her.
- She doesn't want to see you.
You're lying!
She wants to leave with me.
You're naïve, Lieutenant Hubert.
I sent her here to spy on you.
She showed me all your letters.
"8,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 20 field guns."
You're well informed.
Get over it.
You're a soldier.
You should know that a man who trusts a woman isn't a real man.
Fight me!
You're the emir's guest.
He ordered me to see to your safety.
Hospitality is sacred to Muslims.
You're my guest.
I have to protect you.
- I owe you my life.
- I'll kill you next time.
...with sugar, milk, dates and raisins is a delight!
- Leila will be eating with us.
- I see, it's a conspiracy.
You should make up your mind.
She's perfect for you.
- Don't you like her?
- Of course I do.
So marry her!
Don't be like every single officer here who shacks up with a broad, but won't be seen in public with her.
Sorry, I... You're right.
It's all in the past.
- Let's talk shop.
Excuse me, I must take care of Ishmael.
I'll join you.
Leila, I wanted to tell you...
Firstly... I have something to confess.
The Kabyle girl?
Hélie told me.
He should mind his own business.
It's different between us, isn't it?
So you'd be willing to...
Our best wishes to the newlyweds.
Their union is celebrated under favorable auspices.
Our troops just crushed the regular army of Abd el-Kader, who wanted to challenge us to a battle.
But in vain.
His troops were annihilated, thanks to my friend, Colonel Yusuf.
Ladies and gentlemen, to love and victory!
You're very optimistic, General.
Abd el-Kader has lost the battle but not the war.
He started a guerilla war and is stirring up the tribes.
Here and there, perhaps.
But trust me, he lost face and therefore the game.
It's only a question of time now.
Bugeaud was named governor-general.
He's bringing 100,000 men.
We'll be able to pull out all the stops.
Things are clear to Paris.
Algeria is and must remain a French province.
We'll turn it into a modern country.
What are they doing?
- How do you like it?
- It's sublime.
- Want something to drink? - Two granitas.
- Two granitas, please.
- Where did you get that?
- In a Jewish store.
- It suits you.
I prefer North African dresses. They're more mysterious.
Eroticism relies on mystery.
Is it true that Abd el-Kader is 20 km from Algiers?
He was. He raided the Mitidja and vanished without a trace.
We haven't seen the last of him.
This morning, we met the royal committee for the development of Algeria.
There'll be a railroad from Algiers to Blida.
The mineralogical map says we have coal...
We're late, Odilon.
We're expected at noon.
Your kepi.
- Wait for us for lunch. - Yes.
Good day to you, Sir.
Colonization is at a standstill.
What's the use of conquering land if no one settles there?
No one wants to settle on a foreign land that hasn't been completely pacified.
It will be, Lamoricière, it will be!
I swear we'll take out the trash by any means necessary!
But I won't do it for Swiss or Austrian settlers! Those ignorant drunks!
You're right, General.
To make the most out of these huge areas the nomadic Arabs have neglected, we need big capitalist companies who possess great means.
We recommend it, as the modern and effective way.
Fiddlesticks!
That's typical of your Saint-Simonian friends.
A bunch of dreamers and visionaries!
You see, Lamoricière, I haven't been to the Polytechnique, unlike yourself.
I'm a soldier and a farmer.
I learned everything on my Limousin farm.
The Mitidja isn't the Beauce.
May I respectfully point out, General, that the Limousin isn't the Mitidja either.
Believe it or not, Captain Toussaint, I had noticed that.
"Ense et aratro." It's my motto.
With the sword and plow.
Like Cincinnatus, the Roman farmer-soldier. Veterans can settle here after their service is done:
plow, horse, rifle.
I'll even give them wives.
Natives?
My chief of staff, who's retired, is now the mayor of Toulon.
He can get me servants, widows, single women... You catch my drift.
Germaine, do you take Gustave to be your husband, to be faithful unto him and be part of the Church?
- Gustave, do you take Germaine to be your wife, to be faithful unto her and be part of the Church?
- You are now joined in holy matrimony.
Here are your rings.
Poor girl.
- I hear she's an orphan.
- Who knows, she might be happy.
Fat chance!
It's the luck of the draw.
- Germain, do you take...
- Know what they're doing?
They've giving land to young soldiers who've completed 5 of their 7 years of service.
- So?
- So they won't leave.
They'll have to spend at least 2 more years here.
Here is your title of ownership, a plow and a horse to go with it, and a rifle to defend yourself against those bastards.
Madam, here is the key to your house.
Live happily and prosper.
- Thank you, General.
- Madam, here is the key - to your house. - Thank you.
Friends! After having conquered this land in the name of France, you will now farm it and make it your new home for you and your children.
I wish you all the best.
Drum roll.
We're stealing the Arabs' land, General.
No need to exaggerate.
They weren't using it.
But small-scale farming won't turn Algeria into Beauce.
If Abd el-Kader lets us.
The governor chose to send 3 units after him.
I'm to command one.
With all due respect, I'm not sure I'd like to join the hunt.
You don't have a choice, Toussaint.
I've just received word you'll be serving under the young duke of Aumale who'll command Yusuf's unit.
You'll be his interpreter and Hubert, his medical officer.
The king's son!
That's rather flattering.
I regret losing you, but it'll be good for your careers.
Colonel Yusuf spotted the smalah.
It eluded us twice in 4 days, but we have it now.
It's here! By the Taguine well. The troops, the women and children.
How on earth can they move camp that quickly?
I don't know, My Lord.
Is Abd el-Kader with them?
I didn't want to sound the alarm by getting too close.
- When Abd el-Kader isn't there, he leaves 500 men.
We have enough cavalrymen.
Let's go.
We should wait for the infantry. They're 3 hours away.
Sound the charge, Lieutenant.
My Lord, the duke of Aumale told me to inform you that he captured Abd el-Kader's smalah at noon on May 16.
We left with the cavalry at dawn and encountered them at noon.
I'll never forget this extraordinaire event.
Get to the point, my friend.
The African chasseurs went around the smalah to take it from the rear while Colonel Yusuf launched a frontal attack.
Chaos and panic ensued. There was a stampede.
Very well indeed.
What about Abd el-Kader?
He wasn't there, General.
General! We captured 300 notables and warlords, their families, horses and sheep, and Abd el-Kader's war chest:
a wonderful booty.
It almost cost the duke of Aumale his life.
Coming, Hubert?
- All hope is lost, My Lord.
Guard!
Move away!
Let the women and child go and I'll surrender!
You saved my life, Captain.
Is there anything you want?
Give me the 3 prisoners.
She's waiting for you outside.
- Why did you abandon me, Odilon?
- Abandon you?
You spied on me and betrayed me.
You believed him?
Hadj Hamou kidnapped me and put me in his harem.
And the letters?
He only managed to get one from me.
I'm here, Odilon, to tell you
I never betrayed you.
But you doubted me.
You didn't love me enough.
Is that your son?
Ours.
Aïssa.
No one must ever know, otherwise Hadj Hamou will kill my son and I.
He put me in his harem.
He never asked me anything.
Hadj Hamou is a good man,
He's a good husband and father.
Aïssa and I are his.
I simply wanted you to know.
Hélie told me you're married.
I had misjudged her.
- She's a good person.
Your worlds are too different.
- You're one to talk.
- It's not the same for me.
You think a man can love several women at once?
Muslims can have up to 4 women.
But there's always a favorite.
Some must sometimes love 2 women equally.
You wanted to kill me and almost did.
- It wasn't God's will.
- I know I owe you my life. So you're free to go.
- I'll take up arms again.
- That's your right.
- I'm indebted to you.
- No, we're even now.
Set Naouel and the child free.
We're now bound for life, you and I.
It is our destiny.
I thought the battle of the smalah would end the war, but Abd el-Kader would be on the run for another 4 years.
For 4 years, Hélie and I witnessed Yusuf and Lamoricière's hellish razzias which were answered by piles of severed French heads.
The emir fled to Morocco, where he was followed by Bugeaud who won the Battle of Isly.
The following year, Abd el-Kader butchered a French battalion at Sidi-Brahim.
On Christmas Eve 1847, after having resisted one of the most powerful countries on Earth for 15 years, the emir admitted defeat.
It was God's will.
Budge call!
Accept this horse as submission.
It's the last one I'll ride.
I will now go on foot.
I accept your homage to France, which grants you its protection, as a sign that the past has been forgiven.
You cured my holy mother.
May God watch over you and yours.
Had I had men like yours, I'd now be in Algiers.
Since you defeated me, you're the only person I can entrust with the weapons I used in the last 15 years of fighting you.
I will not be needing them anymore.
I will devote the rest of my life to God.
Past enemies can turn into future friends if they keep a pure heart.
You may see me as alive, but I am dead.
Squadron leader Hubert, on behalf of His Majesty Louis-Philippe, I appoint you Knight of the Legion of Honor.
Congratulations, Hubert, and thank you again.
Squadron leader Toussaint, on behalf of His Majesty, I appoint you Knight of the Legion of Honor.
End of the proclamation!
- Congratulations, dear friends.
You deserve it.
A lot remains to be done in this great country.
We'll build it instead of destroy it.
You know there's fighting in Paris right now.
There's talk of a second republic.
So we'll finally see that republic.
- What will happen to Algeria?
- A republic means liberty, equality and fraternity for every man.
Magenta Baribeau Épilogue
Welcome to Algeria, where much remains to be done.
The Saint-Simonians' mission is clear:
We want to protect the Arabs' language and religion.
I came to help the emir's family with French knowledge.
May Allah protect them.
I came to see for myself that you're hiding in brothels and have forgotten your mission.
I found a way to contact Adbelkader.
Violence is the only thing Arabs respect.
These savages must die!
This is a genocide, not a war.
Some Parisian newspapers even wrote that we're the barbarians.
A toast to his lovely wife.
You think a man can love several women simultaneously?
There's always a favorite.
I never betrayed you.
No one must ever know, otherwise Hadj Hamou will kill my son and I.
- He's your son?
- Ours.
You're the only person I can entrust with the weapons I used to fight you these last 15 years.
Algeria is and must remain a French province.
L'Algérie des chimères A DREAM OF ALGERIA 2.
DEATH'S FIANCÉE
Jérémy?
Émile and Jeanne must do the homework that I spent last night preparing.
Had we stayed in Oran, instead of moving to this godforsaken place, our children could go to school and get a normal education.
As soon as we have the money, we'll send them to the Algiers boarding school.
Did you know that the boy with typhoid died?
I did all I could.
I hope they won't catch it.
They played with him.
Is there any milk, Djamila?
Not that one.
I don't like goat milk.
It's sour.
There aren't any cows here, sweetie.
We wouldn't be here if your father hadn't left the army.
Where is he going, Mother?
I hadn't left the army, I had been kicked out for being republican and pro-Arab.
I was a republican.
The '48 revolution hit Paris, then Oran.
I believed in the new republic. And I still do. And I'm most certainly pro-Arab.
The Europeans mixed up revolution and beatings.
I paid the price after Napoleon III's December '51 coup.
Don't stay there. You have plenty of room.
Spread it out!
Leila wanted us to leave for France.
But leaving Algeria was out of the question.
So I rented this farm from a settler from Ariège who became disheartened and left with a bad fever.
"These dates are excellent."
"The umbrella is... "a nice shade "of red."
- What's wrong, Jeanne?
- My stomach hurts.
You don't have a fever.
Yaouled wrote "umprella."
- With a p!
- Stop teasing Yaouled.
I'd like to see you write Arabic!
He can't write Arabic either!
Don't listen to him. You've made tremendous progress.
- He made 15 mistakes yesterday.
- You made 12!
Why isn't Ishem here?
She's a girl.
Her father won't allow it.
- She might get ideas.
Alright. Let's continue.
The camel has big teeth.
Yaouled, make sure your sheep don't eat my wife's flowers.
Why are you calling me Yaouled?
I'm Ahmed.
You're Oran's Yaouled to me.
Go get the others, Ahmed, I've got a surprise.
Try them on. You'll be able to work faster.
Against thorns and rocks.
Your week's pay.
Kader. Cherif.
A gift.
Clean the stables and the horses' bedding like I showed you.
Boss! Mr. Charmasson is coming.
The Delorme farm was attacked this morning.
You're a doc, - there might be some wounded.
- Go get my kit.
Antoine?
Marie?
Savages! Madmen!
There's nothing we can do here.
Go get help at the village. We'll give them a nice burial.
Madmen!
What's the army waiting for?
You know they hate settlers.
They're savages!
The only solution is to eradicate them, like the Americans did with the Indians.
This is their land.
They were wasting it.
Don't make excuses for them!
I'm not!
I'm only trying to understand.
There's nothing to understand, Hubert!
Their own brothers...
Why? Why!
"Hadjouts" kill infidels and traitors
- so they can go to Heaven. - Bullshit!
That's what the marabout said.
It's holy war, "jihad."
The man who kills goes to Heaven.
Why are they wearing their shoes around their necks?
Their feet hurt.
They prefer going barefoot.
- But they cost me a fortune!
- Good.
They won't get used.
The workers want to invite you and your wife to thank you.
There's way too much.
We can't eat all this.
Politeness dictates you have to eat a lot.
Then you burp and say that you're full.
He'll be pleased.
They probably spent all the money
- you gave them this morning.
- They're generous and behaving like lords.
He has trachoma.
He can come to the farm whenever he wants.
It's because of Marie. - It's a race.
- They should close the valve.
That's right, blame Allah.
- You're not married?
- I'm not rich enough.
Wash his eyes everyday or he'll become blind.
Always wash children's hands and faces.
- We don't have much water.
- Come get some at the farm.
Are you due soon?
Jeanne is crying.
Typhoid fever!
I knew it.
She'll die!
- Calm down.
We'll treat her.
- Stop it! I'm a nurse!
Everyone around is dying of cholera, typhoid and dysentery!
You're exaggerating.
428 people died at the "funduq" last year.
And 94 in Boufarik.
The Mitidja is a rotten swamp!
The Arabs were right calling it "death's fiancée."
If the mosquitoes don't get us, Hadjouts will slit our throats
- and we'll all die! - Enough!
You're exhausted.
I'll take care of Jeanne.
Yes, I'm exhausted.
I want to leave.
I'll leave with the kids if you want to stay.
How will you get by?
I'll find work as a nurse or as a maid.
The children will go to school.
I want to leave.
Then leave!
I can't stand your constant whining!
Come with us. I beg you!
I belong here.
- Hurry, Mother!
I'll go see the chief physician at the Mustafa Hospital.
He agreed to hire me.
- I hope you'll enjoy yourself.
Algiers is full of thieves and adventurers.
Will you come visit?
I'll visit the children. Time permitting.
Take them to Blida.
The army has set up convoys to Algiers.
Goodbye, sweetie.
Goodbye, Émile.
- Bye, Djamila.
- We never should have come here.
Gee up!
I've had enough of Paris.
It's so gray and expensive here.
I don't have any friends.
Why don't we go home to Algiers?
I hear Leila and her children are there.
- What about Odilon?
- He stayed on the farm.
I don't get him.
We always said:
The land is for the Arabs, commerce, industry and mines for the French.
You're not listening to me.
I don't feel at home here.
The children are teased at school because they're Muslim and the salesgirls don't respect me.
I'm fighting for you, the children and the Algerians, so people will respect your religion, values and the color of your skin.
Algeria's fate is being decided here in Paris.
We've been here for years and no one listened to you.
The republic no longer exists. The republic no longer exists.
This is an empire, but nothing has changed.
Remember Fleury?
- The young lieutenant?
- He's a general now,
His Majesty's closest advisor.
I sent him my pamphlets and my book.
He read them to the emperor.
It'll happen, you'll see.
Then we'll go home? I promise.
We'll go home to Algeria.
I love you, Bahia.
So it doesn't matter where we are.
My dear Toussaint, we have good news for you.
They're about to start building the Algiers-Blida railroad.
Our friend Fournel is surveying Algeria's mineral resources. - He sent his report.
- Quite promising.
- We plan to invest.
- Large sums.
Thank you, sirs.
With your help, Algeria will become
- a modern country.
- Apologies for my tardiness.
We're making headway. The emperor freed Adbelkader and authorized him to leave France for Turkey.
As the Duke of Aumale and General Lamoricière had promised him when he surrendered over 5 years ago.
Despite this promise, France kept him prisoner - all these years. - I know, I know.
That was during King Louis-Philippe's reign.
The emperor made amends.
He brought Adbelkader to Longchamp races, the opera, awarded him the Legion of Honor.
We're now best friends.
Won't his liberation fuel Algeria's holy war?
He promised never to take up arms against France.
The only way to ensure peace in Algeria is to make it an independent colony where all Algerians would be equal citizens.
The emperor is in favor of that.
He spent most of his exile in England and admires
- British institutions.
- So what's he waiting for? It's time to give that territory its own statute.
He has other worries:
Russia, Italy...
Didn't we declare in 1839 and again in 1848 that Algeria was and would remain a French province?
Isn't this matter already closed?
I hope not.
Wanting Arabs to abide by French rules would be a mistake.
They have different customs and values and another religion.
Grab a plate. Eat with me.
No, it's pork.
- I can't eat it.
- There must be some chicken too.
Straight! You want a straight line!
Get out of here!
I said leave!
There you are.
Can you tell that idiot to leave my land?
These darn nomads don't respect private property.
Of course.
They don't know what that is.
What he say?
That it's communal land that belongs to everyone.
Are you kidding?
He knows I bought it from the government.
Scram!
Look at that strange set-up.
It's a great concept.
The camel is strong, but doesn't walk straight.
The donkey does.
- It's quite ingenious.
- I see you're still pro-Arab. They're bad neighbors.
So you sent your wife and kids to Algiers?
- She wanted to leave.
- Can't blame her.
This is a hard place for women and children.
Come see me tomorrow.
I'll be planting a liberty tree.
We can have a drink.
It'll take your mind off things.
Friends, this liberty tree is just like those we planted in France during the '48 revolution, a symbol of our faith in the republic.
Napoleon III desecrated the second republic and deported 12,000 of us to these wild African lands.
Because Guérin stood on the highest barricade at the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.
Because Roucariès refused to use his journalistic talents to serve the usurper.
And you, Ludovic, because the townspeople had elected you republican mayor!
They wanted to break us, but we and our Spanish friends will show them what 12,000 free men working on this Algerian land are capable of!
Let's turn this rotten Mitidja into a garden that we can one day transform into a new republic.
I propose the creation of a settlers association and a newspaper, "The Settler's Voice,"
that Roucariès will manage.
Long live the republic!
Music!
Don't forget republican principles mean liberty, equality and fraternity for everyone, including Arabs.
You must be kidding, Hubert.
These savages cut our compatriots' throats!
You want to turn them into Frenchmen?
You abolished slavery in '48.
Be coherent.
Arabs are men like you and I. We're all brothers.
What a sermon!
Leave that to the Arab representatives.
Beni Sassen's kaid is throwing a party next week.
Captain Audran invited us.
Come with, you'll see.
You're going?
It's Id al-Adha, an important Muslim holiday. We sacrifice sheep to commemorate Abraham's sacrifice.
Wasn't Abraham Jewish?
Judaism, Christianity and Islam are sister religions,
Talking about sheep...
You know it's the nomads' main source of income.
They say they don't have enough grazing fields.
Audran, I see what you're getting at.
Their sheep grazing on our land is a real problem.
They trample our seedlings and eat our wheat.
One flock of sheep grazed on your land.
We paid the fine.
They're nomads. They can go elsewhere.
Each tribe follows its own route.
Setting foot on another tribe's land could start a war.
That's their problem.
You're not making my job any easier.
What work?
We're the workers here, not you or them.
You wouldn't be here without the army!
That's an entrance!
Yes, they know how to fight!
You said it.
You don't want these horsemen to become our enemies again.
Don't worry, Captain.
We know how to defend ourselves.
Sure.
Like the Delormes family.
Be careful, boss.
The marabout said, "The time has come.
"Take the Frenchman's land, sheep and wife.
Everything!"
Then everyone chanted, "God is great."
They've been saying this for 20 years, but we're still here.
The workers!
- What about them?
- They left.
- The workers, sheep,
- horses and mules, all gone!
- Do you know where they went?
No.
- They're all gone?
They even took their shoes!
I thought they hurt their feet!
- They can sell them at the souk.
- And the cattle?
- You think they stole all this?
The Hadjout.
Mr. Saïd listened and cheered on the marabout.
- Take this and guard the farm.
- Where are you going, boss?
To get a horse - and find them. - Be careful, boss.
Hadjouts are very mean.
- Let me call the army.
- Certainly not! - There'd be a massacre.
- Hadjouts will butcher you.
They know who I am.
Thanks for the horse!
What if Leila was right?
I'm a doctor, not a farmer.
Maybe I should give up and leave.
Then I realized it's too late.
We have to stay, change these people, give them laws, civilize them.
I was crazy about Algeria.
It's such a beautiful country.
I come as a friend.
- Where are my workers?
- They work for us now.
You work your own brothers like slaves?
Punishment for their betrayal.
The Hadjouts I met were Abdelkader's best warriors. Now they're just cutthroat murderous cowards!
They violated a saint's grave! That's sacrilege!
They were punished.
It's God's law.
- Pay!
Heard that? They want your wife.
We'll visit your wife. She'll pay for you.
Kill me now.
We'll show her this and she'll come get you.
She'll bring the army.
You'll all be shot!
Aïcha...
I read your articles and pamphlet on Algeria.
Let me say that I completely disagree with your arabophile views.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I suppose you're an arabophobe?
Call it what you will.
As departmental head of the Algerian government my views are not theoretical, but based on real things.
I thought we were discussing people - and not things.
- What are your views?
The cross and the crescent are irreconcilable.
Christians and Muslims cannot live together unless one dominates the other.
- Why should Christians dominate?
- It's the law of the jungle.
You're shocked?
This is how it's been throughout history.
We're the masters of Algeria.
Why can't the cross and the crescent get along?
The Arabs have refused to cooperate these last 20 years.
They wage wars on us, cut our settlers' throats, burn our farms, dream of throwing us in the sea.
It's because we see them as the defeated and not as partners.
What if Cossacks or Prussians still occupied Paris? If they had burned your family home in Normandy, seized your land and destroyed your churches?
Forgive me, General, but I refuse to continue to debate with someone who compares our troops to Cossacks!
This is insufferable!
Come, darling.
Can you believe that fool?
To think they're considering him for the secretary general position in Algiers.
He treated me like a "moukère." I put him in his place.
You should have seen the look on his face!
You did well, Bahia.
General Fleury offered me an assignment in Algiers.
My articles and my book are quite popular over there.
- Say you'll take me with you.
And we'll visit Odilon.
I haven't heard from him in over a year.
Leila wrote me that she's worried about him.
- You were with those thieves?
- When Abdelkader surrendered, I took my wife and son and went home with a broken heart.
How is your son?
- I'm trying to make him a man.
- May Allah watch over him.
Abdelkader and I only wished to go to the Mecca, but the French didn't keep their word and kept him prisoner.
So I joined the Hadjout. You saw it:
Lions became vultures. - Murderers.
- It's not their fault.
The French are stronger.
You fought valiantly.
The time for peace has come.
I'll speak to Governor Randon on your behalf.
He's the only one I trust.
It's up to him.
Enough about God!
He helps those who help themselves!
My mind's made up. I'm going to Algiers.
You're deserting, Hubert.
Farming is hard work,
- but we can't give up. - My wife was right.
We're not made to live this way.
You'll find someone else to lease the farm.
That's not the problem.
Spaniards can work it.
Think it over.
Boss, I want to go to Algiers with you.
I can guard your house, take the children to school, - anything!
- Of course.
- Your wife will be thrilled.
She cried a lot when I took her to Blida.
You're like a mother and father to me.
I fell in love with the white city of Algiers that embraces the Mediterranean shore.
Leila had waited for me and forgiven me.
She worked as a nurse, was radiantly happy, had found her place in society.
I finally set up my own practice.
Algiers's European community was expanding by the day.
I had become convinced the only way to save this country was to make it a French province.
Not for military men, but for settlers turning this place into a new country.
Odilon!
Let me introduce our copy editor, Benjamin Bensoussan, and Jeanne, the "Illustration" correspondent.
Excuse me. What do you think of this?
I went all out.
It's 4 pages long.
There's your biography, what happened to you, everything!
You'll become a hero to the colony!
Here's your tale.
You're very talented!
I said that before, haven't I?
We should team up.
I could sell you half my shares.
- I don't have any money.
- Same here!
Buy them on credit.
- Let's shake on it.
- Sold. I'm for the settlers, now I know how they operate.
You finally got it.
It's all here in my editorial.
"Paris's indifference. "The army's incompetence and arrogance.
"Native laziness."
Read the conclusion! I showed Randon what's what!
"Down with the sword. It's time for civil power.
"Algeria is French!"
- Want to show me around?
- With pleasure.
Children, did you know your father is a hero?
It's in all the newspapers.
- Don't exaggerate.
- I heard about it in school.
Why are you a hero, Father?
Did you kill a lot of Arabs?
- No. Why would you think that?
- When we play cops and robbers, the robbers are always Arabs.
I'll have a word with your teacher!
They won't let me be a cop.
- They say I'm mixed.
What's that?
Someone who's half-half.
Half French and half Arab.
- Am I half Arab?
- I don't wanna be!
You're not.
You're a quarter Kabyle.
- Pass me the jam.
- Isn't that the same?
Kabyles are not Arabs.
So I can be a cop.
Of course you can play cop, but you can't kill anyone.
- Hurry up, you'll be late.
Make sure you pay attention.
- Do we understand each other?
- Yes.
Everyone is talking about you.
I like it here.
I feel like I'm in France.
- But with Arabs.
- We live separately here.
I have to go.
General Randon asked me to come see him.
So, Hubert, you want to bite the hand that fed you?
You're a retired officer, aren't you?
- I am, General.
- And you write for this rag, run by Roucariès.
A Commie!
We should have sent him to New Caledonia.
- He's a Republican, General.
- A Commie! An anarchist!
He defends mercenaries, adventurers and deportees who come to Algeria to exploit native labor!
Let me remind you, General, that the settlers are colonizing and farming this land - on behalf of France.
- Land that the army conquered!
We'll discuss this some other time.
I asked you here because you're familiar with the Mitidja.
I'm worried. New incidents have been reported.
Marabout Sidi Yacoub travels the area and gets them all worked up.
It's an epidemic!
Reports of so-called marabouts all over the country, calling for "jihad."
- They have monkeys and goats. - It's an old tradition.
They capture the imagination of the naïve and ignorant who fall for their cheap tricks.
- They're illusionists.
- Exactly.
- Ever heard of Robert Houdin?
Your marabouts couldn't hold a candle to him.
- I asked Paris to send him here.
- I fail to see the connection.
Arabs are a superstitious people.
They're amazed by sleight of hand.
I'll show them a better magician than all their marabouts.
Robert Houdin!
General Bugeaud once tried to send them false prophets.
They were all murdered.
This is different!
This one's French!
I'd bet you anything that he'll amaze them!
He amazed me, so...
The Arabs want to see wonders, so I'll show them wonders!
One last thing, I'm told you're friends with an author called Toussaint, a man turning Paris upside down, demanding that Arabs
- be considered our equals?
- I am. He's here, on a mission for General Fleury.
I had to give him an office.
I'm not sure what he's up to, but I don't like it, so I'm having him followed.
Try to get some information out of him and keep me apprized.
Want some wine, boss?
Ahmed, I told you to call him "sir."
Want some wine, sire?
- Sir.
- No, I'm fine, Yaouled.
And stop calling him Yaouled.
His name's Ahmed.
Didn't I tell you?
I decided we should Frenchify our lifestyle.
I ordered Restoration armchairs.
I like the sitting room the way it is.
That stuck-up woman at the General's asked if I was a Moor!
That's why. That's not an insult.
You're half Spanish, a quarter Kabyle and a quarter French.
And the end result is not bad at all.
I'm French!
I don't want people thinking I'm a "moukère!"
Did you know the Toussaints were here?
The moved into one of the best palaces in Algiers.
I know. He's important now.
He's General Fleury's agent and speaks for Parisian arabophiles.
I saw Bahia this afternoon.
She's putting on airs now that she's lived in Paris.
- Sauce?
She invited us to dinner tomorrow night.
I'm looking forward to seeing Hélie.
- Isn't this a bit cold?
Sorry, but it is.
Yaouled?
Could we have forks?
I don't eat with my hands anymore.
I don't understand why you stopped writing me.
You let me down.
You'd promised to ask your friends to help me.
- Sorry, it wasn't easy with all these changes of regime: first a kingdom, then a republic, and now an empire.
- You don't know how it is.
Judging by your stripes, you didn't do too badly during these hard times...
You've changed.
While you were having fun in Paris, - I went through hell here!
- Why did you become a settler?
That's enough.
I've heard enough.
Go see how they live on the Mitidja!
I now understand what "bad settlers" are.
- How are your children?
- Well.
And yours?
Well.
I'd like them to live here.
They're lucky enough to study in France.
I'd like them to know their homeland and to speak Arabic.
What for?
What's important is that they speak French.
It's their culture, their roots.
I don't want them to deny their origins, like others do.
Is this why you still wear a "jellaba"?
I'm proud to wear it.
And it will never go out of style.
It's their damn religion that puts them to sleep.
Medieval fatalism.
What are you doing to help them?
Touring Robert Houdin disguised as a marabout?
You want them to stay ignorant so you can dominate them.
We have to defend ourselves.
Your desertion policy would have us all leave within 5 years.
Did you forget our dream of uniting the East and the West?
Only equality and progress can give Arabs their dignity back.
They don't want your progress.
Ask our Saint-Simonian brothers. Ask Talabot.
They're sabotaging his railroad.
To modernize the country, we need to impose our laws and our better institutions. It's not only in our interest,
- but in theirs.
- Am I really hearing this?
You sound like those colonialists I keep meeting here in Algiers!
I found more support for Algerians in Paris!
It's easy to be pro-Arab when you live in Paris.
No one is on your side here, not governor, army or settlers.
You've already lost the battle.
I'll be frank.
Your newspaper is jeopardizing our collaboration with Arabs.
This might result in a war.
There's nothing left to be said.
Goodbye.
How sad.
They're hopeless.
Misfortune has made them bitter.
I, Hadj Hamou, give you my horse as well as this sword with which I've always fought fairly.
My life is in your hands.
You can have my son as a symbol of my sincerity.
May God help you decide our fate.
As a show of faith, I'll let you keep your sword and horse, but I'll take care of your son.
He can serve France when he's older.
Go back to your people and live peacefully.
Drum roll!
I'll only use it to defend my new friends if they're attacked.
I'll see to it that he goes to a good school, so he can follow in his father's footsteps.
France's flag is wide and can shelter all those who seek refuge and protection.
I spent 20 years of my life fighting, killing and destroying.
I will now devote myself to peace and rebuilding.
I could take care of him and his studies.
Under one condition.
That you let him be Muslim.
I swear to your God and mine to do so.
I'll care for him as if he were my own.
How long will that boy stay in our home?
It'll depend on his studies.
He eats with his hands. He doesn't know how to use a fork.
This is what we're here for.
You treat that child better than your own.
- Good night, Father.
Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Sidi Baba.
You're not his father.
He's only repeating what he's heard.
You've got a new nightgown.
Where did you get it?
I got some proper clothes.
Why do you always hide that you're kind-hearted?
- I want to see Father. - Go on.
- Stop touching my things!
Don't mind him. He's just mean.
You can play with me.
A pearl.
- A chair.
- A table.
- A pearl.
Not a pearl.
A girl.
"A girl."
"A boy." A girl. A boy.
Go to bed.
But say your prayers first.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women...
I was a medical officer, he, an interpreter.
It was a mythical Algeria.
Wanting Arabs to abide by French rules would be a mistake.
They're our partners,...
The doc is a spy.
Watch his every move.
- Bring me all his letters.
She's here to spy on you.
That's what the Arabs do!
This is a war of conquest and extermination of Arabs.
Some Parisian newspapers even wrote that we're the barbarians.
Algeria is and must remain a French province.
I hadn't left the army, I had been kicked out for being republican and pro-Arab.
After having conquered this land in the name of France, you will now farm it. And make it your new home!
Can't the cross and the crescent get along?
They have different customs and values.
They're savages!
You'll all be shot!
You didn't do too badly during these hard times...
You want to bite the hand that fed you?
You write for this rag?
You sound like those colonialists I keep meeting here in Algiers!
It's easy to be pro-Arab when you live in Paris.
- Ours.
I couldn't show my happiness.
I hope we won't regret raising this child as ours.
Why would we?
My son Aïssa looked so much like Naouel, whom I had loved so much.
What was in store for him?
L'Algérie des chimères A DREAM OF ALGERIA 3.
THE ARAB KINGDOM
You're so handsome and strong, my son.
You're the one who's beautiful, Mom.
- You are.
I'm old now.
Your father doesn't look at me anymore.
- He took a new wife. Very young.
- Another one?
Since you joined the French, he took 2 wives to sire children.
I'm not a good mare.
I only had one son.
I think polygamy is barbaric.
You sound like a Frenchman.
It's the "Kaida." The Prophet had 9 wives.
- What's the new wife's name?
- She's from a noble clan.
She is jealous of me.
Wanted me sent to the kitchen.
You're coming to Algiers, to stay with me.
Be reassured, son.
Your father respects and protects me.
Besides, I don't want to be a burden on you.
It's time for you to get married.
I chose a nice girl for you from a good family. Very pretty and sweet.
Sixteen. Nice hips, not like me.
She'll give you beautiful kids.
- You don't want to get married?
Your brothers are already engaged, but your father won't let them marry because you're the eldest.
I want to choose my own wife.
You love someone else.
A French woman?
Not even to your mother?
I don't know if her parents will allow it.
- It's because you're an Arab.
It's more complicated.
No, it isn't.
Be careful Aïssa.
The French are hypocrites.
They're against polygamy, but they all have mistresses.
They won't give you their daughter.
Love can break all barriers.
Time erases all... even love.
Your old mother... knows.
Abdallah seems to be managing well.
I'm not used to it anymore.
You can study here.
I slowly built up a nice library.
I even found manuscripts that belonged to Emir Abdelkader.
May God protect him in exile.
France stole you from us, Aïssa.
You forgot that you gave me to France.
It made me into an officer.
It's like a mother to me.
There are 2 France, Aïssa.
That's what I learned.
In Paris, France made you an officer and freed Italy. Here, France keeps Algeria under its yoke.
The governor is seizing our land to give to the colonists.
What do they want?
Herd us in the Sahara?
I'm certain Napoleon III is against confinement.
Five tribal elders and I are to meet him in Compiègne.
We'll see if he's on our side.
- We must trust him.
- May God hear you... and inspire him truth and justice.
Aïssa was back.
What joy to see my son again after 3 years of absence, now a grown man covered in glory under the French banner.
- At Magenta and Solferino?
- Yes.
- You lucky devil. - Émile.
War is no joke, except for kings and emperors. Victory in Solferino cost thousands of lives.
Yes, but we saved the Italians from Austrian occupation.
What a beautiful uniform.
You look handsome.
- Dinner is ready.
- Let's go.
Tell us all about it.
To Aïssa.
I looked at Aïssa.
He was proof that one could be a good Frenchman and a good a Muslim.
Did he embody the successful union of the East and the West?
I started to believe in it again.
I don't like the way Aïssa looks at Jeanne.
- Going out?
With those goo goo eyes of his.
- Didn't you notice?
- Suppose he's in love with her.
- What are you talking about?
I hope we won't regret raising this child as ours.
On the contrary.
He's the perfect example of integration.
- He's like a Frenchman.
- Perhaps. But he isn't.
He is by the blood he spilled, fighting for France.
That's fine, but I don't want him to touch my daughter.
He's staying in town and wants to be his own man.
I have something to tell you, Jeanne.
I love war.
I discovered a new homeland:
In the army, barriers fall.
I'm not a Muslim among Catholics or an Arab among French.
I'm a soldier among soldiers. All equal before death.
Only one rule: courage.
- Do you understand?
- I don't know. It's a male world where women have no place.
I'm bored, Aïssa.
I need to do something useful, exciting, unique.
Sometimes I envy the fate of colonist women.
It's dangerous but so exciting.
Jeanne. Will you marry me?
Of course.
When we were little, we said we'd get married.
Will your parents let their daughter marry a Muslim?
I don't know about Dad.
Mother won't.
- Where is Miss Jeanne?
- Outside.
How are you feeling?
You've been odd, lately.
You can trust me.
Among women, we can understand each other.
Nothing is troubling me.
A mother feels such things.
You're a big girl, Jeanne.
It's time to think about your future.
There're many young officers from good families in Algiers.
I'll invite some for you to meet.
- I'm not in a hurry to marry.
- Then you'll be an old maid.
Mother!
What are you driving at?
I don't want you to fall for just anyone.
That's all.
- That's what it is. - Yes.
That's what it is.
You've changed since Aïssa's return.
- You have a soft spot for him.
- Not a soft spot.
We want to get married.
Marry an Arab?
A Muslim?
Marriage is something serious.
You marry someone with the same religion and background.
I forbid you to see this boy.
I forbid you.
Understood?
Yes.
- I knew it.
I told you. - Thank you.
And you thought they were like brother and sister.
I'll call the police if he sets foot in here again.
What's gotten into you?
We raised him as one or ours.
Unfortunately, yes.
Anyway you always had a soft spot for him.
- I don't want him to touch her.
He won't have the chance anyway.
His regiment is leaving for France, then Mexico.
- When?
- I don't know.
The Emperor wants Maximilian of Austria in Mexico.
How can you say that.
It's war over there.
Maybe he'll get killed.
Is Jeanne there?
Get out!
Beat it!
Never set foot in this house!
- You had no right to stop him.
- You do what you're told.
You can't stop me.
I'll leave, come what may.
I'll join him, become a Muslim if need be.
- Go to your room!
Don't you ever, again.
- I escaped from home.
- Are you out of your mind?
- I came to say goodbye.
- I want to be yours.
I can't believe it!
Look at this!
See the news?
Your circumcised pal is taking 5 elders to see the Emperor.
- Did you know?
- No.
- We're not close anymore.
- They are plotting in Compiègne, with General Fleury and the Saint-Simonians.
- What do they want?
- Arabize us.
Saïd, come with me.
Take care of yourself!
This trip is very important for me.
The Emperor has decided.
He read my books.
He plans a new Algeria policy, my policy.
Can you understand that?
- You'll see the kids at least. - Of course.
I'll write every day and tell you what's happening.
"Dear Bahia, you can't imagine how lavishly
"the Emperor received our Arab friends at Compiègne."
"Everything is so wonderful.
"The Emperor held long talks with the elders.
"He promised complete equality between Europeans and Arabs.
"'That's but fair, honorable and right, ' he told them. "Who were delighted, you can imagine.
"It's truly a revolution."
"The native chiefs gave the Emperor a black stallion, "a magnificent offspring of the famous Godolphin Arabian, "father of all thoroughbreds.
"His Majesty has a special place for it.
"'We'll be able to compete with the British, ' Gen. Fleury said.
"Her Majesty the Empress and the Imperial Prince "showed our friends consideration and appreciation.
"The Emperor recognized Aïssa, whom he decorated at Magenta. "He also introduced him to the Empress.
"His father, Hadj Hamou, was filled with pride.
"Finally, His Majesty did me the honor
"to explain in detail his project to our friends "to turn Algeria into an Arab Kingdom."
Dear friends, here's the man whose works have inspired the Emperor's policy.
No one can better explain it to you.
I'll give him the floor.
The Emperor asked me to tell you that we didn't come to Algeria to oppress or plunder, but to bring you the blessings of civilization.
He wants to make Algeria an Arab Kingdom.
Henceforth, he'll protect you, as he does the French.
He is both Emperor of the French and King of the Arabs.
- In practice, what does it mean?
- Firstly... the Emperor will end the confinement policy.
Your title to traditional tribal lands will be recognized.
No more despoliation.
- Will land be ours?
- It will belong to the tribes.
Later, everyone will have a share.
Secondly... Following the proclamation of full European-Arab equality, the Emperor shall grant French citizenship to Jews and Arabs who so desire.
We know France brings progress and we are grateful.
But we'd rather live according to our own laws and customs.
For us Muslims, religion rules everything.
The Koran is our civil code, our book of science and medicine, the Word of God.
I assure you, all your views will be taken into account.
Let us begin.
What's your impression?
They are delighted by their stay.
They were also charmed by His Majesty.
I think they'll agree with the Arab Kingdom model, except for Si Kadour, my father-in-law.
We have to handle him carefully.
He's very influential in Kabylia.
In any event, it's imperative for His Majesty to come to Algeria to launch his policy.
It will provoke colonist and military opposition.
It's only a question of timing.
If Pélissier doesn't like it, we'll replace him.
Talabot has been waiting for you for half an hour.
- Paulin, I'm happy to see you.
- Odilon.
- What are you doing in Algiers?
- Big news, old pal.
Next week, we'll be laying down the last railroad track. We're also inaugurating the new Blida station.
Marshal Pélissier...
I hope you'll write a nice article.
Is the paper yours?
I bought 50% from Roucariès, but it's not doing well.
I have to meet Pélissier.
I gave Roucariès all the details.
- See you later at the café.
Is Mr. Talabot a Saint-Simonian?
I heard you were too.
Does this sect still exist?
They're scattered, but still have influence at the court, among university students and bankers.
Here's the article. Lately, they've become like the Freemasons.
What do they want?
The utopians like Toussaint believe in Santa Claus.
The others believe in progress, thinking that with money, factories, mines and railroads, they can solve everything.
The paradox is that they began as socialists, and now they're big capitalists.
I saw Hélie yesterday.
We spoke about you and old times.
It seems you had a falling out?
We have nothing to say to each other.
He's Gen. Fleury's man. He heads the pro-Arab camp that wants to sell out Algeria.
We disagree about the future of this country.
You're both wrong.
Hélie thinks that the French and Arabs can live as equals.
You want to turn them into Frenchmen.
That's an illusion.
And you?
What's your solution? I... build.
I build railroads and roads, dig the ground, plant trees.
I represent progress, a sort of charity.
I deal with reality, not dreams.
Do you know what Arabs say about your railroad?
"Al-rabat sheitan," the devil's cart.
Let's have lunch.
Good piece, Benjamin!
You'll do the next on the army's anti-confinement action.
- Look!
Nice layout.
- Yes.
Boy, come here.
It's time I tell him.
I have bad news.
- I can't pay you.
You haven't paid him in 2 months.
It's not my fault if we don't have money.
Half the colonists are Spanish and can't read French.
- I got an idea.
Struck gold?
- Serious?
- Where?
- Here in Algiers. - What is it?
- My dad's pockets.
We're always ready to help our French friends.
From the start of conquest we offered France our services.
We know the Turks and Arabs well, Mr. Hubert.
We've dealt with them for 2 centuries, since my ancestors came from Leghorn to trade between Barbary Coast pirates and Italian merchants.
Please, sit down.
We know your father advises Gen. Bugeaud on Arab affairs.
Benjamin told me about your paper's financial difficulties.
That shouldn't be a problem. My eldest son David, who runs our bank, can help you.
Did you hear me?
With a special rate for friends.
Thank you very much. Let me also say how much we appreciate Benjamin's intelligence, skills and talents.
Yes, Benjamin.
I sent him to law school in Montpellier. It cost a bundle, but we wanted him to be our lawyer.
But in France, he caught the political bug.
Politics seals the fate of nations.
Trade is safer.
Business is business, whoever is in power.
Since your paper deals with politics, I've a favor to ask.
Please, tell me.
As head of the Jewish Council, I'm host to a French Member of Parliament who is concerned about our small community. His name is Adolphe Crémieux.
I hope he gets French citizenship for Algerian Jews.
I thought you weren't interested in politics.
It's, let's say, about religion.
We'll be glad to interview him.
Tell him to come to the paper.
Actually, thank you for what you're doing for the paper.
It's for a good cause, that of a French Algeria where Jews will play an important role.
Since that is the case, could you arrange a meeting between myself as head of the Jewish Council, and the governor-general?
The army and I aren't...
You can see to it with my son Daniel.
- See you tomorrow... 8 AM?
- Yes.
Bahia?
- Had a good trip?
- A bit long.
- I missed you.
- You too. - Come!
- You're still as beautiful.
Tell me about the kids.
They're well.
They send their love and miss you.
Ahmed got his Ph.D. in law with honors.
Now he can practice in Algiers.
- I'm not sure he wants to.
- You'll get upset.
- Tell me!
He thinks he won't make it in Algiers.
He's decided to stay in Paris and changed his name.
- He now calls himself Amédée.
- My son Ahmed?
Don't be upset!
I don't like it, but I can understand him.
In Paris, an Arab name sticks out like a turban.
Many Jews and Poles took French names.
He won't be the first.
Then, why aren't French taking Arab names here?
It's a religious thing.
The French take saints' names.
- I won't have it.
- Bahia!
I'll write him what I think.
Things will change.
Ahmed might too.
The Emperor accepted our proposals.
Algeria will be an Arab Kingdom with equal citizens.
It will be a tough sell.
Everyone is against you.
- You must be hungry.
Marshal Pélissier will see you.
- Some port as you wait?
- No, thanks.
A cigar?
Besides, it's Ramadan.
I forgot.
The governor is in a foul mood.
He got orders from Paris, he doesn't like.
I think I know what they are.
So you're here.
Did you put all this nonsense in His Majesty's head?
My respects, Marshal.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't be so coy!
This letter of instructions from His Majesty,
which he personally signed.
It talks about the end of the confinement policy, about the Arab Kingdom,
and Arab-European equality.
Did you put him up to it?
It's full of your books' subversive language... and that of your friends, Fleury, David...
You flatter me thinking I have such influence on His Majesty.
No doubletalk.
Hear this, little fellow!
I was on the beach when we landed.
I didn't give 30 years of my life to this country to see it given to the Arabs who'll mess it up.
I won't ever accept that!
May I remind you, Sir. The country belongs to the Arabs.
We took it with our blood.
And especially with theirs.
Listen, Toussaint!
We aren't dreamers, visionaries.
We build.
We're turning Algeria into a modern country bringing comfort to the colonists and progress to the natives.
There is no other viable plan.
All else is idle talk for frustrated intellectuals a bit like you.
You won't build anything without the Algerians.
Toussaint...
You might be the smartest, but I warn you... I shall stop you.
God be my witness! I'm the strongest.
I too have connections in the court.
Perhaps you forget that my wife is the Empress' cousin.
- May I go, Marshal?
- Get out!
And don't get in my way or you'll regret it.
What arrogance!
I asked the Emperor to remove this good-for-nothing.
He's General Fleury's man and he's backed by the Emperor.
By Jove, we'll see who's the strongest.
Keep your smooth talk for Paris.
When we came here, there was nothing but desert, swamps, flies and dwarf palms.
One third of us died of cholera.
One third gave up and rented the land to the Arabs.
We are the last third.
We survived massacres, disease, drought, grasshoppers.
We won't give in to your Arab Kingdom.
Listen! Why end confinement?
Algeria has 3.5 million people. It can feed 20.
We have 12 million hectares of uncultivated land. And you want to stop colonization.
Thousands of colonists can come.
Why leave good land to the Arabs?
Either their herds destroy it, or they badly farm it.
- We produce 6 times they do.
It's our land.
We created a new France here.
Friends, the land belongs to the natives, the colonists and the army.
The Emperor declared it an Arab Kingdom, a European colony and a military camp.
Arrant nonsense.
It's crystal clear to me.
First, we're not your friends, Toussaint. Ruling means choosing.
It's either us or them.
Tell your Emperor that no one will throw us out.
This is our home.
Our enemies want to give power to the Arabs.
If they win, that'll toll the bell for us.
- Do you want to become Arab?
We'll remain French. We won't bow to Napoleon the puny... King of the Arabs!
We are now 200,000 Europeans.
We can't be dismissed.
We've rallied the colonists, and all true republicans:
printers, masons, merchants, and architects.
- Are the Jews with us?
- Of course. They might not dare come out, but I'm here.
We'll mobilize the women and demonstrate with you.
Down with the Emperor!
We had a feverish month.
Algiers was under siege. Every day, people heard our call. Women too.
- French Algeria!
French Algeria! - Present arms!
Get ready!
Let us through.
We're going to the government house.
- The street is closed.
- Let us through!
- Forward!
- French Algeria!
Take it easy!
I'm not unhappy about the protests.
They show Paris the futility of its abandonment policy.
Even women are getting into the act.
That's too much.
These people are hotheads a bit quick-tempered, but they cool down as quickly.
Don't forget!
We're south of Marseille.
Anyway, make sure the troops aren't trigger-happy.
Break some skulls if you must, but no fire.
I don't want any violence.
No more violence.
It cooled down after a month.
Mar. Pélissier died from pneumonia. The Arab Kingdom policy had its first setback.
Neither Jews nor Arabs wanted to give up their special status in exchange for French citizenship.
Only 200 Arabs out of 3 million applied for it. Aïssa was one of them and had his own reasons.
- Thanks but I don't drink.
- Of course.
I came to ask you for Jeanne's hand, officially.
My regiment leaves for Mexico and we would like to be engaged before I leave.
Aïssa. You and Jeanne cannot marry.
You're too young, practically brother and sister.
A Kabyle proverb says, "Marry within your tribe,
"within your village, and if possible, within your family."
You belong to different worlds.
What?
I'm French now.
Yes, but you're also Muslim.
Do you know the obstacles you'll be facing?
Jeanne will want a church wedding.
What will your family say?
- There're other mixed couples.
- They're the exception.
Your friend Hélie Toussaint married a Muslim woman.
Yes, but he converted, and now stands disowned by his family.
Let's not beat around the bush. Is it yes or no?
Aïssa. I'd like to say yes but it's impossible.
Believe me.
It's no, then.
What if we eloped without your permission?
My Arab blood was acceptable on the battlefield.
In Paris, they saw fit to grant me French citizenship.
But they forgot to tell me it was a second class passport, because here in Algiers, I'm always an outsider, a native.
Even for you.
It's all clear now.
When you return, I'll be of age.
I'll leave home.
We'll marry and live in France.
We still have to wait.
I'll wait for as long as it takes.
Napoleon III came to Algeria twice to proclaim himself King of the Arabs.
He was delighted.
He ate ostrich eggs, roasted gazelle and lion meat.
Everywhere, huge Arab crowds cheered him.
Our paper had to concede his great success, organized, it must be said, by the Arab Office.
Hélie acted as his interpreter throughout his stay.
It was his hour of glory.
He thought he'd seen the dawn of the Arab Kingdom. History decided otherwise.
Look at this!
Four years of drought, famine, cholera, and grasshoppers.
All at once in just 4 years.
They're eating grass, roots and even leaves.
People are dropping like flies from hunger and cholera.
Where are the French doctors?
Cholera isn't racist. Frenchmen have died from it too.
Even Bugeaud died from it in Paris.
Did you see how the peasant treated me?
When you privatized collective land, you broke up the tribe,
It's the price of progress and of a fairer, modern society.
Do you know what they did with the arid land you gave them?
They sold it to the colonists for a pittance.
People here are superstitious.
They're saying the Arab Kingdom has the evil eye.
I'm sorry, but all you've done for us is turning against us.
All the same, you can't blame us for drought, grasshoppers, and disease.
Bad luck hounds us.
People say it's God's vengeance because we didn't defend our land against the infidels.
Tell the governor that if France does nothing, there'll be war.
- Warn him.
- I will.
Tell him that I lost a son... to cholera, and that my youngest might go into the mountains.
- You know what that means?
- It's cholera.
Quick. She's being waiting for you for 2 days.
My son... apple of my eye.
- You came to say farewell.
You'll pull through.
God picks the hour and mine has come.
I've a secret to tell you.
A secret?
Yes, Aïssa. One that I've carried in my heart since you were born.
Odilon is your father.
You mustn't marry Jeanne.
Forgive me, Aïssa!
I mixed infidel blood... with that of the true warriors of the faith.
I was young, a harem slave.
During the Tafna peace,
Odilon was Abdelkader's doctor.
You were born after that.
Hadj Hamou raised you. He taught you to walk, to ride a horse, and to use a sword and rifle.
He taught you right from wrong, and courage.
He taught you the true religion.
He's your father too.
I had made a promise.
I will always be fond of Jeanne.
Promise me never to tell her.
If it does, I'll fight by your side.
You can't, Aïssa.
That'd give you away.
Have you forsaken your religion?
I haven't.
One day, France will allow its citizens to be Catholic, Jewish or Muslim.
France... maybe.
But we won't here, son, not on Muslim soil.
You're French now.
You must leave and fulfill your destiny.
But my heart will forever be in Algeria.
Is it another woman?
Be honest.
My mother has chosen my future wife.
I cannot refuse.
It's tradition, you see.
What'll you do, all alone in Paris?
Where will you stay?
With Aunt Inès.
I'll take a job as a nurse.
I'll treat the wounded on the front.
I'll defend France.
You want to go with him.
You want to be with your Arab!
Throwing yourself at him like that!
Look at yourself.
A Kabyle raped your grandmother!
You're an Arab too!
The bad Arabs like raping women like you!
Our armies are getting defeated everywhere:
Wissembourg, Reichshoffen-Froeschwiller...
What a disgrace!
What possessed the Emperor to wage war on Prussia?
Bismarck was waiting for it.
New headline!
The Emperor was captured and abdicated.
Gambetta declared a new republic.
A new republic, my friends!
Follow me!
Saïd? I couldn't believe it.
The Emperor had been captured.
They'd declared a new republic.
My old dream had finally come true!
I'm the lieutenant commander!
You should leave before my friends get here.
Listen to them. They're jubilant.
Don't be a hero, it's best you flee.
Where's Toussaint?
Where's that sly fox?
Vanished.
We'll get him sooner or later.
While the French are fighting each other,
- let's throw them into the sea.
We must save the Arab Kingdom.
They say they're republicans, but you know them.
They're colonialists, arabophobes...
Let's rouse the tribes and drive the French out!
We've talked enough.
I'll rouse my troops and fight!
Come with me to Oran, Bahia.
You can't stay in Algiers.
Bahia...
I beg you...
Do this for me.
It's too dangerous here.
I'll try to go to Paris on my own.
Meet me there.
The French government has fled to Tours.
By God, France is collapsing!
We should declare independence.
Send us Garibaldi and Algeria will take care of itself, just like Italy.
You want us to fight 3 million Arabs all by ourselves?
- What are the other wires?
- Nothing important.
Say, what do you think of...
What's wrong?
"On the front, the incredible bravery "of the 'Chasseurs d'Afrique, ' Algerian soldiers and Zouaves,
"cost them dearly.
"The second 'Turcos' was bled dry.
"Its officers were killed in action."
The second "Turcos..." That's Aïssa's regiment!
Military rule is over.
Algeria has been split into 3 departments governed by French law.
The departments will be run by a prefect and by members of Parliament.
The governor-general must now be a civilian, under the Ministry of the Interior.
We've won, my friends!
Algeria is both civilian and French!
A French Algeria!
- Long live French Algeria!
- Wait. Settle down. There's more.
The 33,000 Algerian Jews are now automatically French.
- Will we be allowed to vote?
- What about the Arabs?
- Not for now. Phew!
My heart stopped.
Thousands of "Turcos" and Zouaves died on the battlefield. They voted with their blood.
A minute of silence for our Muslim brothers who died for France.
Why did you keep that from me?
I had made a promise.
How could you keep such a secret to yourself this long?
"Dear father, "you reading this letter means I was killed in action."
"Don't cry.
"I'll gladly give France the life you've given me "that has nothing left in store for me.
"I will finally rest in peace "under the watchful eye of the 2 Gods who ruled "over my life and death."
"The almighty God of the Arabs, who controls good and evil "and the merciful Christian God "who can forgive every sin."
"I'm writing you to remind you of your promise."
"Jeanne... "must never find out."
"Never."
"Farewell.
"Your son, Aïssa."
Why did he reject me?
Hey Arab!
Stay where you are!
Don't move, Arab!
I didn't know where else to go.
Where's Bahia?
She went to Oran with her father.
Why didn't you take her with you?
I'd have looked after her.
Have you eaten?
I'll go make your bed.
You can't stay in Algeria.
They'll kill you.
You can spend the night here. Tomorrow, I'll put you on a boat to Spain.
I paid half already.
Give them the rest when you arrive.
This is a safe-conduct.
And a pistol.
It could come in handy.
- What a beautiful country.
- Our country.
- What happened to us, Odilon?
- Life.
Do you remember Ménilmontant?
Uniting the East and the West?
Why did you forsake our ideals?
They were utopian.
The Arab Kingdom is not utopian.
Just the opposite. It's realistic.
You'll see it too one day.
Why do you force your ideals on me?
Mine are as good as yours.
I want this land to become a part of France, of Republican France. Freedom, equality, fraternity.
Freedom? Or the right for the strong to oppress the weak!
Not necessarily.
Republican education will turn these Arabs into good French citizens.
It'll take time, but I'm optimistic.
They should become good Algerian citizens, instead!
You're bound to fail!
The future will decide.
- God will decide.
What happened to Toussaint?
I'm told he went back to Algeria.
How come?
He followed his own path, alone, which doesn't surprise me.
You never saw him again?
Wasn't he a friend?
You see, we never parted ways.
You know, we need utopians, dreamers.
The world couldn't exist without them.
Excuse me, I must go now.
It's rather cold in here, wouldn't you agree?
It is.
After a while, the cold gets to you.
It's just awful.
Translation:
Previously on Childrens Hospital... 18, 19, 20.
Ready or not, here I come.
Gotcha!
Aah!
You peeked.
You were peeking.
I wasn't.
You're a cheating bitch!
Come on.
Nice try, Eric.

Looks like somebody's having a bad head day.
Detective Chance Briggs, you old bucket of shrimps.
What's my old partner doing here?
The yoozh.
What's with the water coming out of the face?
He was my ex-boyfriend.
I loved his head. The victim had his head ripped clean off.
Look familiar to you, Maestro?
Looks an awful lot like that rash of murders 15 years ago.
Those were all boyfriends of yours, too, right, Cat?
It's almost enough to make a girl stop dating.
Or only date guys you want to see dead.
Can you find the person who did this?
Not on my own. I'm gonna need some help from my old partner.
I haven't been a cop for a long time.
It's in your blood, your glands.
I could smell it in you on our first day working together.
_
Detective Briggs?
I'm your new partner, Owen Maestro.
Ugh!
Rookie move, Maestro. Never let your guard down like that.
But section 19/a of the rule book says --
The rule book's never been out on the streets.
Sometimes, you got to bend the rules.
Sucker punch!
Sucker punch! But that's not what we learned at the academy.
The academy doesn't know crap.
Just ask the rule book. Release.
So, what's our assignment?
The Childrens Hospital murders.
They just found a fourth victim decapitated like the others.
Four decapitations, huh?
These victims sound like the Beatles of decapitations.
The Fab Four -- without heads.
I mean I've heard of "Help," but this is ridiculous.
Mop tops? How about no tops?
You know that song "Come Together"?
Well, this is like "Come Apart."
"I Want to Hold My Head."
"...on, so it doesn't get cut off."
This band is not gonna have the Talking Heads for an opening act.
Which one of you is in charge?
Well, that couldn't be me.
The only thing I'm in charge of is this.
Hey, uh, boss!
- These guys want to talk to you.
- Okay. Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Hi. I'm Brad Lendricks.
I'm the head paramedic.
It's about the recent killings at the hospital.
You mean the ones due to the serial killer or medical negligence?
Let's save the snaps for "Yo MTV Snaps."
Word is the paramedics are the eyes and ears of the hospital.
Brad can't help you.
No, he's always been mysteriously missing whenever a murder happened.
If you'll excuse me, I have to go stand over there.
If you ask me, Brad's glad all those guys got offed.
See, he's been in love with Cat for years, but she refuses to go out with him.
And now he's got a clear playing field.
A clearly stated motive.
Still, we need some solid evidence.
All we have on the guy is what this bald asshole told us.
No offense -- I'm sure you have some really great qualities, too.
I'm just going off of first impressions.
You know, I've always wanted to be a doctor.
Ever since I graduated medical school.
So, did you ever become a doctor?
Yeah. I've been a doctor for 15 years.
Oh, yeah, right.
That is not good enough, okay?
I want these tires to be white!
There's more urine where this came from.
There's that paramedic.
How do we know he was telling the truth 15 years ago?
Chet Mandvanteussen?
Just do it better next time.
We want to talk to you about the murder of Cat's most recent boyfriend.
You've done pretty well for yourself, haven't you, Mandvanteussen?
You're head paramedic now, your own ambulance, your own assistant.
Maybe. Doesn't mean I killed Cat's boyfriend.
It could have been anybody.
What about former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice?
Okay. Not her.
About 6 billion to go.
We need the personnel records on everyone who's worked here in the past 15 years.
Any files over 14 years old are converted into microfilm and then shipped to our storage facility in the Deep South where they are then destroyed.
I wish I could be more helpful.
Turn up anything?
And lots of it.
Just like we found at each of the other murder scenes.
Yeah, and according to the lab, all the semen samples came from the same person, probably male.
I would say definitely male.
My guess is Lendricks, but we can't know without a sample of his semen.
I like your haircut.
What is that, some kind of time machine?
This is a cutting-edge device used to identify DNA.
Welcome to the future, my friend.
And now I'll just call the lab.
It's the new Motorola clamshell, Briggs.
You never seen a cellphone?
Sure, but if I need to call someone, I'll use a pay phone.
This is more than just a phone, partner.
Look -- time and date.
Good God.
I guess it is a time and date machine.
- Chet, are you cleaning that gurney?
- Yes, sir! Hold it right there.
You're under arrest for the murder of --
Whoa! I want to talk to a lawyer!
The only lawyer you'll be talking to is one appointed to you by the court.
Veteran move, Maestro.
Wrong seat.
Could you get in the back, please?
Oh. There we go.
Thank you.
Zoe, thank you so much for your note.
That was so sweet.
Lendricks.
Last time we saw you, you were a man.
I made a deal with the District Attorney to be sent to the women's prison --
Better food, less athlete's foot, and the sex is amazing.
What? Anything goes!
We think your old assistant Chet may be copycatting you.
I didn't do it in the first place.
Wait. What?
Your semen was found at every crime scene.
Semen, semen, semen, semen!
I used to masturbate in the closets at work.
Is that a crime?
In Iraq, yes, and also here.
Okay, all I ask is that when you find this guy, you clear my name.
Except for the masturbating part.
I did do that, and I want that credit.
Look at us, huh?
Working a case, just like the first day we met.
Actually... It's time I told you about the real first day we met.
The year was 1992.
During my junior year at Oberlin, I took a part-time job at a veterinary hospital -- the night shift.
It was just me and the animals.
This is where he figures out who the murderer is.
As the months progressed, I had to figure out a way to pass the time...
You stupid ape.
You missed a straight diagonal move.
...but I was bored, so, of course, I started dressing up this one baboon in human clothes.
Just one more thing.
My name is Chance Briggs.
- Briggs. I own you.
Own.
Me Owen.
You Owen.
I'm gonna call you Owen.
Owen! That's right.
- You Owen!
- Me Owen!
- You Owen.
You were a monkey.
That explains so much.
Like how I have no human relatives.
And how I always think of you as a god.
Yep. Monkeys are capable of many things.
Too bad they aren't better at solving crimes.
I think I just figured it out.
I think I just solved both cases.
If you're right, then I'll take back what I said about monkeys not being good at solving crimes.
My partner needs to ask you some questions, Chief.
If you don't cooperate with us, ma'am, We're gonna have to take you down to the station for questioning.
Don't you get it, Briggs?
That's not Chief.
That's not Chief one bit.
That's a baboon.
I won 10 large at the track, monkey.
Be back tomorrow before post time.
- Crap.
What's this money doing at your desk?
Okay, you got me.
I dress up this baboon to fill in for me when I go to the track.
It's an old chief surgeon's trick.
I've been doing it for 15 years.
Your days of monkeying around are over.
Yeah. It's gonna be a real hard day's night for you.
Let it be.
A baboon is so strong, they could tear a man's head clean off his body.
Which is exactly what he's been doing... for 15 years.
Isn't that right, fella?
And there's your confession.
You're in big trouble.
Is replacing yourself at work with a monkey a crime?
In Iraq, yes.
But not here, so...
Actually, I guess you're not in trouble.
How did you figure it out?
Sherlock Holmes once said,
"When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, is most likely a monkey."
It takes a baboon to know a baboon.
Sure does, partner. It sure does.
- Owen, no.
It's just a siren! - Aah! - Aah!
Aah! - Really?
! Really? !
- Heel! - Aah! Aah!
- Release! Release, buddy!
No, bad Owen!
I'm looking for the call room.
Down that hall, hang a right.
Mozart.
29th symphony.
Who's conducting?
Dr. Hamza. It's brain surgery.
In c minor.
Still, give me Dean Martin every time.
Thank you for the directions.
So, everything that you'll need to get you through the next few hours...
A survival kit. Thank you.
Saltine crackers, fruity lip balm.
Who are you calling a fruity lip balm?
Sour candies to absorb the toxicity.
Oh, Gatorade?
Sudoku?
Our kids are almost identical. See?
Great minds think alike, huh?
Guess you don't need me at all.
No, sweetheart.
You are exactly what I need.
Thank you for this.
Onwards to chemo.
If you're looking for the call room, you already passed it.
Well, Charlie Harris.
How'd you know?
Oh, same old Bishop.
Brilliant with a scalpel, lousy with directions.
Well, some things never change, like your handwriting.
Still chicken scratches.
That's what makes me so popular with the staff.
So, I guess the rumors about you joining us are true, then?
Yeah, after training in L.A.
Got tired of bleach-blond nurses and gunshot wounds, huh?
- Never a dull moment.
- No, not with you around.
Buckle up...
Medics are coming in hot with two cirque performers who just fell 20 feet.
Illyana!
Uh, Jeremy Bishop.
Zach Miller.
He fell off a trapeze?
Kind of fitting for your first day.
I'm more of a high wire myself.
Okay, on three.
All right, what's your name?
But you have to help her.
His aerial partner's a minute out.
Cirque de ciel, huh?
I used to date a girl from the Yorrick Company.
She was a contortionist.
Yeah, you're right...
Some things don't change.
Illyana?
Relax, relax, relax.
- Please, I need to see her.
Calm down for me, Kurt, all right?
You guys got him?
Okay, 1 milligram of ketamine for the pain.
Okay, Kurt.
Hey, hey, Kurt, Kurt, look at me.
Out of the way, please.
I need you to focus, okay?
Can you wiggle your fingers for me?
Now your toes.
Okay, I need to reduce this hip.
All right, I'll stabilize.
Hey, bear with me, buddy.
That should give you enough torque.
Okay, relax.
Relax your leg.
Relax your leg. Okay.
Kurt, I'm gonna be putting your hip back in place.
You're gonna feel some pain, followed by a pop, all right?
One, two, and three.
And like a glove.
You should put on some doctory clothes.
Greatest show on earth, right, Charlie?
Spine's intact, but... she's unresponsive.
I'll have her tested for brain death.
S04E08 Waiting on a Friend
- It's half past already.
We got back late from the cottage.
Um, we were supposed to study before rounds.
I know, but it was so hard to leave.
It was beautiful there.
Except for the mosquitoes.
They were huge!
You should have seen the size of them.
They were like vampire bats.
And for whatever reason, they were only biting me.
You should see my back.
I'm covered in bites.
I can't stop scratching.
Except some of them, I can't really reach 'cause they're in the middle of my back.
Would you mind rubbing this bite stuff on me?
- I'm a doctor.
- So am I!
So why are we yelling? !
I want to be with her.
I'm sorry, that's - that's not possible.
[Inhales sharply but I...
It's... it's not fair that she's alone.
Well, I'm...
I'm gonna make sure you have a chance to say a proper goodbye, all right?
I just need you to lift up your arm for me.
Kurt, did you know that Illyana had agreed to be an organ donor?
We signed our cards together.
Okay, well, of course, we're gonna need a final consent if there are any family members.
There aren't.
I'm her only family.
Well, Illyana is gonna be able to help more people today than she ever could have imagined.
Um...
Illyana is a match for a patient waiting for a kidney transplant.
That patient's fiance wanted to donate his, but they weren't a match.
But Illyana is?
Yeah, it's... it's actually...
It's even better than that.
See, the, um...
The patient's fiance has agreed to... to give his kidney to someone else, and that patient's donor partner has also consented.
We call all of this a domino transplant.
Basically...
Four people are gonna have a second shot at life today, and three people are willing to put their lives on the line... all because of Illyana.
Seriously, are you...
Are you hearing this?
Okay, I'm...
So why don't you get some rest, okay?

- Shahir.
- Hm?
Second aerial performer...
Female, 26, brain death.
She's on life support.
That's awful, Alex.
Who's O-neg with a 6 antigen match.
Shahir, she's the perfect donor for Terry Brown.
You're talking about the domino transplant?
When's the last time you saved four lives in a single day?
We'll need to organize our surgeries so the wait time for each recipient is as soon as possible.
They'll need to be off of dialysis and ready to go as soon as their organs arrive.
We'll also need a team to confirm that the recipients are prepped and in the O.R. By the time their kidneys arrive.
This is Keith.
He's our last recipient.
But he's in severe renal failure and can't travel to Hope Zion, so we will coordinate with St. Donald's to deliver his kidney.
This is all hands on deck.
I'm gonna bring in the junior residents.
Williams and Mirani will keep things moving.
We'll get Sekara to be our gopher for the day.
The most important thing to remember is, we've got one shot at this.
Seven surgeries.
Four harvest and three transplants in the next few hours before the final kidney goes to St. Donald's children's hospital.
If something goes wrong with one...
And the dominoes stop falling, so no screw-ups.
Everyone, Dr. Jeremy Bishop, our newest gen-surg on staff.
- I'm Alex.
You need no introduction.
Charlie's told me a lot about you.
Thank you for diving in.
Some of our junior residents.
Check the board, make sure you know where...
How are the bug bites?
We'll be the first in the city to lead a multi-hospital domino transplant.
Doogie.
Okay, Maggie, take Dev and start the first harvest.
Cassie and Asha, I'll need you to coordinate.
I'll be handling all of the transplants.
Dr. Bishop, want to do something fun today?
Giddyup.
Everybody huddle in. Come on.
"Domino" on three.
Domino!
Whoo!
Dr. Kowalski, phone call on line 1.
Dr. Kowalski, line 1.
What year is it?
The magazine.
Uh, 2003.
Why would we want to read articles from so many years ago?
You know, we're cancer patients, not historians.
Josh Lewis, professor of 18th-century poetry.
Or, well, I was until...
Has the, uh, has the nurse been in yet?
It's hurry up and wait.
Well, they have to test our blood first, so...
Yeah, make sure it's okay to poison it.
Yeah, the irony's not lost on me.
But, then, nothing about this place makes any sense.
I mean, I know...
let's get all the sick people, we'll put them in one place, and then have them treated by some semi-socialized beaker head with a God complex.
Sorry. Didn't catch your name.
But most people around here call me Dr. Kinney.
Dr. Kinney.
What's the news, Dawson?
You're good to go.
Let's get you started on the docetaxel.
Yum, yum.
I'm a doctor, too.
Doctor of old poems.
You writing a book?
Thought I might have at least one great novel in me.
Although, now it turns out it might have to be a novella.
Or it might just be, you know, a professional hazard.
Teaching all that great literature, making me think I can do it, too.
Speaking of professional hazards...
Doctor becomes a patient, huh?
You're next up, Josh.
You guys need anything, I'm your gal today.
Thank you, Dawson.
You know, it must be hard, knowing all the facts, to still believe you can actually beat this.
I'm putting both of you under at the same time.
No food, no drinks, so finish up your beers, boys.
You ready to get off dialysis?
Hell yeah, he's ready.
We got a wedding to plan.
So, we got transport on standby to take your kidney to St. Donald's.
Dr. Reid will be with you shortly.
You ready, Erin?
My twins turn 7 next week.
I've been on dialysis since they were 4 years old.
So yeah.
It's been a long road.
We're just waiting for your donor.
Larry's not big on cellphones.
All he's got is this old flip, and the battery's always dead.
Well, time is of the essence, Emma.
He can't just disappear like this.
He'll be here, honey.
Larry doesn't have time for a lot of people, but his big sister's one of them.
Nobody can help an old guy with a chair, huh?
Must've passed a dozen orderlies schlepping this damn thing.
You'd think one of them would have lifted their finger before Liz Taylor here.
Got your chair.
They found a donor.
I'm getting my kidney.
The right donor came in to trigger the domino chain.
It is our lucky break.
I wasn't expecting this today.
Well, yes, I know.
This is all coming very fast.
But we need to move now.
We'll get you into surgery shortly.
But, uh...
I was just reading this thing online.
A guy gave his kidney, and... and, um...
He developed an unexplainable appetite for pumpkin pie.
Wouldn't eat anything else...
Just pumpkin pie, pumpkin pie, day after day.
I hate pumpkin pie.
Are you seriously talking about pie right now?
I just need time to process this, Emma.
Dr. Reid, Maggie sent me down.
Something wrong, Dr. Reid?
Just try to relax.
Excuse me.
It's the cadaveric donor.
We lost the right kidney.
How bad is it, Maggie?
Right kidney's lost blood supply.
It's a goner.
Left one is hypoplastic.
So, we are looking at a small kidney with a crazy arterial network.
Might be too many to anastomose.
Well, Terry's prepped.
They haven't opened him up yet.
I promised four patients they were getting off dialysis today.
That is still the plan.
Okay, we will cut a piece of her aorta, use it to make an arterial cuff around the renal arteries, and then we'll have one in anastomosis instead of three.
Go get ready for the next harvest, please.
Mm-hmm.
Somebody page Dr. Bishop.
All right, ureter is free.
Just the artery cuff to go.
So, the weather's great in L.A. why'd you come back?
I tried an emergency spinal corpectomy on a 15-year-old car crash victim.
Did they die?
No, I saved her life.
And I still got sued anyway.
That is rough.
They had more lawyers on staff than doctors.
I wasn't getting any better...
Just safer.
From everything I've heard about you, caution isn't really your thing.
The way you're working those scissors, I'd say it's not yours, either.
Got it.
Start perfusion and get it ready for transplant.
Kristine.
Have you, um, seen a, uh...
Uh, yeah.
I've seen her.
I've been hearing her all day, too.
I've been trying to talk to her.
No, she doesn't want to talk.
I don't think she wants any help at all.
Okay, well, what does she want?
Uh, well, what do you know about her?
She's a trapeze artist.
Her and her partner took a bad fall.
He managed to pull through, but she's having her... harvested as we speak.
Ohhh.
I-I think I actually know the song.
"My pigeon home," it's called.
It's a lullaby.
- Lullaby?
So she's trying to put us to sleep.
Not working.
Well, it's a song about reuniting.
I think she might be trying to convince someone to join her.
When we met, I was the water boy for my high school basketball team, and I got stuffed in a locker after practice.
Did Dan save you?
I was in the one next to him.
Sounds romantic.
Oh, it was.
Took three hours till the janitor found us.
What were you screaming, again?
"My legs...
I can't feel my legs."
Sounds hilarious.
We knew if we could make it through high school together, we could make it through anything.
So far, we have.
Time to go in.
Don't tell me you don't know the story of Abelard and Heloise.
No, but I have a funny feeling you're about to tell me.
12th century, Paris.
Heloise is this whip-smart student who wants the answer to human existence.
Well, that was her first mistake.
So she goes to study with Pierre Abelard, who's the greatest scholar in France at the time...
About 20 years her senior.
Nothing wrong with that.
Well, it was for her Uncle Fulbert.
He found out about their affair, beat the living crap out of Abelard.
The lovers were banished to live apart forever.
They corresponded by love letters for the rest of their lives.
Do you ever stop talking?
When I'm sleeping, I guess.
Well, then, night-night, professor.
You want one?
Not unless there's weed in them.
Which part of "I'm a poetry professor"
didn't you understand?
Well, then, what the Heloise are you waiting for?
Pass me a pot cookie.
Mmm!
Pali.
I wanted to give this to her.
Or to him...
whoever's donating to Erin.
The donors are all anonymous.
I can't give you a name.
I-I know, but the girls made me promise that I would give it to the person that helped their mommy get better.
I will see what I can do.
You don't know what it's like sitting there helpless while your best friend just gets sicker and sicker.
Of course you know what it's like.
You're a doctor.
So you get why it's so important to me that that gets to Erin's donor?
Uh, yeah, just...
I thought I was ready, but I'm not.
I only came in today to drop off my sister's chair.
Okay, I know that all of this has been sprung on you, and you're probably incredibly overwhelmed, but...
All due respect, you have no idea what I'm going through.
I made a decision.
I'm just asking you to please respect that and leave me the hell alone.
Don't let him leave the building.
- Berger is still in the building.
That was Zach.
He spotted him pacing by the coffee kiosk.
Which means he's waffling.
Yes, which also means we have until he gets to the bottom of his latte to get him back on board.
Hey, Larry.
My name's Dr. Bishop.
It's my first day here.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just hear me out...
I just moved back here from L.A.
I was there training under this Dr. Pearlman.
Amazing surgeon.
Also... a very pious man.
And he taught me a lot of things.
Including this Hebrew phrase... "tikkun olam."
It's from the talmud.
It means "repairing the world."
Says all of humanity has a shared responsibility to heal and transform the world.
Dr. Pearlman, he'd remind us about "tikkun olam"
before every surgery we did.
Larry, I think you have a chance to heal the world today in the simplest, most pure kind of way.
And I know you're scared.
I really do.
I swear.
But I think it's something worth considering.
And I don't think you'd still be here if you didn't think so, too.
My mind's made up.
So, there's these, um...
Um, you know...
Double doors... the kind that open in the center, and, um...
But one of the hinges was broken, so... they...
they kept that locked.
But he didn't know that.
So, anyway, you know, he's finally ready, and he's got, you know, his tray of cheese, you know, it's just right.
And he's carrying it like it's, you know, the most precious thing in the entire world.
And then bam!
His nose goes into the glass, tray goes everywhere.
There's, like, honey all over his beard.
I've come unstuck.
Whoopsie.
Should you be doing this?
Because I'm a...
What'd you say?
A beaker head with a God complex?
'Cause you're higher than a lab monkey.
What is going on here?
Um...
Josh just popped his I.V.
I got it back in.
No, you can't do that.
I'm sorry, but this isn't your charge, Dr. Kinney.
The hell it isn't.
Not in here, you're not.
Then what am I?
If I'm not a surgeon, well, what am I?
A dead duck.
I didn't...
That's what you implied.
In here, you're just my patient.
So, what are my chances of surviving this?
I have a reoccurrence of stage 3 metastatic breast cancer, so what are the odds I'll be here...
By Christmas?
You stay out of this.
As your patient, Dawson, I am asking.
I do...
I don't feel comfortable answering that.
Of course you don't.
I didn't mean to be...
You're all good now, Josh.
I'll be back in a bit to check on you both.
Where did you two meet?
At auditions for cirque.
Two total misfits.
Her parents, Russian immigrants, kicked her out of the house when she was 14.
Mine... hardly even noticed I was gone.
Yeah, I guess when you meet someone like that... who gets you, quirks and all... nothing else really matters, right?
Dr. Harris?
Time of death... 3:13 P.M.
Kurt?
Let's get him back to his room.
I pushed him too hard.
He's never been very good with surprises.
When we were kids, I used to jump out behind corners, and one time...
She popped out, and I hit her square in the mouth.
15 stitches.
I told you he'd come 'round.
I've been scared my whole life.
You've always been this golden child...
Good grades...
Good friends.
We'll give you two some privacy.
I've always been this neurotic mess.
Everyone thought it was a joke when I said I would donate.
But you stood up for me.
We're in a good place, Emma.
I don't want it to stop.
It won't.
That is never gonna change.
Ohhh, boy.
Uh, hey, Alex, I need you to come take a look at this.
A frozen kidney.
Larry put us behind schedule.
It must have been too close to the ice for too long.
Even if we thaw that, we've got little chance of getting it to perfuse.
We've come too far to turn back now.
So, what do you want to do?
Get me 10 bags of warm saline.
And a blowtorch.
Kidding!
Hold the blowtorch.
All right, then.
That freezing didn't do us any favors, but the warm saline flush... It looked good.
You think it'll live?
It has to.
Suturing the renal vein.
Renal vein and artery are anastomose.
Moment of truth.
Let's release those clamps and pray that it takes.
Oh, come on.
Let's go.
We got good perfusion.
Yoooo!
Hey, do you mind doing the ureter anastomosis?
I have to go check in on Larry, make sure he's all right.
Thanks, Bishop.
How did it go?
He should be waking up now.
Heart rate's skyrocketing.
He could be having a stroke.
Page shahir.
Let's get him up to imaging... now.
Good catch, Alex.
It was a stroke.
He's coning.
The swelling from the epidural bleed is pressing on his brain stem.
That should relieve the pressure.
Alex, it's okay.
I've done plenty of these.
Turn up the music, please.
My daughter, Molly, is, um...
studying psychology at Queens.
She wants to be a couples counselor, of all things.
I haven't told her yet...
That it's back.
Toughest thing in the world...
Watching your kid trying to be brave...
No matter how old they are.
Especially when you know the real truth.
Yeah, I'd like to apologize for that.
Then I say we - we double down on this... "Stranger on a train" vibe we got going here.
Let's tell each other one thing that we've never told another living soul.
Yeah?
Who goes first?
You want to rock, paper, scissors?
Oh, careful.
You're gonna pull out your I.V. again.
I don't want to do this again.
I don't want to sit here, getting sicker and sicker.
I want to get on a plane.
I want to fly away.
Well, I want to come with you.
If looks could kill, I'd be the ghost right now.
Well, look at it this way.
What would you be capable of if somebody tried to keep Alex away from you?
So, how do we help her if she won't talk to us?
You know, maybe he doesn't see her, maybe he doesn't hear her, but if he feels her, if he senses that she's here...
Then what?
He won't move on, either?
He won't get better?
That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?
I'm just saying, it's not very scientific.
Illyana, you need to talk to us.
He needs to be with me.
It was your time.
It's not his.
You need to accept that.
He won't make it without me.
He's gonna have to try.
I won't go without him.
Illyana, what are you doing?
I love him too much.
His heart rate's through the roof.
You need to go now!
He's got a petechial rash.
We need to get him to radiology right now.
Could be a fat embolus in his lungs.
Bone marrow may have seeped out of the break and migrated.
- Can you fix him?
Call the code.
We need a crash cart.
Look, Charlie.
Code blue, E.T. wing 203.
Kurt never had a chance.
I'm really not in the mood to see the bright side.
People who love each other that much belong together, even in death.
I'm not buying that.
Maddie.
It was 4:00 in the afternoon.
Not even happy hour.
This guy's all over the road.
He's coming right at us.
I tried to get out of the way, but there wasn't enough time.
We didn't...
we didn't have enough time.
My little girl.
I wanted to die... so I could be with her.
When I woke up in the hospital...
But there were all these other spirits that only I could see.
There's still so much I'm trying to figure out about this...
This thing we have.
Well, maybe we could help each other, you know?
Figure this thing out together.
I'd like that, Charlie.
Last ones.
Yeah, model patients.
Transplants went off without a hitch.
Pali, your kidney is taking a little trip to close out the domino.
It's going to somebody who desperately needs it.
You were badass, Alex.
Yeah, she's not wrong.
All right, girls.
On to recovery ice cream.
Ahh!
So, he's gonna make a full recovery.
Thank God.
One more transport to go, Alex, and you've pulled it off.
Not me... all of us.
Nice ride.
Exhausting, but, um... eventful.
I met a boy.
At chemo?
And he's a poet.
And he asked to come to Paris with me because he wants to show me where Abelard and Heloise are buried.
And I said "yes."
You just started chemo.
I know, but I'm...
I'm thinking that I just have to fight this in a different way for a while.
I'm sorry, but this is insane.
Actually, I think this is the sanest thing I have done in a long time.
You're flying off to Paris with a poet that you met a few hours ago.
Well, when you put it like that...
Instead of prolonging your life...
I don't want to prolong my life.
I want to live it.
Like I just got run over.
I wanted to, um...
I wrote you something.
Oh, it's a... - Limerick, yeah. - Yeah.
It was the only rhyme scheme I could remember, and I'm half-Irish, so...
"A terminal lass from Kilbride was befuddled by fear and by pride."
"Till she heard a sweet man say he'd come with her partway.
So she kissed him, she smiled, and she cried."
Thank you, doctor.
How does it end?
The story?
- Heloise.
Does she find the real meaning of life?
Oh, she does.
Oh, yeah?
The love she found with Abelard...
That was the meaning of human existence.
Hey. What's going on?
You ready?
Look, I get it, Greg is your Jacob, but we all know you're going to end up with Edward.
Because you're Bella.
What is that reference?
It's on the tip of my tongue.
Twilight.
Twilight, yes.
It's only the greatest love story
- since Shakespeare... In Love. - Right.
Yeah.
Right, yeah, okay.
What are you talking about again?
You spent Thanksgiving with Greg, and that was not part of our plan.
You need to be with Josh.
If not for you, then for me.
- I need this.
My marriage is like The Walking Dead, okay?
We are all just trying to get out alive.
You and Josh, your love story... it gives me hope.

We're gonna go to a movie as friends.
It's like he's a stalker.
No one likes a stalker.
The eagle and the bitch have landed.
Let me see. Let me see.
Um, Joshy, do you need, um, glasses?
Because the door is right over there.
Oh. My bad, babe.
Okay, well... I hope they like the rice cooker I got them.
Everyone likes rice, right?
It's a very versatile grain.
Are you crazy?

- Forget the gift.
Forget about the gift.
I am just trying to snap you back into reality, because now that Josh and Valencia are living together, you are not gonna have any more alone time with him.
I just want him to be happy.
Oh, my gosh, Joshy, I'm so glad we finally moved in together.
It's the beginning of our happily ever after.
Yes, it's cool.
Plus, we'll be close to...
I was going to say Taco Bell.
There's only one thing missing.
The salsa?
You just ask for it.
No, furniture, Joshy.
I mean, we don't even have a dining room table.
But we'll get one.
Let's burn sage.
Shoot, I forgot to get that.
Joshy, I needed that sage to cleanse the house of evil spirits.
Ghosts are obsessed with me.
I'll get it right now.
Ugh, I hate her.
She's worse than all the Kardashians combined.
Except for Caitlyn, who is a national hero.
I'm just gonna call Josh and see if it's cool that I come over.
You came up with that way too quickly.
Oh, he pressed "ignore""
Oh... oh... that doesn't feel good.
It's fine, it's fine.
I get it, I'm busy, too!
I won't even think about it.
I don't want to feel this way.
I reject this feeling.
I respectfully decline this feeling.
Hey, here she is!
Here's my MVP.
You ready to kick butt at that meeting?
Calvin Young is the most important potential client we have ever had.
I mean, he is.
I mean, landing him would make us West Covina's premiere law firm.
- Oh. - Are you okay?
I mean, you look a little peaked.
Never felt better. Uh-huh.
I definitely won't press ignore... on this case.
"Mr. Young, I know that you have your choice of law firms
"to represent you in this matter
"of Josh moving into a new apartment with his hot girlfriend... " No!
I typed that?
_
Well, then, why do I have you in the office?
Huh? Gotcha there, bottle.
And here's a health messages from TV's favorite doctor.
Do you know the signs and symptoms of the dreaded panic attack?
Whole firm is counting on you.
Okay, I'm coming.
Scott, I am asking you to drive carpool for one day.
I do it every day.
Oh... fine.
Fine, okay, whatever, I gotta go.
It's nice to... feel appreciated.
Your perfume is delightful.
I rubbed a magazine on myself this morning.
Well, it smells like a cherub dancing in the morning dew.
I'm Calvin Young.
Paula Proctor.
Welcome to Whitefeather.
Are we, by chance, going to the same meeting?
Calvin Young.
Hi, Karen, the case assistant.
Please excuse my handshake.
I have naturally damp hands.
It's a medical condition.
I am in some studies.
Shall we be seated?
- May I get you some coffee, Mr. Young? - Yes.
Uh, French press, if you have it.
French press.
Mr. Young, we are so excited to have this opportunity to bring you into the Whitefeather family.
'Cause that's what we are.
A family that can help you acquire the industrial acreage you're looking for.
Well, I am pleased to be here, Darryl.
Well, we are determined to show you everything that we're capable of.
And to do that... I can think of no one else but our closer.
Um, why don't you take it away, there, Rebecca?
Would you please take it away?
Welcome, Calvin.
Oh, my God, your teeth are blue.
Have you been drinking the water from the toilet?
Must've been from my pen cup.
Welcome... to Joshfeather.
White... feather.
Oh, God.
What happened to you in there?
That's not the Rebecca I know.
I mean, something is wrong.
Karen said that she smells vodka on you.
Vodka doesn't smell.
Listen, Darryl, I know I didn't bring my "A" game...
I think you need to go home.
Wait, are you taking me off the case?
Okay, you're not off the case.
But go home and work on the presentation.
And then, when you come back on Monday, I want you to be the happy Rebecca that we all know and love.
Such a good tip.
So helpful.
"Be happy."
Hey, are you okay?
I got back with Calvin's fancy coffee and Darryl said you weren't feeling well and you went home.
Yeah. Yeah, my blood sugar was a little low, so I decided to just come home and really focus on the presentation all weekend.
Hey, are you sure you're cool to do the Calvin dinner without me?
Okay. Uh, I gotta hop off.
I'm really working hard here.
It's important to deal with one's feelings head-on, because repressed feelings lead to depression.
What do you know?
Repression equals depression.
That is...

I'm tired, too.

I'm depressed, too.
Man... the French really know how to make depression look sexy.

There is nothing sexy about depression, Rebecca.
Listen, you better get your act together, young lady, or you're gonna run this new life off in the ditch.
How did you get in here?
Well, your depressed mind invited me in.
And by the way, this place is a dump.
You ever think about maybe hanging a little art in here or something, anything?
Maybe a mural?
Are you sure this is the dining table she wants?
- I want to surprise her.
- Surprise her?
With furniture?
She's very picky, dude.
Yeah, yesterday you got in trouble because you bought the wrong kind of sage.
You bought the kind you put in food, not the kind you scare ghosts away with.
Valencia's intense, bro.
As sexy as she is, she's intense.
She has final approval over all your clothing.
Yeah, you know... yes.
I really miss your cargo's.
We all do.
Guys, I'm committed to this relationship.
I want to contribute.
You know? She's done everything.
She picked out the apartment, she booked the moving trucks.
We're supposed to be a team and I want to do something for her.
So we gonna do this or what?
Yes. Yes, we are going to do this.
Guys, we can bang this out.
According to this, it is a very simple - 72-step process. - 72-step process.
Oh, hell no.
Okay. We're not doing that.
We lost Hector.
Oh, my God, you're still here.
Tell it to me straight.
Am I schizophrenic?
I'm just in your imagination.
I mean, let's face it:
you do have a very active imagination.
One minute, you're walking down the street, the next minute, you're in a big musical.
Although, I gotta say,
I did love the pretzel.
You did a good job on that one.
Aw, it's a shoelace tip.
Ugh, that's gross.
Oh, my God, you're looking for prescription meds in a drawer?
Listen, when I moved here, I thought I was okay, so I dumped them all my meds and now, you know, I realize that I'm not okay.
I mean, look at me, I'm falling apart here.
This is really bad.
So if I can just get my old prescription meds back, I'll be okay.
Uh, here's a thought.
Anxiety, depression... how about you see a doctor first?
I'll go do that.
Ten steps ahead of you.
Thank you so much for seeing me on such short notice,
Dr. Akopian.
What can I help you with?
I'm not myself right now.
We're always ourselves, Rebecca.
Right. Yeah.
No, so I don't feel like myself.
This isn't usually how I am.
Like, I'm normally very organized and focused.
Sounds like you're feeling out of control.
Let's delve into your childhood.
Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.
Okay, so, I've been through the therapy wringer,
I've rehashed my childhood a ton.
And I don't really want to do it again.
Like, for me and for you, frankly, I don't want to put that on you.
So here's what I need.
I need these.
Those are the meds I was on in New York.
Oh, my God.
How did your body react to all this medication?
You must not have been able to feel a thing.
Numb as they come.
So... scribble scribble on your pizzle pad.
Rebecca, your doctor in New York is a quack.
He gave you a Band-Aid, not a cure.
My method would be to do some digging and figure out what's really going on inside your mind.
And then we can discuss the appropriate medications.
So that's great, but I need to be better by Monday.
It's a work thing, so... We doing this?
Okay, well, you know what?
You'll be hearing from me on Yelp.
Um, where is your rest room?
Say, what time is your husband joining us?
He bailed at the last minute.
He has rehearsal for his singing group.
And that's more important than this?
He does what he wants to do, I don't care.
I do what I want to do, he doesn't care.
It's basically the storybook romance I dreamed of as a little girl.
Aw, you see? You guys get each other.
That's so cool.
How are my eyebrows?
Don't care.
They can be wonky.
Few people know this, but bald eagles aren't bald at all.
You see, the name actually derives from a word meaning "white headed."
And being a "white feather," well, I've always felt very connected to our national bird.
Actually, it's my spirit animal.
May I just say this is an adorable red?
Unconventionally alluring, with the soul of a poet.
I got it at the gas station, but in the ten-dollar bin.
In the future, you really should try some of the Arizona wines.
Blend those with a smooth Camembert... Mmm! Heaven.
Oh, I am imagining that.
Mmm... Camembert.
It's fun to say.
You tell me everything about you, - don't skip a thing, go. - Okay.
I was born in Irvine, California.
Um, my favorite color is green...
- Not you. - Oh.
You know what? Calvin, you're the guest, so you should go first. Go ahead.
Okay, well, um, I was born in Prescott, but I knew a small town wasn't for me, so I moved to the big city.
- Phoenix?
- Tucson.
Yeah, and I, uh, met my lovely wife.
Ten years of bliss... and then she died.
It was a, uh, short and tragic illness.
The last thing she said was...
"Calvin, "be happy.
"Take life and... and grab it."
You should take whatever you want.
Just take and grab.
I'm gonna roll.
Okay, let's see... pink pill with the number 55 on it...
ADD medication.
I've always wanted to take this.
Do-do I really need to tell you don't take a pill you found on the bathroom floor next to the toilet?
Here me out, Dr. Phil.
It improves focus and promotes goal-directed behavior.
That's exactly the mojo that I need.
Rebecca, I know what it says, and I know what you need.
You need to focus on this:
Josh could find you if he wanted to.
You have made yourself really easy to find.
You have been rejected.
Rejected.
He doesn't want you.
Deal with it.
No. I'm not gonna listen to you.
You talk silly.
Oh, what's that, little pill?
"Eat me, Rebecca"?
Well, I think I will.
Pills don't talk.
She took it.
Let's get to work.
All right, let's see this presentation...
What is Karen doing?
She put two spaces after a period.
What is this, 1997?
Well, those have to go.
Okay! Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's kicking in right now.
And what are these, Oxford commas?
Well, those have to go, too.
I just gotta edit this whole thing before I even start.
I would love to show you around tomorrow morning.
There's, um, the Chino Hills State Park, the Azusa Fish Canyon Falls.
May I be so bold as to inquire your availability and whereabouts tomorrow afternoon?
Do you like jazz?
Hot jazz?
Is there any other kind?
There's a small place in South Pasadena.
My friends who blow horn say it's the best little jazz boîte in town.
Would you and your husband like to join me for some smooth licks?
- I would. - Mmm.
Uh, but he's, uh, busy.
He's... with rehearsal for his singing group.
And, you know, he's not much of a licker.
What time do you want to pick me up?
You're gonna be so excited!
Christmas lights!
So, may I ask who's crazy now?
I never said you were crazy.
That's a derogatory term and I don't think it really applies to you.
Where were you in my senior gender studies class?
We'll talk about that later.
For now, it's time to get down to business.
But you know, before I get down to business, I'm just gonna see what my friends are up to.
Instagram, oh!
Valencia posted a lovely picture of them in their new bedroom.
It says ♪Christened...
How nice.
Oh, nice to hear.
How's that working for you?
I don't understand your question.
But you know what, I'm starting to realize that maybe that pill was not what I needed.
Oh, there's a shocker.
Just spare me.
Spare me the wisecracks.
You got any downers?
Is this enough of a downer for you?
I could just melt into the chair, like, like a butter lady.
No, that's bad.
Because I can't get work done right now.
It's the most fantastic-iest idea.
That's not a real word.
Seriously, seriously, seriously.
Seriously, are you busy right now?
Honey, hi.
Yeah, I-I'll be home in, like, an hour, tops.
Thanks, Booboo.
Valencia's so mad at me.
We've been here all night, and I haven't even finished sorting the screws.
Josh, there's still time to bail.
On the table, I mean.
We were friends with you before we even met this table.
Uh, the truth is none of us really even
like the current table.
I hate this table.
We don't like, um, this table.
And you're going to ruin your life if you stick with this table.
Bros before... tables.
I think it's a nice thing you're doing.
Nicest thing I ever did for a girl was pull out.
She has tandem parking, so after I'm there for a while, I have to pull out.
Which is such a pain, 'cause it feels so great just to leave it in there.
The worst is when it's alternate side of the street parking, 'cause then I got to park it in back.
I don't even get why there's a spot back there.
It's so tight.
Feels more like an exit.
So then I'm going front, back, front, back... and it's all dirty in the back, so when I move it to the front, then that gets all dirty.
I'm just happy I have a spot at all.
'Cause I used to have to pay.
Well, that was edifying.
This burrito is a symphony.
Dr. Akopian's gonna be so happy to see me.
When I pop up, she's gonna be like,
"Whoa, you're so chill!
I'm gonna give you all the drugs""
Well, I want to check out her bathroom floor and see what else she has lying around. Hmm.
I bet her vacuum cleaner is filled with cool pharmaceuticals.
That's such a good point!
I wonder what she has in there.
Dr. Akopian?
Dr. Akopian, it's me Rebecca Bunch!
I'm really cool and chill now.
Okay, not giving up, not giving up!
Here, Dr. Akopian?
Oh, my God, it's her prescription pad.
Oh, I see it!
Wait, she wouldn't have left it by the window if she didn't, like, want somebody to take it, right?
Yeah, it's like a wizard test.
Wait, wait, what are you doing?
You can't fit through there.
Yeah, yeah, I totally can.
Because look at me... Look how tiny I am.
I'm tiny...
I'm child-size.
I'm a puppy.
I'm a poodle. I'm a shrimp.
Yeah, I'm going.
Okay, yeah, all right.
Oh, no, I think I'm stuck.
Oh, we forgot.
You're small, but you got those British-nanny-sized boobs.
British nanny...
Hello, guv'nor.
Please, sir, may I have some pills?
Ah, your best table, please, sir.
Oh, I don't work here.
Oh, well, this will spot you till you get back on your feet then, huh?
Oh, no, I-I have a job.
Seat the lady, hmm?
Ah, I love jazz.
I mean, the Charlie Brown theme song, come on.
Ah, The Vince Guaraldi Trio.
Though some mistakenly think it's Brubek.
Welcome to Smoky Jazzzz.
My name is Ike.
Our specialty cocktail tonight is called The Chimney.
Mmm, well those sound good.
Uh, two of those, uh, top shelf, and, uh, make those, uh, chilled glasses.
Wow, you have all those fancy cards I see commercials for.
Well, I like perks.

You know I could
- have you both arrested?
Breaking and entering.
First of all,
I only half-entered.
And second of all, as far as the breaking goes, you have no idea of my intent to steal your prescription pad.
But since you were both stoned when you broke in, and not in your right mind...
I'm willing to offer you a deal, Ms. Bunch.
Make an appointment and start to get help and I won't press charges against either of you.
Fine. Yeah. You win.
I will come in here,
I will explore my feelings, do whatever you want.
Now can I have the drugs?
I'm gonna take a nap here for just a... year.
What about your job thingy?
Oh, God, I hope Darryl doesn't fire me.
Can you get my phone?
I think it's in your purse.
I know, I'm just too tired.
Can you get it?
Just put it in my hand?
Just place it inside my hand.
Place it inside.
Yeah, okay, listen, I got something to tell you.
I cannot do the presentation with Calvin on Monday.
Can you tell Darryl for me?
I'm-I'm actually with Calvin, so I could just tell him.
We are at the hotel on East Cameron and he just went out for ice, and I only have a second.
Hotel?
Why are you at a ho...
Is that Anita Baker playing in the background?
Oh, oh, he's coming back.
Uber.
I need an Uber.
Oh, okay.
Actually, no, forget the Uber, it's just around the corner.
I've never been in a hotel room with a couch before.
Uh, all the perks.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
It's like a fantasy... like strawberries and champagne is just gonna magically arrive at the door.
You didn't!
She's gonna love it.
I-I feel so great about this.
She's here. She's here, guys.
Mwah. Okay. Okay.
Left.
Is it a puppy?
Babe, what am I looking at?
It's your new dining room table.
We stayed up all night making it for you.
- That you didn't pick out.
- And I helped.
So, do you like it?
Well... it doesn't match our other things.
It's not exactly what I would've picked out.
Oh, well, I mean, if it's... not something you want, I mean, I guess I...
You could take it apart and give it back?
Josh, you are so smart.
I got to go back to class, you guys, but thank you so much.
Oh, and you all should come over for dinner when we have the right table.
Yeah? Okay. Bye.
She scares me so bad.
Look, Paula,
I know your marriage is crap.
And I get that you're about to have the hottest sex of your life.
Mmm.
Right. So why are you stopping me?
Because it's not real.
It's a Band-Aid.
Remember the other day when you were trying to get me to face my reality, right?
And I didn't get it?
Now I get it.
You're doing the exact same thing.
You need to face your real problem, and your real problem is that your marriage is dead.
And you need to fully feel that, and you need to face it, because this is just a temporary fix.
It's like a pill you found on the bathroom floor.
Who would take a pill they found on the floor?
Look, look, I've spent my whole life numbing myself, okay?
I have spent my whole life escaping to far-off places, and it's only recently, like, now, like, literally this second that I realize, like, I can't do that!
I have to feel my feelings.
It's okay to feel, Paula.
It's been five years since I made love without the TV on.
And ten years since somebody held my hand.
I-I miss my dead wife.
Literally the most entertaining day of my life.
Rebecca, making a speech like that in front of a potential client, that... was brave.
Also a bit foolish.
In most cases, clients would run in the opposite direction.
And I understand if this means you don't want to work with me...
Look, let me finish.
You have the kind of no-nonsense honesty and raw emotional insight that I look for in a commercial real estate lawyer.
You are a wonderful woman,
This weekend has been so special.
But marriage is a precious thing.
If I could hold my wife for one more second...
Oh. Don't make me cry again.
Is this alpaca?
It's so soft.
My dead white wife loved alpaca.
What did you say to Calvin?
He was so impressed, he's not even seeing other people.
I mean, how did you swing that?
I just was honest about... about all the great work you do,
I just made him see what you wanted him to see, that we're a group of kick-ass lawyers and we're a family.
Feel your feelings.
Everyone should feel their feelings.
Everyone should always feel their feelings.
Well, I, for one, am feeling peeved, because this copier...
Cork it, Karen!
But this copier...
Cork it!
Rebecca, I'm very glad you're welcoming the opportunity to work on yourself.
I am so grateful to be here, and I'm excited to face my problems head-on.
I know it's gonna be hard work, but it's work that I am prepared... it's work...
I know I should just... work,
I should make sure this isn't an emergency.
_
You know what, I'm feeling better already, actually.
So I'm-I'm gonna go to this very important thing, but I want to let you know that this is not over.
I'll see you next week.
A rice cooker?
Because Valencia is Mexican and I'm Filipino and rice is a staple in both of our...
Cultures. Yeah. Right.
Uh, oh, sorry it took me forever to return your call from Friday.
Oh, my gosh, you... You're so busy.
Don't even think about it.
Is this a nice table?
It's a perfect table.
That's what I think.
Uh, hey, um, do you want to come over sometime, just check out the new place?
There's not a lot of furniture, so there's plenty of room to slip and slide around in our socks like in Risky Business.
Oh, my God, that sounds amazing.
Just, like, don't tell Valencia, 'cause she thinks it's stupid.
Well, Valencia's stupid.
Sorry. I'm sure she's smart in her own way.
But anyway I have the perfect slippy-slidey socks.
Number 31.
Oh, no. Don't you start with me.
Just keep walking, old man.
Get out of my life.
Oh, my God, uh, Dr. Phil.
- How you doing? - Oh.
I'm s... Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.
You're actually Dr. Phil.
Even Dr. Phil has got to have his boba.
Maybe you should, uh, get help for that.
You guys make a really cute couple.
Oh. That's so funny.
We're not a couple.
That's so funny. He thinks we're a couple.
That's so funny.
We're not a couple.
He thinks we're a couple.
That's so funny, but we're not a couple.
Yeah. G-Good luck to you, buddy.

Previously on "Angie Tribeca"...
- Sergeant Pepper?
- Angie.
- How long have I been out?
- About nine months.
Next you're gonna tell me you're seeing someone else.
Scholls thinks I had the baby with some chick in Canada.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Who's his mother?
Is that really important, who's his mother?
Do people really care who their mom is?
I'm ready to work, Lieutenant.
You just got out of a coma.
Hey, if Tribeca says she's ready, then she's ready.
Or do I have to show you my fist?
I was wondering if I could see the visitors log from when I was in a coma.
Has anyone here heard of the website "MeetNCheat.org"?
Their server's been hacked.
This is all the stolen data from the Meet'N'Cheat hack, names and addresses of all the members on the site.
They're making it look like the LAPD is publishing it.
My name is on the list.
Mayor Joe Perry.
Username...
MayorJoePerry1.
Password... "YesThatMayorJoePerry."
I'd like to introduce you to Special Agent Diane Duran.
So, Mayhem Global hires Duran to hack Meet'N'Cheat.
She draws us in.
Then she hacks us from the inside.
Sergeant Pepper. I know he's still alive.
If you're serious about finding Pepper, he'll meet you here.
I found out that the biggest criminal is not out on the streets.
He's in the mayor's office.
Mayor Perry?
Voter fraud, racketeering, money laundering, racketeering fraud, voter laundering.
The list goes on and on.
What about Mayhem Global?
I am Mayhem Global.
There's one number programmed into this phone.
When you're ready to be part of the revolution, call it.
What's the point of any of this?
We have evidence, a confession, and the bad guy doesn't spend one night in jail?
- That's the system, Tribeca.
- The system sucks.
Pieced it all together?
Currently on "Angie Tribeca"...
You're just perfect.
We're gonna take such good care of you.
The Freezematic 15,000.
Once this bad boy gets going, it's gonna chill your milk, preserve your meat, call your sister, cure hepatitis.
Yep. You're looking at 28 cubic feet of self-regulated, vacuum-sealed cold.
That's a separate produce crisper with an independent temperature control.
Check out this freezer.
A dead body fro...
That's not supposed to be there.
But I just plugged it in, and it's already ice-cold.
That's pretty good.
Tell us what happened.
Well, growing up, I always thought I'd be a pro football player, but I got a bum knee, so went into the family business... real estate.
Market takes a tumble, here I am.
How about what happened today.
Got up about 4:30, hit the snooze button... just the one time... got up, showered.
At work, sir.
What happened at work?
Let's see.
I got to where I pick up the truck for deliveries.
I pull into the parking structure.
Level "A" is full, Level "B" is full.
Level "C", there was a compact spot, but I made it work.
What's the name of the company you work for?
Golden Gate Fridge.
I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.
Councilman Dreyfuss is airing out all of Mayor Perry's dirty laundry.
Is this who you want leading your city for another four years?
He actually has some good points.
It's too bad the old guy doesn't have a shot.
He'd need a miracle to win.
And what are the odds of two miracles in one month?
So, where are we on the body in the fridge?
We're waiting on Scholls for an I.D. and a cause of death.
I talked to someone at the refrigerator company.
They're gonna send someone out to talk to us between the hours of 4:00 and 8:00.
Wow, that's a huge window.
No appointments?
You can get a specific time, but you have to wait like three weeks.
Okay, so I'll have Tanner wait around for the fridge guy.
You guys check in with Scholls and see if she has a name for us.
Will do, Lieutenant.
So, I tried calling you this weekend.
Yeah, I dropped my phone in the toilet.
Total write-off.
And then I immediately got this new one with a different number.
But we're still on for bowling tonight.
Yeah, actually, I can't.
I dropped my bowling ball in the toilet.
And then I immediately got this one.
But the guy told me to wait a couple days until the marble settles.
Ah, Tribeca, Geils.
I want to show you something.
Disgusting, isn't it?
- A cat did that.
How can I help you?
We were wondering if you were able to I.D. the fridge corpse.
Ah, the very cold case, yes.
I want you to see something.
The deceased's name is Charles Michael Bucket, and his fingerprints match exactly those of a sailor who's been missing for three days.
- Navy?
- Worse. Coast Guard.
Dr. Scholls, can you show the detectives what you showed me?
- Is that a whistle?
- In his windpipe.
And something tells me he wasn't born with it.
Although he did die with it.
We think someone shoved a whistle down his throat after a struggle.
You can see the defensive wounds here and here.
Why a whistle?
Someone trying to send a message?
Don't blow whistles?
Someone's telling him not to be a whistle-blower.
But what was he blowing the whistle on?
We examined every other orifice several times but found no evidence.
We'll try and take out the whistle and see if we can pull some DNA.
Meanwhile, we'll go pay a visit to the Coast Guard.
The Commandant's a very busy man, you know.
We appreciate you getting us in, Petty Officer Snick.
Chief Petty Officer Snick, thank you very much.
And I thought you said you were coming at 2:00.
Isn't it 2:00?
It's 1:50, which means I only got a 20-minute lunch break, but whatever.
It's fine. I'll have a candy bar or something.
Sorry, Petty Officer.
We didn't think it was a big deal.
Detectives, Commandant Don Van Zandt.
Come in, detectives.
That'll be all, Snick.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for finding Seaman Bucket.
We are a brotherhood, and when one of our brothers go missing, it hurts the whole Coast Guard family.
If there's anything that I could do to assist in your investigation, don't be afraid to ask.
Well, for starters...
I'm afraid that's all the time that I've got today.
CPO Snick will see you out.
We were really hoping to ask you some questions,
Commandant Don Van Zandt.
I know you were, Detective. I know you were.
You listen here, Popeye.
This is a murder investigation, and we're the murder police.
So start talking.
I think you're outside of your jurisdiction, Detective.
This is an internal matter for the Coast Guard, thus to be handled internally by the Coast Guard with no outside help.
All due respect, Commandant, this base is in L.A. County, so when somebody's killed in L.A., it is very much in our jurisdiction.
CPO Snick will see you out.
We'll see ourselves out.
Okay. It's my one job, but go ahead.
We need base access, we need to interview his shipmates, but the Coast Guard keeps shutting us down at every turn.
Because they know something that they don't want to tell us.
It's a classic case of keeping something secret.
If they want to get into a jurisdictional dick-measuring contest, I'm all for it.
It sounds like fun, and I like my chances.
Go talk to the Melanie Burke at the D.A.'s office and see if she can help us out.
- Lieutenant. - Yep?
As predicted, the refrigerator guy came as soon as I got in the shower.
That's so frustrating.
It's like they know.
So I can either wait till tomorrow at the same time, or I can go to the warehouse in Long Beach and talk to them.
That's a hell of a long drive, but I don't think it can wait.
There's a Dave Buster's right next door.
Tanner!
I'm gonna go with you.
This guy's going to the chair.
As God as my witness, he's gonna fry.
Just backing up a bit, we don't know who did it.
Yeah, but we appreciate your enthusiasm.
Someone showed up to work today.
All right, what do you guys want, huh?
Just tell me what you want, and I'm gonna put it in your little hands.
All right? You want a court order?
You want a subpoena?
You want a grand jury?
I'm gonna get you a grand jury.
We're not quite there yet, Melanie, but good to know we have you in our back pocket.
All right, so hit me. Anything.
Well, I guess we could start by getting subpoenas
- for some of Bucket's shipmates.
How about a search warrant?
Check your inbox. Already there. Did it this morning.
- Can I use your restroom?
- You just did.
- Validate parking?
- I would love to.
Parking.
Got here at 10:21.
It's 11:04 now, so that's... That's... That's 28... 28 minutes.
No, that's like 40 minutes.
Shh. Okay. These are 15-minute increments.
- We'll just pay.
- Please, just give us our ticket back.
Can you just...
'Cause I had it, and now I don't have it.
- Just give it back.
- This one is...
You can stick it together.
Ahh... Oh. They're not lickies.
This is great. Thank you.
Come on, guys! Hurry up!
I told you. I don't know anything about no body in no fridge.
So, no one looks into the refrigerators when you take them off the boat?
Of course. Every product gets quality-controlled.
Nobody thought to raise a red flag when they saw a body in a fridge?
When my guys checked it, there was no body, okay?
My guys know what they're doing.
Lieutenant, I'm gonna need you to look away for this one.
Mr. Sterelli, let me ask you something.
How do you feel about Dave Buster's?
It's the number-one destination for family fun.
- Everybody knows that. - Mm.
How about if I told you I had 5,000 tickets with your name all on them?
Have you had any interaction with the Coast Guard?
They come around sometimes, make sure the shipments get through with no hassles.
What shipments?
They don't tell me nothing, and I don't ask nothing.
Every once in a while, a shipment of appliances comes off through the boat that I'm not allowed to inspect.
They put it in a Coast Guard truck and take it off my hands.
That's all I know.
Anything else, you're gonna have to ask the Coast Guard.
Thank you, Mr. Sterelli.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me!
Excuse me, seamen and women!
We're wondering if anybody has any information on the death of Charlie Bucket.
I got information.
But if you want me to talk, you got to beat me.
The other lady.
Seaman Bucket was my bunk mate.
We were closer than brothers.
I know this is difficult, but can you think of any reason why someone would want to hurt him?
He was a great sailor and really popular, although, the last couple weeks, it did seem like he really had something on his mind.
I'd say to him, "Hey, Charlie. You got something on your mind?"
And he would say, "Huh? What?"
Like he had something on his mind.
You have any idea what happened to his stuff... clothes, footlocker, detailed diary?
Yeah, I did find one detailed diary.
I didn't think anything of it at the time.
You want to take a look at it?
It might help.
"Smash Mouth" is two words.
A Coast Guard truck? This late?
We should go check it out.
We don't have a warrant.
Oh, I think we'll be okay.
I can't wink.
Tanner, hit the siren.
Evening, detectives.
How's about you open the back of that truck and let us have a look-see?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Detective.
I'm on official Coast Guard business, so unless you want to take it up with the President of the United States...
I'll do that.
President Obama, Lieutenant Pritikin Atkins.
Is it okay if we look inside a Coast Guard truck?
- Wait, can I talk to him?
- Oh. He hung up.
Is he buying it?
It's hard to read his face.
What's he doing now?
He's still looking with a suspicious look on his face.
What are you two whispering about?
Ke$ha.
Vice President .45 says open the back of the truck.
Hey, how's it going, eh?
Are we in America?
Canadians?
What in the name of Tim Hortons is going on here?
Mr. President, we have a situation.
I didn't know the Coast Guard deals in the trafficking of illegal immigrants.
There's a lot you don't know, Detective, like how to apply eyeliner or who won Best Picture in 1984.
"Amadeus."
What were you doing with a truckload of Canadians?
Okay, you want to play that game?
Well, we just found your DNA on the whistle inside of Seaman Bucket's throat, so you're going down either way.
If you cooperate, maybe we can get the charges reduced.
I don't have to answer to you. I only answer to one man.
But there is one tiny bit of information you should know.
I have a horrible shellfish allergy.
- Whoa, put down the shrimp!
- Don't do it, man. No.
Put it down.
No. That's no way to go out.
- Nice knowing you, detectives.
- Put the shrimp do...
- Oh, and Angie,
- Sergeant Pepper says hello.
- Don't do it, man!
- Dreyfuss for mayor! - No! No!
We got our murderer, and we didn't have to watch a jury screw it up.
Who wants to see a flick?
This isn't over.
We have to go after Van Zandt.
There's a massive conspiracy going on here.
Officer Snick put a shrimp in his mouth just to protect it.
I don't want to do 3-D. It makes me dizzy.
We cannot trust the Coast Guard to investigate itself.
I'm not gonna stand here and watch this get lost in the shuffle.
Tribeca, the buck has officially been passed.
It's Immigration and JAG Corp's problem now.
I saw it.
Brown stuff. Rocks.
When did it become so hard for the good guys to do any good?
Sometimes I think we'd make more of a difference without the badge.
You've just been so different lately.
I'm still incredibly attracted to you.
But something's changed.
I'm in a bad place, Geils.
You don't want any part of this.
We're doing good, Angie.
We're making a difference.
At the end of the day, you just got to leave the job at the job.
Guess I'm just having a bad year.
Angie, promise me you won't do anything crazy.
Set a course for Dreamland.
I'm not here to arrest you.
Or sleep with you.
Take me to Pepper.
Ahh, ahh, aah! Your feet are freezing!
Okay, I'll take you!
So, what are the Canadians for?
Are you putting together some kind of army?
Voters.
It's right up here on the right.
- Face forward.
- Thanks, Commandant.
I'm done with you.
Here's your chapstick back.
Not until you tell me what the hell you're up to.
You know what I see when I look out this window?
No more bullshit.
You're importing Canadians to vote for Dreyfuss? What is this?
Mayor Perry will not be the next mayor of Los Angeles.
He's gonna win. He's killing Dreyfuss in the polls.
Mayor Perry will not be the next mayor of Los Angeles.
One way or another, he's gonna lose, and there isn't a damn thing you can do abo...
Oh. Really?
I thought that was gonna be a lot harder.
Great. Good news.
Just act normal, and at a certain point, the Commandant will contact you.
I'm really happy you're joining us, Angie.
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...
Whatever happened with you and your ex?
Ex?
Oh, Greg, I'm sorry.
Of course, I forgive you, Joshy.
Love doesn't work out for me, ever.
So you are unhappy.
Yeah. Duh.
Maybe it's time you see what else is in your life, besides Josh Chan.
Oh, my gosh, you have changed my life,
Dr. Dream Ghost Akopian.
You made me see past all of my delusions that were holding me back.
Josh, you don't understand?
You don't see what this has all been about for Rebecca?
Rebecca, are you in love with me?

We get it!
Why do you have all these photos?
Yep, okay, so here's what happened.
I had... have... had feelings for you, indeed, yes.
God, this is awkward, um, I came here to tell you that Valencia...
Valencia and you are staying together.
- No... I-I-I I gathered. - Yeah.
I get it and that makes sense, yeah.
Josh, I'm actually very glad you're here, because, um, I realized some things on my recent trip.
And, um, one of the things I realized is that I need to break my old patterns.
Yes, uh, starting with...
I've been horrible to Valencia, like, really horrible, and I really want to reach out to her.
- I really wouldn't.
- I really think I should.
She really hates your guts.
Understandable, and I will just have to transcend that.
I am trying to break free of anything unhealthy or damaging.
So, um, that starts with, uh, trashing these.
Unless you want them.
Although, um, you know, some of those are great angles that you can't get with a selfie, so, uh...
- Sure, yeah, yes. - Yeah.
Okay, well, there it is.
That's the last of the Josh Chan stuff.
There was stuff?
Well, I guess I should go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, get out.
- Get out of here. - Yeah, yeah.
Bye, Josh.
Can I get another beer?
I'm trying to study.
Studying and drinking at the same time: good decision.
I know, right?
It's extension school.
I-I don't like to tell a lot of people this, but I got into Emory Business School.
It's a pretty good school.
They call it like the Harvard of the South.
I thought the Harvard of the South was Vanderbilt.
No. No. No.
Yeah, so I got into school, and then my dad got sick, so now I'm working my way through school here.
I can't be slinging drinks to losers until I'm like 60 years old.
Oh, boy, look at this.
Just what I need.
I thought you drank at Home Base.
I drink anywhere, but I do my study-drinking here.
Can I pull up a stool next to you, or do you want to... be alone?
I could go home and drink some mouthwash.
Mouthwash, wow.
That's almost as sad as a girl coming to a strange bar by herself.
Sad says the man with an open textbook... next to an open container.
I like this.
Do you want to hang out for a while and insult each other?
Ah, what would your girlfriend think about that?
Um, Heather?
Uh, yeah, no, we're done-zo.
Oh, wow. I had no idea.
Can I get you a drink?
Nothing goes better with a fine lager than a little snark.
Go back to the Heather thing.
Let's-let-let's talk.
Talk is not on the bar menu, but we could ask.
Okay, so, yeah, here's the thing.
Old me would have been totally down for, like, an old-fashioned barb fest, but I've decided recently that I'm trying to change my patterns.
So I'm gonna go.
No, come on. Come on.
I'm a glutton for punishment.
Stay. Let's do this.
We can make bad decisions together.
We could run in traffic.
Boy, she really digs you.
She's in love with someone else, but I figure ten, 11 years of me trying,
I'm a lock.
Okay, what is happening?
Why are you throwing out all this Josh stuff?
I told you, I've gone cold turkey on the Chan.
It's not good for me, and you know that.
D... oh, G... you have to keep the macaroni portrait.
That took two weeks.
No, no, Paula, I'm breaking my old patterns.
Break old pat... I...
What does that even mean?
Did you go to a bumper sticker store?
No, I just realized a lot of things on my trip to New York, while I was in a bumper sticker store.
Okay, but you're right about this, actually, it has a lot of dry goods on it, it actually could be useful for my earthquake kit,
- so I will keep this.
- That's my girl.
But everything else goes in the trash.
- Hmm, hmm. - Oh, come on.
Not Channy bear.
Fine, maybe I'll just put Channy bear on a high shelf in case of a... bear-mergency.
But the rest of this is going, bye.
- Oh, come on... - Bye, letters to Josh.
First drafts, second drafts.
- In the trash.
- That's insanity. - Nope.
Good-bye, Josh thong that I never wo... I don't wear thongs.
Why did I even get this?
You have finally lost it.
You have left the reservation and I-I can't... I'm not...
I can't watch it. I don't care. I don't care.
I'm not supporting this.
Hey... I'm so nervous, aren't you?
That last test...
Was pretty easy, at least for me.
Wow, that's impressive.
You must be smart.
Yeah, well.
I-I don't like to tell people this, but, um...
Oh, you don't have to tell me something you don't like to...
I got into the Harvard of the South.
Emory?
The Harvard of the South is Duke.
No, no.
Emory. Google it.
So, everyone, overall there were some nice efforts, but, uh, some of you, I'm sad to say, fell short.
I'm really not sure what rubric you're using to grade these, but...
Doesn't take much of a rubric to see that you didn't put in much of an effort here.
Oh, well, you know, I work full-time.
My dad is sick.
I work two jobs and my husband is dead.
I am very sorry to hear that, but I... was not involved.
Your next assignment is an essay due Friday.
You can do better, Mr. Serrano.
You got into the Harvard of the South, after all, which you somehow managed to mention on your test.
A multiple choice test.
So, you're busting my balls about an intro class at an extension school?
Cool, yeah. Makes sense.
Look, I don't know you very well, but from where I stand, it seems like you've made the choice not to try or something.
Oh, please, don't you worry about my decisions.
I will decide about my decisions.
Choosing not to try, Greg.
You got into Emory, Greg.
I mean, duh, I could have done better.
I could have gotten an "A" on that test if I'd wanted to.

You're an idiot.
Oh, my God, this is nuts.
Okay, you can't give up on Josh right now.
You are so close.
Paula, he picked Valencia.
Like, in front of my face.
Game has just begun.
Okay, you have antibodies to his saliva.
You have traction.
He-he touched the side of your boob, I saw it.
- Can you get whoever that...
- Yeah, I will get that.
And... just... let's continue the convo later, okay?
And if it's the people across the street from that church, just tell them I don't believe and will never believe.
Hello, everyone in Josh's family.
I haven't seen you since the last book club.
I haven't seen you got engaged.
It feels like I've been waiting seven years for Phillip to propose, because I have.
Let me see the rock.
Oh, my gosh, I mean,
Phillip said he was going for it, but...
He said you were so helpful getting it.
Oh, it was no problem at all.
I helped my client, Moshe, through a very complicated subdivision deal, and he said he could hook me up with non-blood diamonds at a discount.
And never pass up a good discount, right?
I know what you're thinking...
Like, diamonds, discounts, those are some like classic Jew moves, you know?
Jayma has something to ask you.
Look, I know that this is sudden, and we haven't known each other that long...
God, I feel like I'm proposing or something.
You've been such a good friend to the family.
You wrote Jastenity that letter to get into Harvard.
Unfortunately the letter was better than her application, but she did get into Cal State Northridge, which is the Harvard of Northridge.
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, how would you like to be a bridesmaid at my wedding?
You mean, be an official part of the Chan fam-bam?
She'd love to.
You want me to be a bridesmaid.
Aw, you're such a lovely girl, Rebecca.
We would be so honored if you would become a part of our family wedding.
And you are the perfect height to pair with Phillip's friend, Daniel, who stopped growing after being a kid gymnast.
Um, actually, I-I don't know if I should.
Okay, hey, why don't we just... ?
O-One second, Chan ladies.
One-one second.
Okay, this would kill Valencia.
Down in the ground.
Like a bug.
Legs in the air.
Now she's a ghost, boo.
Okay, but, Paula, what have I been saying?
I need to disengage and disentangle from dis family.
Seriously, I-I want to make amends to Valencia, and this is like the opposite of that.
Yeah, okay, well, who says no to being a bridesmaid?
I mean, who does that?
Monster people.
Is Valencia a bridesmaid?
Uh, not exactly.
By that she means no.
Like, ew, no.
Here's the thing, I-I'd love to be a bridesmaid, but I don't think it would be fair for me to be a bridesmaid and for Valencia not to be.
And Josh has asked for Valencia to be a bridesmaid about 50 times, so...
Great, so you get what I'm trying to say.
So you can both be in the wedding.
Sorry, what's that?
You and Valencia can both be bridesmaids.
That way you don't have to worry about her not being included.
Very wise, Jayma.
It's settled, then.
Yeah, it is!
I know you, from Spider's.
You were the sourpuss fighting with the girl in the shiny dress.
Hey, I'm, I'm not a sourpuss.
I'm pensive and deep.
Are you dusting potatoes?
I like to look busy.
Well, you're out of dark roast.
I can't study without dark roast.
Could you get on that?
Oh, yeah, sure, uh, no problemo.
Are we being pleasant now?
Sorry, I don't know your rules.
So, you two an item?
Me and Ally?
Oh, I wish.
She quit her job as a manager at a Whole Foods, came to work here.
I could not figure out why for the longest time.
And then I realized...
♪ Grocery clerk with half an eyelid. ♪
His name is Brody.
I can't compete with him.
He has the flattop of a Greek god.
This!
Whoa, you are so good at magic.
Uh-uh-uh. A true magician never reveals his secrets.
Come on, Brody.
So you like her.
I don't have a shot.
I mean, look at her.
I should give up.
I know that's the right decision.
Are you sure... she doesn't like you?
Ally, though.
That's my type, too.
Oh, that's so hot.
Okay, bro, I gotcha.
I know exactly what you need to do.
So, you and Valencia are friends?
Uh, kinda.
I'd say we share a history of common interests.
Of course, she's late.
She's the kind of person that has to make an entrance.
You know what? I don't think that's fair.
I wouldn't stereotype her as someone that...
Oh, sorry I'm late.
I just had some pictures taken for my Hometown Hotties submission to Maxim.
We ready to try on some dresses?
Jas, come on.
Let's go pick out the first round of dresses.
- Hey. - Whoa!
Hey, Valencia, hi, oh, uh, this is going to be so fun.
Are you ready to be, like, bridesmaid buddies?
I want to make myself very, very clear.
I know about the kiss.
And if it were any other situation, I would take off my earrings, my extensions, and my wings, and curb-stomp you.
Got it, that's fair.
But, for some reason, you're the one that got me into this wedding party.
Josh told me it was all you.
- He did? - Yep.
I mean,
I don't know why you did it, but I don't care.
Just stay out of my way and don't make me look bad to these people.
Hey, Valencia, I can do better than that.
I can make you look good.
Yeah, yeah, like, by the end of this, they're going to want to adopt you.
But maybe that's not, like, precisely what you want, but...
Oh, just shut up.
How about this?
This seems like a style that would work on everyone.
Well, most of us.
Valencia's right.
Uh, you know, uh, two-piece, halter, mesh dress might work well for you very lean ladies, but, yeah, not for this festival of back fat going on.
Okay, well, what about... this?
Those are such beautiful nipple covers.
Yeah, those would definitely cover most of my nipples.
Yeah, guys, let me remind you, I eat bagels at night...
Valencia knows.
She knows all about my night bagels... tell 'em, V.
Here's what you didn't know.
For my midnight bagel, I eat it with butter, cream cheese, and... bacon.
Seriously. S-R-S-L-Y.
Like, true story.
Okay, so why don't we try different styles in the same color?
That's so Ni...
You know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's, like, really gracious.
It is, actually, a, a good idea.
So you kids can go crazy with your halters and your sheaths and your cutouts, and I will wear a dress fit to upholster a chair.
And I will wear it with pride.
Rebecca, come on.
Yeah, you're not that disgustingly fat.
Aw, thank you, Valencia.
What have we said about standing places, quietly waiting for people?
Okay, so how did it go with Valencia at the dress shop?
Did you find any weaknesses?
I was thinking that we could use your role as bridesmaid to really mess her up.
My first thought was poison oak in the dress.
Rashy nips, instant classic. Paula.
We're not doing any of that.
- We're not.
We're just acting like normal people.
I'm going to be like any other teenage ex-boyfriend's sister's last-minute bridesmaid.
Yeah, so just be cool.
I have my orders.
Where can a person buy poison oak, and what is the rashiest kind?
Richard Kind is a 59-year-old actor, best known for his role in Spin City.
No. Poison oak, rashiest kind.
Jim Rash is the award-winning writer of The Descendants.
You're sure this is a good idea?
Dude, she doesn't like you.
She's shown no interest.
She's way into someone else.
Why give up now?
This is the right move.
Um, can I have everyone's attention, please?
Hey, someone's trying to let it rip here.
This goes out to a young lady currently restocking feminine products.
It's called "Clean Up on Aisle 4."
Not an actual cleanup, Rick.
♪ Clean up my heart on Aisle 4 ♪
♪ 'Cause that's where it lays in a heap of green olives ♪

Oh, my God, it's working.
Look out, everybody, it's my body!
Whee! Teach me, teach me!
Uh-uh, it's too hard.
You didn't tell me he was a gymnast.
Eh, can we get back to work, or am I boring you?
I'm sor... it's a... it's a bridesmaid text chain.
It's about... it's about the word "cummerbund""
It's... it's a funny word.
Sorry. Let's get back to the case.
The case? Who cares about the case?
When are you getting the bridesmaid gowns?
'Cause I got a guy in Maine who's going to send me some primo itchy, sticky plants.
And he said he was going to throw in a couple deer ticks for, you know, a little extra...
Um, what are you talking about?
Our plan - rashy nips.
- Oh. - I say we roll the dice for, you know, some possible Lyme disease.
I have so much to say...
Oh, oh, it's from Jayma.
It says emergency.
SOS. 411.
She means 911.
I wonder if Phillip got cold feet.
There's no plan.
The dance we do.
- Hey, what's the emergency?
- I don't know, do you?
And it won't be easy.
My dress is done early, and I brought champagne!
Valencia's so funny.
Oh, Valencia, tell them about the part with the old lady.
Yeah, so, this 90-year-old lady was in downward dog, and I said to her, "Okay, just breathe into it."
"If I breathe into it any harder, I'm gonna toot."
Oh, she's so funny.
She has a million yoga stories like these.
Well, I've been practicing my humor.
I watched an online tutorial.
This was so much fun, you guys.
When Joshy and I get married, I want all of you to be in the wedding.
I mean, would it kill you to say something?
She's not wrong, Ruby.
You're a dud.
Ah, man, I am tipsy.
This was so fun.
Oh, Jas, we got to go meet mom at the cake-tasting.
Can you guys stay and make skee the dress gets packed away perfectly?
Like no wrinkles or bubbles.
Valencia and I got this.
Yep, we got it.
Thanks, V.
You know, we all thought you were heinous, but you're kind of okay.
- All right, bye, ladies.
- Bye, Jayma.
Drink a glass of water.
They don't think I'm heinous anymore.
Jastenity even offered me a half stick of gum.
I said no because I bloat, but still...
Well, I guess we should, um, get the girls to pack up this big-ass dress.
Wow, this would look even worse on me than some of the others.
Oh, come on, stop.
I mean, you make jokes about your body, and they're pretty funny and mostly accurate, but with your big boobs, that dress would look great.
I'd be spilling out of this thing, and not like in a sexy, on purpose,
Christina Hendricks type of way.
Guys don't care.
Guys love big boobs like yours.
I mean, sometimes I hate my small boobs.
I mean, I thought about getting implants.
No, don't do that.
Oh, my gosh, Valencia, if you knew what went into having a pair of monsters like these, you would never think about getting them again.
Rebecca, you can't.
Valencia, once I put this dress on, you will never envy these puppies again.
There... yep.

Now, you try on the dress.
Let's see how it looks with some nice B-cup action in there.
No. I couldn't.
Valencia, you're going to make a really beautiful bride.
Josh is really lucky.
I hope some day it is Josh and me, I really do.
It will be.
And I'm so sorry if I did anything to delay that dream.
I appreciate you saying that.
Do you mind taking a picture of me?
Just for me.
I want to remember how I looked.
Oh, I got nothing to work with here.
I mean, I've already hacked into Valencia's e-mails and her texts.
Ooh, wait a minute, what's this?
A photo stream?
Oh, again.
You with the face.
What do you mean, how did I get Valencia's password?
Let's see what we've got here.
Valencia's photos... chocolate cake... fried chicken...
Oh, she just likes to look at food.
Oh, wait a minute, what is this?
I think that's Jayma's wedding gown.
You know, I've... I've prayed to God my whole life, and I, and I never knew if she was listening, but... thank you, Big Mama.
Uh, no wrinkles.
- Yeah, or bubbles.
We got this.
It says I have a new like on a photo.
I-I didn't take a photo, what is this?
Yeah, bitch.
- What's wrong with you?
#HotterThanTheBride?
I-I-I didn't do anything.
I didn't post a photo.
And my hashtags are always positive.
Like, #GirlBoss or #Fitspo.
Someone must be framing me or something.
What kind of psycho with no life would do such a thing?
Oh, God, Paula.
You must have done it.
When I went to the bathroom.
This is why women don't go to the bathroom alone.
Excuse me, miss, I have a bone to pick with you.
I'm sorry, sir.
Yes, you can.
By helping yourself.
Stop chasing after the cartwheeling magician idiot boy, and start paying attention to the guy with the bountiful, beautiful hair, who happens to really care about you.
Oh, you're friends with Marty.
I prefer mentor.
Ah, well, I've already told him I'm not interested.
Him continuing to chase after me is a terrible decision, which makes me respect him even less.
I mean, maybe if he backed off and let me come to him, maybe I would think about it.
Otherwise, can you tell him to stop with the songs and the texts and the skywriting?
What did you skywrite?
Lyrics to the song.
Cost a fortune.
Oh, and it was so windy.
I basically paid for a cloud.
So what's next, coach?
What do I do? What's my next move?
I kind of think we do nothing.
Like for a day?
We slow-playing?
I actually think forever.
I think we got to call this one.
Go back to dusting potatoes.
You laugh, but who likes a dusty potato?
Marty, Ally's right.
Chasing someone who isn't into you is a terrible move.
Trust me, I feel you.
You mean you and Rebecca Bunch.
Your friends come in here all the time talking about it.
God, I hate my friends.
Yeah, Marty, that's right.
I did that with Rebecca.
But watching you do it, I see what a bad call it was.
Actually, I'm realizing, I make a lot of bad calls...
in everything.
And I think we're the same.
I mean, I work here in a grocery store, even though I went to Harvard.
The Harvard of what?
Just Harvard.
In Boston.
Your decisions are just the worst.
Look, I already deleted it, so don't worry.
And we only got one like and it was from...
OMG, it's from Maxim's Hometown Hotties.
I'm telling you, it was Rebecca.
She's been "Single White Femaling" me since she got here.
Valencia...
You take one step closer, and I'm getting a restraining order,
Jennifer Jason Leigh.
What I was going to say was, um...
Yep, it was me.
It was my idea for Valencia to put on the wedding dress, and then when I saw her in it, I-I got jealous.
And so I, uh, I stole her phone and I posted the picture.
Only someone crazy and sad would do that.
Um, yeah, and I'm both those things, so I'm, um, I'm sorry.
Valencia, I'm sorry we accused you.
Rebecca, you should go.
Good-bye, Chans.
Before you start, you don't have to buy me champagne or a fur coat; just a simple thank you will suffice.
Valencia's password was so easy.
Valencia1.
I mean, come on.
Just get in my office.
I told you not to do anything.
I mean, why didn't you listen to me?
Oh, my God, why didn't I listen to you?
Because if I listen to you, nothing would ever happen with Josh.
No Thanksgiving, no camp.
You, you didn't do all that by yourself.
And every time you said, "No, Paula, don't do anything."
And then I did anyway, and you were happy.
Wow, yeah, you're right.
Okay, that's the way it used to be, but it's not like that anymore, okay?
Paula, listen to me.
I'm done with Josh.
Oh, come on, I saw you.
You can't even throw away the macaroni portrait.
- I threw it away.
Everything's gone. - Even Channy bear.
Channy bear sleeps with the fishes.
I can't give up on Josh.
He's not yours to give up on.
Why are you so hung up on this?
It-It's to make you happy.
No, it's not, because I just told...
It's because...
If we're not chasing Josh, then you're not going to want to hang out with me anymore.
Paula, no.
Yes. Yes, it is.
He's our glue.
He's what holds us together, and...
I've barely seen you this week at all.
Paula, I love you.
Okay, you know that.
But we have to stop.
It's not good for me.
You and I will always be friends, okay, I promise.
But we don't need Josh Chan.
Because I don't need him.
Hey. Hi. I'm sorry, I, um, I needed somewhere to drink, and I thought, I thought you'd be at school.
What'll it be?
It's last call.
I guess, I don't know, I'll take some alcohol.
Do you know any alcohol names?
I will take a peach schnapps on the rocks?
Never order drinks again.
I'll make you something.
That's a lot of books you got there.
Yeah, I'm trying this really new radical approach to studying...
It's called studying.
Wow. Is it working?
It's this really exotic drink called the gin and tonic.
Well, I've never heard of a gin and tonic before, but I think it's gonna be really big.
I'm sending in the patent.
Hey, what are you doing after this?
Do you want to, like, I don't know, go to another bar, get a drink, or hang out at my place, or...
Did you and Josh get in a fight...
And you need a shoulder to cry on?
So you come to Greg, 'cause that's what I do.
No, that's not what this is.
Rebecca, I would really love to hang out with you,
I would, but I know what that leads to for me.
I can't be in second place again with you.
Um, good to know.
I'm... I'm gonna go.
Oh, Josh, I thought you were someone else, I...
Y-Y-You hacked into Valencia's phone?
Y-You said you were trying to keep your distance from me, a-and then you do this?
This is how you make it up to Valencia?
Okay, Josh, it's a long story, but all that matters is
Valencia is now beloved by your family
- and I'm out of the bridal party.
Josh, focus on your girlfriend and on your family, okay?
And the next time you want to come and talk to me, don't just show up at my door.
Oh... okay.
Yeah, okay, cool.
Um, so could you go?
I-I-I have something I need to do.
Are you kicking me out?
Lil' bit.
Bye, Josh.
I'm sorry, Channy bear.
No, I c... I-I can't do this.
I-I can't eat a dusty potato.
Oh, God, is that what I taste like?
I mean, I, I ate a, an old French fry off the floor of my car, but I sh...
Wa... you did what?
No, good God, stop, woman.
Greg, listen to me.
This isn't about anyone else but you.
You're not second choice.
Listen, if this is going to happen, - you need to know something. - Okay.
This isn't going to be like a roll in the hay and you go home.
This is going to be like three days of you and me just ruining each other.
And not emotionally.
I'm so glad we're finally doing this.
I mean, there's so many girls I could have brought here, like a whole bunch, but I chose you, Ashley.
Can we have sex now? Yay.
And you're horrible.
Why do I always make the same mistake over and over again?
I make terrible decisions.
I go for the lowest form of man because I'm afraid to be with someone I might actually connect with.
You know what? Screw this.
I'm going back to nursing school.
Wait, do you want me to do another cartwheel?
I'm-I'm-I'm good at those.
And now Behind The Wall, the making of Colony...
My fellow colonists, welcome to day 341 of our occupation.
Our choice is clear.
Resist or die.
- Roll sound!
- Take marker.
Colony, USA Network's blockbuster original series, is one of the most anticipated new shows of the year.
We came up with this idea of setting an occupation
- in modern day Los Angeles.
- It's current.
It's as if this happened now.
To be here, bringing it to life, and to see the scope and scale, it's the most awesome part of the process.
Over the next half hour, you'll get an inside, behind-the-scenes look at this intriguing new series, including interviews with the creators and cast...
I tend to like a big story that I can't even figure out myself.
...exclusive footage from the set and a sneak peek at the unique and amazing world imagined by the creators and crew.
They don't know this yet, so just between you and me, you know, and whoever is watchin', we'll let them know.
This is Colony-- Behind The Wall.
Get down!
You, come here!
What is this?
- Come here!
- I haven't done anything!
You can't do this, please!
Colony is a story about occupied Los Angeles.
It's about family.
It centers around my family and our struggle to survive.
It's kind of a family espionage thriller, but with some science fiction elements.
What would you do, put in this situation?
What would you do for your children?
What would you do for humanity?
Who come-who comes first?
Colony is the brainchild of creators and executive producers,
Carlton Cuse and Ryan Condal.
Ryan and Carlton are this kind of amazing dynamic duo.
Carlton and I are both huge syfy fans, but we're also big fans of history.
And one of the things that we both were fascinated by was Paris, during Nazi occupation.
We thought that was a really interesting and incongruous image, that people were trying so hard to kind of keep the normalcy of their lives under this incredibly repressive regime.
It just fascinated us, and we wondered,
"Well, what would that look like in-in our city, where-where we both live?"
And we talked to Legendary about it.
We set it up with USA.
And then we made the pilot last year.
And now, here we are, making a series.
Legendary makes their first foray into television drama, with Colony, and brings together a stellar cast, led by Josh Holloway of Lost.
Carlton called me, like,
"I have an offer you can't refuse."
And Sarah Wayne Callies of The Walking Dead.
It's a story I believe in.
It's a character that I've never seen before.
The acclaimed cast also includes three-time Emmy winner, Kathy Baker, of Picket Fences,
Peter Jacobson of House,
Amanda Righetti of The Mentalist,
True Detective's Tory Kittles,
Carl Weathers of Rocky fame...
Apollo creed!
...and Paul Guilfoyle of CSI.
We feel like we've really got some great actors on our show.
We were kinda just with the characters.
We're sort of seeing the world through their eyes.
You have this world in which these people, who maybe were neighbors at one time, find themselves at odds with each other.
One of the things about reading the script, it made me think about, how far you'd be willing to go to resist.
It was a pilot that was about family, and about people making really, really difficult choices.
For people to come back, week to week, it all begins and ends with the characters.
It's a political environment.
Everything you do has a political component.
Throughout human history, we've either occupied someone, or been occupied by someone else.
It's shocking what human beings will do in these situations.
What would you do to survive?
What are the compromises you would make?
What are the things that you would be capable of doing?
And you, you stink.
At the center of the show, is the Bowmann family.
Will is a former FBI agent, forced underground by the Occupation.
All the people who were police, and authority figures, military, was wiped out during the arrival, and Will was smart enough to go underground.
He and his wife, Katie, must navigate this new world, where freedom no longer exists, and the consequences for disobedience are deadly.
Their relationship is already complicated.
They have true love at the core.
Yet, they've lost a child.
And that's fracturing the family in various ways.
It's bad enough he's gone, but to see you every day hating me for it.
I don't hate you for it.
Will and Katie are desperate to get their kid back.
And so, Will hired this guy to smuggle him into Santa Monica, to rescue Charlie.
You'll be my 38th run.
You got nothin' to worry about.
Hop in.
You have entered the exclusion zone.
Remain inside your vehicle until otherwise directed.
My box kills x-ray and thermal.
They'll never know we were here.
Hands where we can see them!
- Get 'em up!
- Move, now!
- On your knees!
Keep 'em up!
Put your hands behind your head!
Get me a medic, now!
Coming up, on Colony-- Behind The Wall...
Find out how the show's creators built the world of occupied Los Angeles utilizing firsthand accounts...
Juan, our director, grew up in Argentina, under a dictatorship.
...state of the art effects technology.
Story always comes first.
The visual effects are a way to augment and help tell that story.
...and good, old-fashioned Hollywood magic.
Where is my phone call?
- I want my phone call.
- I need to call my wife.
Occupied Los Angeles is a world very much like our own...
There's blue sky.
There's palm trees.
There's good weather.
...with some eerie differences.
There's an unscalable wall that surrounds the city.
Show creators, production designers, and visual effects specialists combine with cast and crew to bring this incredible world to life.
Colony is this kinda wonderful blend of-of elements that give you a-a really unique look on what life in Los Angeles would be like if we were actually occupied.
This world's just that ten percent different enough to really kind of make you sit back and say, "Whoa.
What-what's happened here?"
The show picks up nearly a year after the arrival.
A cataclysmic invasion that changed everything.
Every defense apparatus was wiped out within eight hours.
All of a sudden,
Los Angeles and its millions of citizens, their lives were completely turned upside down.
Many were killed, many were taken away.
One of the first things that happened after the arrival is, pretty much all the cars went away.
So, this is a very different Los Angeles.
A lot of people are on foot or riding bicycles, so it has this very kind of Parisian feel to the city.
We tried to kinda come up with this idea that beauty and oppression could co-exist.
You know, Los Angeles could look pretty and inviting, but, at the same time, it's clearly now a hostile environment.
What's great about what Carlton and Ryan have done in the concept, is just that idea of isolating it, fencing in groups of people, creates this tension.
Slowly, but surely, you're feeling what it is to be oppressed.
I'm a stickler for the-for the logic of, uh, of the occupation, and of a dictatorship, and how this mentality works.
I grew up in Argentina, uh, during the '70s, where we had a dictatorship.
A very-- a-a pretty rough one, but that a lot of the society was for it.
And I can see that happening very easily in America.
Was an explosion at the Santa Monica gateway, yesterday.
It was the Resistance.
- Those terrorists wounded at least ten people.
Who knows how many more they killed?
We were going for a look that had a much more documentary style.
We really wanted to make it look and feel very real.
That this could really be happening.
It's very handheld, and, you know, many times, we-we staged the scene, without any specific instructions to the camera operators.
And then we just put, you know, the three cameras, as if they were a news team that are covering the scene for the first time.
Uh, so it feels very immediate, very real.
The production designer is in charge of the look of the TV show.
I'm responsible for all of the things in front of the camera.
From building the sets to decorating the sets.
The sets are beautiful, which, right away, for an actor, that puts you in a good place.
So, The Yonk is my bar.
This bar.
The Yonk is short for Yoknapatawpha, which took me some time to learn how to say.
- I love The Yonk.
It's kind of a bar that has a Southern vibe to it.
It definitely feels real.
Oh, well, look who made it after all!
Oh, you think I'd miss the opportunity to drink publicly for the first time in 11 months?
As a designer, I was kind of excited about all of the kinda graphic qualities to it.
Resistance posters, and posters that are more like pro-Occupation.
By the visuals of what we put on the screen, we're telling the audience where you are.
The visual effects are a huge part, uh, of this show.
We have this tremendous visual effects partner, in Ghost, who is our, uh, visual effects studio, out of, uh, Copenhagen, in Denmark.
They visualized an amazing pilot.
Our walls, the 300-foot walls that surround Los Angeles, are an entirely digital creation, as are the drones that patrol the skies.
Yeah, the drones are-- th-they are little characters of their own right.
Th-they are, essentially, acting.
They're in patrol mode, in seek and destroy mode.
In modes that we don't know what they're really thinking.
Even though they're mechanical, and they're just whizzing around, you'll actually see, they have different personalities.
Ryan geeks out on all the science fiction stuff.
Like, he was showing me pictures of drones, and we were jumping up and down like children.
You know, it was like, yes!
I've always wanted to be in Battlestar Galactica, and, like, Star Wars, and all these amazing shows, and we get to do stuff like that.
The most difficult thing for actors is trying to imagine elements such as drones that they've never even seen.
And my role is to assist them to imagine this world.
So, it's especially challenging on a blue screen, or a green screen as well.
The toughest thing is, really, it's the cars.
Los Angeles is a very busy city.
Well known for, uh, its greatest export,
- which is traffic.
- To clean up these roads, and to make it look like we're in a no-car environment, is really, really difficult.
So, we lock down lanes of traffic as much as possible.
We pick off little pieces from our plate shots that don't have traffic in them, and it's a really painful process of painting them out.
- Fire in the hole!
- Action!
Today is probably the-- one of the biggest shots.
We're gonna have bullet hits.
Uh, alien drones whizzing in from the background.
Next week, we're, uh, blowing up an entire house.
Each week, we get more and more exciting effects.
Coming up, on Colony-- Behind The Wall, we'll explore occupied Los Angeles, and discover the challenges faced by its citizens.
If you're resourceful and clever, you can survive this occupation.
Both the Collaborators...
There's no victory to be had against these people.
What there is, is compromise.
...and the Resistance.
There's a lot of fear and consternation goin' on.
That's a good word, "consternation."
Consternation in-in the colony.
As you dig deeper into Colony, you'll discover the oppressive new world under which the citizens of Los Angeles are forced to live.
There's no communication.
There's no internet.
There's no cell phone service.
There's no information that goes outside of these walls.
I'm lookin' for Will Bowmann.
Are you Will Bowmann?
Los Angeles is now under martial law.
A giant wall separates the city into three blocks, each administered by a proxy government.
There's Santa Monica, there's the Los Angeles block, and there's the San Fernando Valley block.
- Green Zone.
In the LA block, where our characters live, you either live in the flats or you live in the Green Zone.
The Green Zone is the more privileged area, where the people that collaborate with the transitional authority live.
The Hollywood Hills and Bel Air, all those houses have been taken over and are occupied by the new elite.
They're leading very nice, luxurious lives, whereas the regular citizens are not.
They're subject to rations and repression.
The show sort of explores that dichotomy.
I'm the Proxy Governor of our little block here.
To turn crisis into opportunity.
I take question with the fact that he's a bad guy.
He collaborates with a clean conscience because I think that Snyder believes truly that he is a force for good change.
Wait-wait-wait.
You can't-- Ahh!
After the arrival, the Occupation government established their own police force, which the citizens refer to as The Red House.
They run ads, just like army ads. They're tryin' to recruit people to control other people.
There's a military curfew in effect every night.
The things that you used to take for granted, like walking down the street to go get a cup of coffee, are not so easy anymore.
You don't know, at any given moment, whether you might get hauled out of your house and taken away, never to be seen again.
My brother got sent up.
The Factory.
What is The Factory they keep talking about?
Is it a concentration camp?
Nobody really knows what The Factory is, or what it's making, but what we do know is, is that people who go to The Factory don't ever come back.
In opposition to this new totalitarian regime, stands the Resistance.
A shadowy group of fighters led by the mysterious Geronimo.
The Resistance wants very much to end this occupation.
These are just everyday men and women whose lives have been turned upside down.
People are willing to risk their lives to make change.
- A revolution.
How big is the Resistance?
Who runs it?
What's their grand plan?
How organized are they?
Those are all mysteries that are a part of the show.
Our hosts are tired of the insurgency.
You want me to collaborate.
Infiltrate the insurgency and bring us their leader.
Does he agree with resisting?
Yes, but they're going about it in the wrong way.
They're getting innocent people killed.
Amidst these warring factions,
Will and Katie struggle to keep their family safe.
They try to live their life the way they had before it was ripped out from under them.
Family in a world like this takes on a new primacy.
Madeline's living with them, her sister.
And Hudson, Madeline's son.
For Maddie, finding insulin for her son is-is one of the biggest challenges.
Certain conditions are deemed unworthy for treatment.
Diabetes is one of 'em.
This has to be kept cold.
It's way too hot in here.
What do you think you're doin'?
- I'm not buying insulin.
- A trade is a trade!
and our characters are trying to navigate their way through this and survive.
If you can't help me, then you and your wife, and your children, you'll all be sent to The Factory.
The most important day in human history is coming.
I just want you and your family to be on the right side of it.
The audience will learn more about who these mysterious invaders are, what they want, what they're up to, what their powers are.
There are all these sort of layers to the show that will be explored over time.
Coming up, find out how the cast answers the question, collaborate or resist?
I don't know if I would have the courage to risk my children.
And the creators give us a special sneak peek of a scene from the premiere episode.
- Don't tell him.
Don't- - Just because he asked nicely doesn't mean
- you're gonna tell.
- Keep watching.
Cameras and marker.
Actor number two, action!
Colony, USA Network's new original series, is a high-stakes drama about surviving in a new world.
It's an old human story, but this is unlike any enemy we've faced before.
These characters, they come up against all sorts of dilemmas about, what are some of the compromises that we need to make in order to survive?
Who are you, deep down?
What kind of character do you have?
And what would you do for your family?
The characters in Colony must walk the fine line between Collaboration and Resistance.
Nothing and no one is what they seem.
You don't know who to trust.
We lie to everyone.
We lie to protect ourselves.
Why are they collaborating?
What is at stake for them?
And that is the beauty of this show.
It's a character-driven study of perspectives.
And now, here's an exclusive sneak peek at a scene from Colony.
Get off!
USA Network, Legendary Television, and creators and executive producers,
Carlton Cuse and Ryan Condal, have created the next great television drama.
All great stories are, at their core, human stories.
We get to take a fantastic universe and use it to examine the contemporary issues of our own world.
It's about humans battling humans.
It's about the things we're capable of doing to each other.
It focuses on that unbreakable family bond.
Big, heavy, moral decisions.
Revolution.
We're not telling you who's right and who's wrong.
There's no black and white hats.
There are red hats.
Kind of end up with this bit of a Casablanca story.
It's this crossroads of the world, where different people from all walks,
Occupation, and Resistance.
And then the people that are just caught in between, trying to survive.
Hopefully, it'll put yourself in the shoes of our characters and our show, and you'll wanna ask the fundamental questions.
Like, would I collaborate?
Would I be in the Resistance?
What lies outside the LA block?
Is the world destroyed?
It's all a mystery, and that's the fun of the show.
These are things we'll have to discover.
All of this, it's temporary.
Once they've satisfied their needs, they'll leave.
What needs?
Colony premieres Thursday, January 14th, at 10/9 Central, only on USA.
The time has come to make your choice.
Do you collaborate or resist?
That's a heavy question.
It's easy for anybody to sit and say,
"I'd do this" or "I'd do that."
- I resist. - I might collaborate, if I got to make television shows.
I would like to think that I would resist.
I would really take my time to make that decision.
I may be a huge coward.
When ya can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Collaborate and die.
I would do whatever it took to save my family.
Finding a job where you get to work side by side with your friends can be the best.
It can also be the worst.
I came in with two friends!
My name is Cooper Barrett.
My friends and I are here to mess up our lives so you don't have to.
_
- To our success.
- Hey, how'd you know I was here?
You're always here.
What's the occasion?
Oh, uh, their hangover cure was just named "Best New Specialty Beverage"
Because of us, everyone from your casual Chardonnay sipper to your hardened alcoholic is waking up to a better American morning.
This is how Dr. Penicillin must have felt when he created the what-cha-ma-call-it.
There are so many things wrong with that statement.
- Who are you looking for?
- I was hoping my girl Kelly would be here so we could hang out, 'cause, you know, we have a thing.
Oh, like a Patty from college thing?
No, there can never be another Patty.
That thing was like a powder keg.
Kelly and I are just, you know, we're besties.
- Who's that?
I would like to introduce you all to my new girlfriend, Ramona.
Howdy, y'all. Nice to meet you.
Let me guess.
No, but Kelly bet me ten bucks
I couldn't do the accent.
She can.
I'm actually from London.
- Oh, really?
- Nope.
Orange County.
You owe me another ten.
Oh, God, you're so good at accents!
What the hell is going on?
Nice to meet you. I'm, uh, Cooper Barrett.
Ramona.
- Cooper?
- Can I talk with you for a sec?
- Sure. Sorry.
- Knock it off.
- What did I do?
You just used your "I want to sleep with you" voice.
"Hi. I'm Cooper Barrett."
I sound like Optimus Prime?
You are not to sleep with her.
What?
'Cause of... 'cause of this.
There's no this.
- So I can sleep with her.
Listen.
Solid girlfriends do not come easy to me, and I don't want you and your penis messing it up.
Okay, first of all, she hasn't even expressed any interest.
And second, if she did, and I went through with it, I hope you know I respect you enough to never tell you about it.
Fine, I won't sleep with her. Thank you.
Hi. I'm Cooper Barrett.
Hi. I'm Cooper Barrett.
- There it is.
Pretty great, right?
Can't buy publicity like that. Free sample.
Oh, thanks. This makes it seem like you run the company by yourself. Yeah, you don't even mention us one time in this whole thing.
"Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure," not Cooper's.
Your grandma hasn't been hungover a day in her life!
Come on, guys, let's focus on the big picture, all right?
- if I was given the opportunity.
- "When asked how he was able
"to accomplish so much, he credited the inspiration of Steve Jobs and a good night's sleep."
Yeah, you're right. That was my window, I blew it.
- I'm sorry. I...
- "And later, he wished to thank
"his two best friends: hard work
- and determination."
- Oh, guys, I messed up.
Yeah, hold that thought.
Get your free sample.
Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure?
- I've heard that stuff's made in an apartment, and you can taste pig feces.
Where'd you hear that?
"Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure is made in an apartment with pig feces."
That's simply untrue.
I mean, he hasn't had an accident in weeks.
I mean, if they would have said pig urine...
There's comments from this CooperSucks person all over the net.
Obviously, the person who's posting this has inside information, so they can do serious damage to our business, if they haven't already.
Okay, so how do we find out who this CooperSucks69 is?
I'm one step ahead of you, sir.
I've traced the IP address, and it looks like it's someone... in our apartment building.
- What do you want?
- Hey, Virgil.
Uh... someone's been trolling Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure online.
Uh, you wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
What is... trolling?
Uh, it means people are making fun of us on the Internet.
Ooh. Which site do I do that?
We're not telling you to do that.
Oh, I'll find out.
I have so many "Barry's Grandma's so fat" jokes.
Do you really think Mrs. Billingsly is our troll?
She's, like, 90 years old.
Well, we have to cross everyone in the building off our list.
I haven't seen her in a few weeks. Come to think of it, neither have I.
Well, at least she led a good life.
Actually, I think she collaborated in the Armenian genocide. But still, neat lady.
I don't get it. We've checked every apartment.
Well, not every apartment.
I never would've suspected it.
What are you guys doing in my apartment?
Welcome home...
Or should we say, CooperSucks69?
Wait.
Were the first 68 CooperSucks already taken?
This is impossible.
Had anyone else in your apartment recently?
- Any male visitors, perhaps?
- Or poltergeists?
I seen this episode of Ghost Hunters where this one ghost went into this one dude's account and messed up his credit. Spooky.
No guys or ghosts have been in my apartment.
I'm the only one who uses this computer.
Oh, and Ramona.
Wait, wait, wait, hold up. Say Ramona's last name is Miller.
- Right?
- You're already forgetting her name.
You slept with her, didn't you? !
- You said she was a trainer?
- Yeah. So?
Because Ramona Miller is not a personal trainer.
She is the President and CEO of HangEnder, our main competitor.
She clearly saw us as a threat, posed to be your friend, just to get info about us to try to take us down!
To think, I almost slept with her.
Come to think of it, she was asking a lot of questions about your company.
Why the hell you tell her about our pig feces?
Why are you living in an apartment with pig feces?
It's stinking up the entire building.
I think that smell was Mrs. Billingsly.
What happened to Mrs. Billingsly?
Honey,
- Oh, my God!
I lose two of my best girlfriends in one day? I'm gonna punch Ramona in her lying, flawless face!
Best plan is to get even.
I have an idea how to do that.
So do I, so what we do is...
We all listen to Neal because I value his ideas.
Thanks, Coop.
Okay, Kelly, first, you're gonna take Ramona out to brunch.
But don't let on that you know who she really is.
Sorry. You're doing great.
Just pretend like it's a normal brunch. And then I punch her in the face.
No. You make witty conversation.
So, tell me about all that personal training
- that you definitely do for a living.
- Oh, you know,
- lots of burpees, that sort of thing.
Will you excuse me?
I have to go to the bathroom really quick.
And then when she's not paying attention, you take her computer and pass it off to Barry in disguise.
- Fake mustache and tuxedo?
Cooper, be supportive. Yes, Barry, like that, but, you know, something better.
Barry, you'll go to the kitchen where you'll find me and Cooper waiting.
- I'm meeting Leslie next door for lunch. I heard you guys were hiding in the kitchen.
- By the way, it's me, Barry.
- You look like Neil deGrasse Tyson.
- Just like the Milky Way.
- Come on, Neal.
Hurry up! Got to get it before she gets back from the restroom.
She should really update this thing.
- I mean, OS 7? Total noob.
- Neal!
Got the data. All right. Out.
All we have to do is return it before Ramona gets back.
Unless Josh's wife comes by, notices Kelly, and ruins the entire plan.
Welcome to my life.
- Kelly!
- Leslie!
I thought I saw you.
You know what? I'm glad I'm running into you, because I feel like we need to reconnect.
Why is...? What-what is she doing here?
Leslie, you remember Ramona, right?
You didn't answer my question.
Please go do something.
I mean, I'm...
I'm gonna meet my husband. We're gonna go have brunch
- next door.
Socially, you know,
- I'm pretty covered.
- Hey, babe!
I was just walking by, saw you ladies chatting it up.
Uh, look at that. Shoelace is untied.
- Dangerous. There it is.
So you guys, like, hang out all the time?
Nope, wasn't untied.
It was actually tied the whole time.
- Thank God. - We should go. We got a res.
- Right, yeah.
- Bouncedy-bounce.
Yeah, okay, bye.
Just so you know, 37 followers on Instagram, so, you know, super popular.
- She doesn't care.
And once we successfully
- put it back in Ramona's bag...
...go through her data, cancel her orders, and later, Cooper will call to contact her clients.
Well, I am sorry to hear that they canceled, but we have a vehicle in your area which can get our product to you within the hour.
All right, thanks so much.
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm. Can you believe it? Your plan worked.
Yeah, Cooper, I can believe it.
Can you believe that our nearest star, Alpha Centauri, is only four light years away?
Can I just say, I am really enjoying your Neil deGrasse Tyson.
It is fun and informative.
You know what else is fun?
The Milky Way.
No, you already used that one.
Pluto is one-third water. There he is!
This fancy hotel looks a lot like a biker bar.
It's like an episode of Sons of Anarchy that doesn't end well.
I'm pretty sure there is no episodes of Sons of Anarchy
- I'm telling you, this is the address listed on Ramona's work order.
This is Cooper.
This is Ramona Miller.
- I'm actually...
- The President and CEO
- of HangEnder. I know exactly who...
- Who I am?
I know that you know, but here's something you don't know.
That order you took from me was a fake.
- What order?
- Moron, give it up. I've been one step ahead of you this whole time.
You may be easy on the eyes, but that doesn't mean that you know how to run a business.
First rule is, don't ever work with your friends.
Second rule is shut up.
You're obviously flailing here. Let me put you out of your misery and buy your company from you.
You didn't listen to the second rule.
We've been set up.
Let's get out of here before we get ourselves killed.
Okay. Hi. There's so many of you.
Okay.
- Hi, guys. Hi.
- Uh, okay.
What are you doing?
They gonna kill us anyway.
- He's not with us!
My mustache fell off when they threw me through that window.
Mercury has...
Damn!
All my space facts are gone, Neal!
Tell me everything.
Did you rub it in Ramona's face yet?
Uh, things didn't exactly work out.
Ramona tricked us into going to a biker bar, and...
Come on, Cooper.
Tell everybody what you're really thinking.
What am I really thinking?
"Uh, the reason I don't listen to your ideas, Neal, is "because the one time that I do, we get outsmarted by a rival "and thrown through a window.
"Maybe, Neal, instead of complaining "that you don't get enough credit, you should acknowledge
"that I'm the brains of the operation. Just sit your nerdy face down in front of a computer!"
- Easy, Cooper.
- "And you, you big bastard, get your ass back in the kitchen and handle the product!"
You know what, Cooper, you've gone too far!
I'm out!
- I hope you're happy.
- I didn't even say anything.
Okay, I don't even know who's yelling at who here, but we need to focus on Ramona.
So there's no truth to what I said?
- Well, it was your plan. But...
- Oh, my God.
Some words you can't take back, Cooper!
You have to go after Neal.
Don't you see?
Dividing you guys like this, this is exactly Ramona's plan.
I think you're giving her a little too much credit.
- Hey, Neal.
- Oh, my God.
I heard you're unhappy with Cooper.
Mm. Yeah, it's not going well.
You should've heard the things he said to me.
You know that I think you're incredibly impressive and that I value what you do.
What is it that I do?
The viral marketing.
Your Web site. The entire database you set up was brilliant.
Your idea for Pajama Tuesdays.
Full disclosure, I just didn't feel like wearing clothes that day.
We could really use your skills at HangEnder. And... this would be your starting salary.
I'm sorry, is this some sort of joke?
I mean, Cooper and I are best friends.
I'm not gonna let one little petty f...
This is HangEnder.
- You've reached Neal Fissley's office.
- Oh, Louise?
Can you confirm my massage will be on a table and not one of those airport chairs?
And, uh, I'm out of lollipops, so... thank you.
I can't let her get away with taking Neal.
I'll help you get her back, but it could get ugly.
She pulls a knife, you pull a gun.
She puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of hers in the morgue.
Oh, I've been dying to use that line from The Untouchables since '87. May not have been worth it.
It's not about revenge, okay? It's about business.
And if I want to succeed, I got to beat Ramona at her own game.
Well, what are you prepared to do, Cooper?
- That's not helpful. - Welcome to the Rock.
- Hello, Ramona.
- Hey, Cooper.
If you're looking for a job, I'm afraid Neal's
- already hired an assistant.
- That's not why I'm here.
Oh, good, because the girl who got the job
- is way more qualified than you.
- If you're done,
I have a little proposal for you:
you give me Neal back, and I'll forgive the attack on my company and I promise
Counterproposal:
I keep Neal, bankrupt your company, and you come back to my place and we get rid of the sexual tension between us.
Interesting idea.
Let me consider/fantasize about that for a second.
Not gonna lie, that was amazing. But I still have to reject your offer.
I have lots of mirrors, and I had a terrible childhood.
Listen, Ramona, you have no idea what you're up against.
I think I have a pretty good idea.
You may have Neal, but I have a better product.
And I still have Barry Sandel.
I wanted to discuss... Look, I know why you're here and I'm not interested.
But if you could just hear me out for one second, I think...
It's my grandmother's sweat and tears in this cure, okay?
Literally. That's the two main ingredients.
Look, I know Cooper likes to hog all the credit and he called me a big bastard, but at the end of the day, we are still friends.
Our break room has a milkshake machine.
This is HangEnder. Barry Sandel's office. HangEnder rules!
Why am I seeing the bottom of my lollipop jar?
- Thank you. - All right, Josh, let's get ugly.
Coyote ugly.
It was on after The Untouchables.
Weird double feature.
Starz is the best.
- All right, let's go.
- We should've gone with my plan.
- Oh, yeah. Three stink bombs and a "Ramona Sucks!" banner.
You know what, we'll do that right after we TP her house and leave a bag of poo on the front step.
I love that. One tweak: fire.
Just whipping up tons of the cure for Bev Con.
It's a beverage conference.
"Our company"?
You're the only one left in your company. Okay, I don't need those guys. I was doing everything anyway.
I can't read Barry's writing. Does this say "cinnamon" or "cyanide"?
You should probably just assume cinnamon.
Oh, oh, oh. Check it out.
♪ Dun, dun, dun ♪
- Jelly beans.
What's in this one?
Gummy worms!
Josh, can we just focus?
I need you to... chop up 400 onions and then, uh, throw half of them away.
- It's Barry's process, so...
Cooper, the reason you got into this company is so you could build something great with your friends.
Maybe you should go and apologize.
They made their choice.
I came here because Cooper is too stubborn...
I came here because Cooper is too stubborn to tell you how much he needs you guys.
And you need him.
I don't need anything except for my milkshakes delivered freezing cold!
I'm talking 32 degrees Fahrenheit, Scottie, okay?
That's Fahrenheit!
- Guys,
Ramona doesn't value your ideas.
She just brought you here to undermine Cooper.
I went and looked at your offices... you don't even have computers!
Yeah, 'cause our assistants take dictation... of our lunch orders and our dreams and cool inventions that we have.
That's the spirit.
Ramona, Kelly seems to you think that we're just pawns and that you actually don't value our ideas. That's ridiculous.
Okay, name one of them.
Like the commercial we did about the girls in bikinis talking to girls in bikinis. Bikini-bikini.
No. That's terrible.
- I worked two days on that.
- That was cream of the crop.
Okay, fine, you're pawns.
But you're well-paid pawns with offices and assistants.
Due to recent events, this milkshake has become less delicious.
It's still a free milkshake.
- You guys are worse than Cooper.
And he's the worst.
Cures your hangover.
Yes, HangEnder ends the hang in the hangover, in the hangover.
- HangEnder!
HangEnder!
Just stay in Cooper's eyeline and remember...
Don't touch anything.
Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure is made from an age-old recipe.
Comes straight from a real grandmother who used to get hungover quite a bit, so...
Okay, just, uh...
So how many cases do you guys want?
Guys, I'm really going to need you to step it up.
We're working for free. And I'm drunk from the hard lemonade booth.
Would you like brochures?
You were right.
Cooper, we're kind of busy right now.
Okay, understood.
just as long as we...
Call Scottie and set up an appointment.
Everyone.
Welcome, everyone.
As you all know, hangover cures are becoming a billion dollar industry, and we've got the best one in the business.
My wonderful team has worked tirelessly to bring you this incredible video that will introduce you to our brand. A video?
HangEnder was founded by President and CEO Ramona Miller in 2011 after a bachelorette party gone wrong in Las Vegas.
Oh, yeah, they're happy.
- She looks good.
- HangEnder is made from only the freshest and natural ingredients.
Fresh berries, figs, pubic hair, filth from humans and pig's poop.
Ramona Miller does not care about black people.
I love black people.
Oh, that's not okay.
Turn it off. Turn it off! And...
Hangover Cures for life.
Move out of the way!
Get out of here.
- It's the best.
Who came up with that?
What are you talking about?
We did.
Of course you did.
- That was a great idea, man.
- That was amazing.
All right, let's get back to work. Let's get back to work.
- Oh, hi. Come on, come on, come on. - Gather round, gather round.
This has no pubic hair in it.
No poo.
I just wanted you to meet my new best girlfriend, Renee.
My name is Shawna.
We have tons in common and we're pretty much inseparable besties.
Uh, you must be Josh.
No. No that one. Kelly.
Did you meet Renee?
Look at her.
You're so lucky.
Ramona turned out to be, like, a ruthless shark, but she got hers.
So you and Ramona aren't friends anymore?
You're free to hang out?
- Yeah, of course.
Renee, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
It's Shawna.
Girls can be so clingy.
So, working with friends... It can be hard but it can be done.
Are you, uh, here to apply for the bartender position?
No, I came to congratulate you guys on Bev Con and to ask how you'd feel about joining forces.
- Absolutely not.
- She's crazy.
- Welcome to the Rock.
The bottom line is you guys have the better product but you don't have the resources to get it out there.
I do and I think together we'd be unstoppable.
What do you say?
I have to ask my partners.
So don't be afraid to team up with the people you love the most, because when it comes to work, it's always wise to keep your friends close...
Let's do it.
Good call. ...and your enemies closer.
Through Hallyu, the yearly export surplus on general merchandise is 27 trillion won.
Money. Everything is turned into money.
Theddukbokkiwe ordinarilyeat onthestreet isenjoyedlikeafirstrateItalianpastawhichisordered to eat.
At the moment they put the ddukbokki, a top star ate in a drama, into their mouths:
(In Japanese) It's delicious!
(In Japanese) It's awesome, isn't it?
They have fallen for Korea now.
I can't be in love with you (french)
I've never seen something like that.
They are in love with our Korean TV dramas.
(In Japanese) You're in the way!
Even Japan, the country which gave the degradation of colonization for 36 years.
The country that considers the land of Koguryeo as their land - China.
The country of Ghenghis Khan, who succeeded in winning the largest territory in world history - Mongolia.
(In Mongolian) Got it!
Dramas of no other country but Korea!
They are crazy about our dramas.
Cut scene!
Did you just spit on me?
Sorry, sorry.
Director, I can't work like this.
To catch just one percent in the viewer ratings...
Just a bit.
Our dramas, which the whole world is watching.
Money!
Anthony Kim Empire Production Representative
Because they turn into money.
M-O-N-E-Y.
To make a drama that turns into money we need to use a writer who makes money.
The cost for the castings is only 86 billions, 950 millions and 41 won.
With rounding it up, it's 87 billion won (US$87 million). And out of a total of 29 dramas that were aired I made 27 a success.
I'm moving within the accurate probability.
And that probability is exactly made by my hand.
Everyone, can you tell me what a drama is?
A drama is a war with numbers.
Representative, you said that out of your total 29 dramas, 27 succeeded.
Then, what is the reason why the other two dramas failed?
That means that the dramas you will make in the future can possibly fail too.
Ah, of course, you're right.
I'll absolutely never fail.
Therefore people call the ring I'm wearing "Lord of the Rings,"
and they call me the "King of Dramas." Everybody, the third-class people change the world, and the first-class... enjoys that world.
Representative, what is the secret of your success?
Representative!
You've already extended the term of the loan for 10 million won (US$10,000) four times.
Your address is still the same, right?
You're a drama writer?
Lee Go Eun "Elegant Revenge," a secondary writer.
I really like dramas.
What have you written?
Elegant Revenge.
Elegant Revenge?
Wow! It's the last day, today!
I'm a huge fan!
I had no idea such a young person was the writer of that drama.
I'm... just a secondary writer.
By secondary writer, you run errands... Well, I also run errands, but the real work I do... Anyway, I think you wrote your job incorrectly.
Strictly speaking, you're not a writer.
No, but being a secondary writer is a tough job.
Anyway, fix it.
This is wrong, too.
You have to write "jobless".
Therefore, I'm not jobless!
I've paid that dirty expensive interest without missing even once, and made your bank gain profit!
I got the loan from the bank, not from you, Ajumma! I don't have much time now, so before pulling out my dirty temper, process this one. QUICKLY!
Except for the last 10 minutes of this final episode, we've sent all the rest of the tapes to be edited.
Managing Director Oh Jin Wan Empire Production's #2 person The shooting team is now standing by at Samcheok, Gangwondo.
And 10 hours...
There are only ten hours left until the broadcast!
Writer Jeong said she can't write.
Can't write?
She said she can't write about that orange juice as PPL (product placement advertisement), so the script for the last part isn't done yet.
So, how much percent?
So how much percent of the probability to miss the broadcasting time?
Well, I'm not so good at math...
I majored in Literature, so...
There's not enough time.
Jeong Hong Joo Elegant Revenge's main writer, a career 20-yr veteran.
[Mad dog in Cheongdamdong] Yes, Writer Jeong, You're working hard even in this situation that the time is exactly money.
Working hard?
I'm writing this, not even eating a proper meal!
That's why I sent 10 packs of fresh, exceptional orange juice.
Haven't you tasted it yet?
Representative Kim... It's a classy and suitable juice for you, a writer getting paid 20 million won per episode.
This is the scene that our main character will die elegantly after finishing his revenge.
So does it make sense for him to drink orange juice there?
Writer, you know the hitter with a legendary rate, Yang Joon Hyeok of the Samsung Lions.
When there was a rumor about trading him to another team, he said;
"In my body, blue blood is running!" (Samsung Lions uniform's color)
This is a sentence of faith for him to keep his loyalty to the team.
Writer Jeong, right now, in my body, yellow blood is running. (without honorifics)
Is it so difficult to make the main character drink orange juice?
What?
Did you just talk down to me?
Would I only talk down to you? I can kick you out too, Writer Jeong!
How dare you kick me out?
I'm Jeong Hong Joo!
Dramas may be art to you for all I know, but to me they are business.
What if I don't?
This isn't a request.
This is the order from the owner who hired you.
Orange?
Orange juice my ass!
I'm back!
You, seriously... !
Go Eun, does this make sense?
The main character who is about to have a heroic death dies after drinking the orange juice of PPL(product placement advertisement)? Does it make sense?
What kind of crazy guy would do this?
-Who else...
The Cheongdamdong Crazy Dog.
Elegant Revenge Final Episode, the end.
Go Eun...
Correct any typos and send it to them.
Oh, Teacher...
What did you do with that orange juice?
The real artist should not compromise for a dirty shoppy businessman.
You've worked really hard, too.
Then, I'm leaving now.
Even so, what should I say if the production company calls?
Tell him that I'm gone under the water.
(implying "disconnect all contact lines")
Okay... go carefully.
Representative, the ending has just arrived.
The phone you called is not available now... Representative, it's already 1:30PM.
Why don't you just tell them to feed that orange juice to the actors and shoot the final scene?
Where did that orange juice come from?
Before the main character dies, where did he get it from so that he drinks it?
Ah, well... that...
But, about that... It was exposed 7 times, and one of them should be at least 10 seconds. For that, we got 300 million won ($300,000).
From the location to the description, dialogue, entire scene needs to be corrected.
But... now we have only 8 and half hours until the on-air time.
If Writer Jeong says she can't write it, what else can we do?
Yes, Chairman.
According to Chief Moon, the ending tape hasn't even arrived yet.
Please don't worry, tonight's show will be aired without any problem.
At this rate, what if the broadcasting accident (going blank) happens?
I am Anthony.
I worried for nothing.
I forgot for a moment that you are Anthony.
After the show is finished, I will report back to you.
I'll talk to you later.
Representative, what should we do?
What is the secondary writer's name?
Lee Go Eun.
That's right, I'm Anthony Kim.
Teacher isn't here.
Representative?
Actually, a moment ago, Writer Jeong had a car accident.
Teacher?
She was on her way back to here, as she promised to correct the script.
But at the intersection right over there, she had a three-car rear-end collison.
Th...
Then is Teacher... okay?
Don't worry, I've checked on her getting rest and falling asleep at ER with my own eyes.
Which hospital is it?
Before Writer Jeong fell asleep, she asked you, Miss Lee Go Eun, to correct the script.
She said that you're a very competent writer, who is like her other half.
But... what did she say to correct....?
What do you mean, "what"? Of course, it's about the orange juice.
That orange juice... she said I should write that?
Yes, right.
You need to correct that orange juice scene.
There is no way that Teacher told me to do so.
She also said that you would answer like that.
Then, from the location to stage direction and dialogue of the characters...
Up to the scene that the character dies after drinking the orange juice.
You're saying she said that I should correct all of them?
That's why I came here personally, not just called, although I'm so busy now.
Do you... think I'm telling a lie?
N-No.
We don't have much time...
START WRITING!
The time... time's running out.
Writer Jeong said that there is a pretty good one among your practice scripts.
Ah, "Morning of Kyeong Seong"?
The touching story with the background of the Japanese occupation era.
Y-Yes.
Writer Jeong told me to see that right away.
Please bring that to the company tomorrow.
If you finish this one well, you can debut with the next show.
I guarantee you.
Debut...
While we're going, you should write the scene and send it to the team.
Then... now...
We're going to the filming location in Samcheok.
Think well, how we can make the story that the main character drinks the orange juice and die.
The issue here is where he gets the orange juice from.
The construction site!
The last revenge place for the main character is happening in the construction site, scene #68.
Action scene in between the orange juice boxes...
- Orange juice bottles rolling and falling down!
- Picking up the orange juice?
- So then the ending...
- Drink it.
Bang! -Okay, we'll go with that.
Oh, Director Hong! Leave the camera rails as they are, we've just sent you the corrected script for scene #66 and #67.
Ah, you send the script for scene #66 and #67?
The main character's phone scene at the hospital, cut it at the phone booth nearby.
The hospital and cut? Yes. Move, MOVE, QUICKLY!
Orange juice boxes and the distribution center, I'm working on it now.
Once the shooting is done, move from the beach..... and take the road, 520m to the North from where you are.
Road?
I told you the distribution center.
There is one deserted storage unit.
Hurry up to rent that place and set up that place as close to the distribution center as possible and shoot there.
How much time to get there?
Yes, we'll arrive at 7:04PM.
We'll be there in 2 hours and 35 minutes.
Check the script in 3 seconds.
Managing Director Oh, call the broadcasting station and let them send a helicopter.
- A helicopter?
Also arrange a quick service motorbike from the shooting site to the helicopter.
Ah, y-y-yes!
Scene #69 is done!
Send it first by e-mail and move on to the next scene!
Well, hurry up, please!
We don't have much time.
It's the end!
Prepare it quickly!
Hey! Isn't the smoke too much, huh?
- The script is here!
- Okay, okay! Okay...
We'll move to the next location!
Here is the next script.
What... ?
The final ending?
We still don't have it.
Then what are we supposed to do?
What time is it?
Yes, it's... 5.. 5:27PM.
HEY!
MOVE, MOVE, QUICKLY! GO!
Go! HEY, move all the equipment and go!
Representative, the final ending... So, how many minutes for its running time in M Broadcasting?
It's 65 minutes and 20 seconds.
M Broadcasting Engineer Anthony's planted spy.
Just now, Director Jeong went to the control room with the tape.
Let's make one more scene.
Isn't it too fake?
Yesterday's rating was 24%, but how can it be over 30% even if I write one more scene?
The possibility that viewers will change the channel to another drama after watching their favorite drama is usually 52.3%.
Moreover, our drama will have it's final episode today.
The possibility that viewers will watch our drama at the moment of one and half minutes when other dramas are finished?
82.7%.
But... after killing off all characters, there is only one scene left, where the main character will die alone, so what story can I make more...?
So, that's your job anyway. In this situation when we don't even have time to shoot the additional scene, if we have to add one more scene?
Should we go with flashback scene?
That's correct!
Yes, Representative. Among the scenes we've filmed before, please edit one flashback scene quickly which possibly comes in mind of the main character, right before he dies.
Flashback?
It will be inserted right before the ending scene.
Running time should be about one and half minute.
Yes, I got it!
Representative, look at this.
"main character, walking with a pack of orange juice..." "drinking orange juice," "orange juice"
Okay, let's go with that.
The last script arrived!
Move, move!
The rest, get out!
Good, good, the last scene. Once we're done with this, it's done!
From now on, the war is started.
Read-y-y-y-y!
The Representative came.
They are doing the final scene.
Orange juice close-up!
Let's shoot the close-up of the orange juice!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
I've filmed it as you told me to do, but from here to Seoul, it takes at least 4 hours.
There are less than 3 hours till the on-air time.
Don't worry, the helicopter will be used.
Excuse me, Representative. I've just got a message, but because of the bad weather in Seoul, the helicopter can't come.
You useless bastard!
What about the quick-service motorbike?
Well, he's over there.
PD Park, wrap it one more time.
How much are you earning for a month?
About 2 million won ($2,000).
Think you can do it?
Director Park, lend me that motorcycle.
Representative?
From here to Seoul, 293.8 km. (about 160 miles) The possibility that biker goes in 300km per hour and arrives there alive is 36.2%.
If he and I, two of us go... it's 72.4%.
Representative Kim!
You can die!
Anyway, life is 50:50.
I can't ruin my life because of that half. What I'm afraid of more than death, it's failure.
The script is here, here (in your brain), so to edit the scenes, you should come with me!
Even at this moment while you're hesitating, the possibility is getting lower, bit by bit.
Get on...
Oh, Director!
The tape... has the tape arrived?
They say it's on its way.
Lee Seong Jo (Elegant Revenge's Present CP) Moon Sang Il (S Broadcasting Station's Drama Director) Until the air-time, now there are only 30 minutes left.
Kim Byeong Seok (S Broadcasting Station's Deputy Drama Director) Nam Woon Hyeong (S Broadcasting Station's CP)
I-Is this 911?
The place is... There is an accident at Route #7, Kangreung junction, near the ramp toward Yeongdong Highway.
It's a motorbiker, and the condition is serious.
Are you crazy? If we leave him like that, he will die, he will!
What on earth is a drama to you so that it's more important than a person's life?
So what can I do at this moment? !
In this field, you should throw away everything else for a drama!
Director... he's not picking up the phone.
It has already been 33 minutes since the show has started!
You're the CP in charge of this show, but are you out of your mind? Hey, this is not a regular episode, but the final episode! The final one!
Have you ever seen a final episode without it's ending?
Well.. that...s... Even if you have to use a satelite, find out where he is now! Director!
The tape has arrived.
Director, they just started the editing.
How many minutes are left until the ending?
Yes, 5 minutes and 20 seconds left.
Will they be able to edit within the time?
They must do even if they all die.
Before this scene, the main character rides a motorbike to go to the distribution center.
They must have filmed it all together at the end.
Let's cut it and paste it.
Director, the rating is continuously rising.
How many more minutes are left?
Yes, 2 minutes and 50 seconds left.
Now, we have only 15 seconds.
Hurry, hurry!
Director... the dramas of other broadcasting stations are all done for today.
The time of death... November 5th, 2010.
30.9%!
Director!
We're the highest one!
Hey, you did a good job.
You've worked hard!
Good, good!
You asked me earlier what on earth a drama is.
This is the drama we make.
They say that people make a condolence call when the dog of a Prime Minister dies, but not when that Prime Minister actually dies.
What you say now means... the mother, of the Minister of Culture and Tourism, is a dog?
I didn't mean that...
All the real dogs are gathered over there.
Mutts which got wind of food smell in the party and came to get the food.
Representative, yesterday's quick-service rider... passed away at the end.
Sorry to hear that.
That damn motorbike!
I'll crush that right away!
Calm down, Sister-in-law.
Let go of me, Brother-in-law!
To earn those few pennies of money, my husband died.
How can I calm down now....?
But what can we do now?
Life goes on anyway.
This shouldn't have happened.... Calm down, Sister-in-law....
How can I live now... ?
Go Eun's mother, please calm down.
Do you think I can calm down now?
We bought a boat to go fishing, not to kill my husband! Let go of me! Let go of me!
Don't cry.
What can I do....?
Please! Please!
Because of the motorbike, I lost my husband.
What shall I do....?
What will I do for my child?
In the name of Jesus, Amen.
She must be resting in peace, embraced by Lord.
Thank you, Representative Kim.
Oh, you're here.
Representative Kim, congratulations.
Drama Director of K Broadcasting. Drama Director of M Broadcasting.
You've continued the legend of "Empire" with an unbeaten performance.
Oh, thank you.
This time, because of the rating of your "Elegant Revenge", we've had really hard time.
Your next one will be done with us, right?
I was going to visit you next week.
Good, good. Let's have a meal next week, for sure.
With me, what about a round of golf on this Saturday?
Uh, oh, what are you talking about now?
Representative Kim, you should do your next show with us again, okay?
You must be busy, so you can leave.
Yes, then I will take my leave now.
- Such a jerk!
- What a rude bastard!
Right now, he's hot. But some day, he will fall.
When it comes, let's step on him surely.
All the directors are so impatient now.
Yes, they are, so that they can rush to step on me once I misstep.
[Eun Yi's Grilled Mackerel]
Please give us more side dishes.
Please give us one more grilled mackerel.
Ah, yes.
Oh, you're here!
Madame Kang!
Hey, what's up with you?
I'm so busy now.
Did you grill mackerel well with saulty flavor?
I earned money with saulty flavor!
Here, one more grilled mackerel, please!
Hurry up, go put your bag inside and come out again.
Mom, by the way...
I have to send a script to the production company tonight, so please let me skip tonight.
Then, will they pay you?
Of course! Once I debut, they will pay me.
Got it!
Go inside and earn money!
Hello, this is Writer Jeong Hong Joo.
If you leave a message, I will call you back.
Teacher, this is Go Eun.
I couldn't reach you, so I'm leaving a message again.
Are you still at the hospital?
You're alright, right?
Did you see the last episode of "Elegant Revenge"?
I tried hard to modify the script. Thanks to you, I got the chance to debut.
Although I should thank you in person... Anyway, please give me a call.
It's cancelled.
To leave a message, please press 1.
To leave a phone number, please press 2.
Teacher, please give me a call.
I'm so worried, and I have something to tell you in person too.
Please give me a call.
The message is saved.
[Morning of Kyeongseong]
Writer :
[Funeral Home] Representative, no matter how much I think over and over, I think you'd better not go in there....
By the way... how do you know my brother....?
At the accident site, I was there with him.
Then, the person who reported to 911...?
I'm also the one who requested the last delivery of the deceased.
That's why the accident happened unintentionally.
Then, you are.... the reason why my husband died...?
You bastard!
What's the reason you came all the way here and say such things?
After killing my brother, how dare you show up here!
Please calm down, please!
If it were you, do you think you can calm down now?
Yes, yes, yes.
I thought it's the right thing for me to tell you the exact situation why the deceased passed away.
What's the use of such money? My husband is dead now, so what's the use of it!
? Even so, don't you think you gave them too much?
It's from your personal account.
Well, I feel sorry for them too, but actually you don't have any legal responsibility.
And he chose it on his own too.
I don't think there is any reason for you to do that much...
Some one died while working for my drama.
And I'm in charge of that drama.
Is there any other reason needed?
Ah...no.
But, are you really alright?
Don't worry. The drama is finished, and starting tomorrow, for another drama,
I will become a bad jerk again.
What can I help you with?
I came for an appointment with Representative Kim.
Your name is...?
I'm Lee Go Eun, a secondary writer for "Elegant Revenge".
He told me to come here once.
Ah, yes...
Ah, yes, I will send you that right away.
Ah, yes, thank you for loving our drama, yes.
So, let's stop there, after you;ve knocked down all of them, I mean.
After finishing them, you will stop the motion, right there!
And (breathing hard) the sweat will run down, and then, cut! This is it! This is the great one!
Miss Lee Go Eun?
Representative Kim is out of his office for a moment.
Please wait inside for a moment
C.E.O. Anthony Kim
What brought you here?
Yes, you told me before.... Oh, you did a good job before.
I came here because you told me before to bring my practice script.
Oh, that's right.
I've prepared this one for 3 years.
It's a historical drama with 20 episodes, and I wrote the script and synopsis up to 4 episodes...
I got it.
I will contact you after reading them.
Anything else? Yes, by any chance, which hospital is it that Teacher Jeong is admitted?
"Teacher Jeong"...?
I mean Writer Jeong Hong Joo.
- Anthony!
- I told you he's not in the office now.
Oh, she's here now.
So, it was you? I was wondering which bastard dared to touch my script, but it was you!
Teacher, what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
HEY! I brought a country girl from Busan, and taught and raised for 5 years, but now you dare to put your knife on your teacher's script?
Ah, wait!
What do you mean "put my knife"?
I did it because I was told that you asked me to do it!
Who, who, WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
I know, right?
I was attending church. You came to me personally and offered to modify the script, and in return, you brought your own script and asked me to read it.
But how come you blame me now?
What did you say?
So, your goal was to debut, I see.
No, that's not true!
No, Teacher! I'm really wronged now!
HEY!
Here is the obvious evidence, but how can you say it's misunderstanding?
I'm going to bury you in this drama industry field.
Ah, Teacher!
No, it wasn't me! I'm saying it wasn't me!
Why on earth are you doing this to me?
"What do you mean?"
All my efforts with blood and sweat, built for the last 5 years, became nothing at once, but you're saying "what do you mean?"
As promised, I will read your script and if it's good, I'll contact you.
Do you think I will believe that?
Miss Lee Go Eun.
Do you know what is really innocent?
Focusing on the goal.
Whether it's money or success, I just focused on it innocently.
Representative! Are you alright?
I'm fine, so just clean that up.
"Morning of Kyeongseong"? Japanese occupation era, in the wheels of history, a fierce life story of one man, who threw his identity away and risked his destiny.
Genre :
Noir
It's a dark story which only costs a lot of money.
Didn't it spill on your clothing?
Get rid of this too!
Ah, Representative, the meeting is ready now.
We have a big problem!
Drama "Elegant Revenge" which put a 40-year-old man to death.
What are you all doing now?
Actively explain and block all the media!
Immediately!
Yes, hello? Oh, Reporter Park, wait a second.
Call Lawyer Park and let him prepare the press release for the explanation.
Who ordered this "speeding of death"? / Netizens, furious about the production company's C.E.O. / Even bribed the deceased's family... / Empire Production's cover-up for the accident?
Chief Editor Yoon Dae Sung of Daehan Daily is on the line 1.
Yes, Chief, this is Anthony.
Oh, Representative Kim, what has happened?
Yes, I will tell you more details later.
Chief, please block the articles first, though.
We will give you the press release soon for explanation or refutation. All other newspapers are putting up the story now, so we can't take it out alone!
I will take care of other companies too, so please take that out immediately for now.
That's, well.. Ah, Representative Kim, I need to go for a meeting, so I will call you back a little later.
Chief, Chief!
C.E.O. Kim Jong Chul of Yonhop Entertainment News is on the line 3.
Hello, this is Anthony!
We're also preparing the explanation press release, so you don't have to worry about it.
Please remove the articles now.
That's why I'm asking your favor.
You know I've helped you a lot so far, Chief.
This time, it's your turn to help me, Chief.
You shouldn't do this to me, Chief.
Team Leader Park, we've been partners for 5 years, you know that, right?
I'll not ask any more.
Only three days, please block it for three days.
Hello, hel...?
Have you forgotten who helped you to your current position? Hello, hel...? Have you forgotten who helped you to your current position?
Are you done talking?
Hey, you bastards!
I'm the one who has given you money and articles so far!
Right now, reporters are waiting in front of the company and requesting the interview.
Representative, Mr. Chairman is on the line.
Speaking, Mr. Chairman.
Anthony, I'm really disappointed by you.
I'm sorry. Until tomorrow, the press release for refutation will be on and...
No need to say anything further.
Attend the meeting tomorrow for the Board of Directors.
Mr. Chairman...
Please give me some time to solve this.
I don't care about other people, but at least you should trust me.
I'm not saying I don't know how you feel.
But shouldn't I clean up the mess you made?
You're doomed now.
What do you mean "doomed"?
Who made "Empire Production" company as the number one in Asia?
How could you say I'm doomed?
Because of me, "Empire" is made.
The fame of "Empire" is made because of me, Anthony!
Even if I have to leave, I will leave with my own feet.
But I can't just leave.
The writers I've raised, I will leave with them all.
So are you saying you will fight till the end? You know well, that baseball is dependent on a pitcher, and a drama is dependent on a writer.
Fine. If you want, go ahead.
I don't think you have much time, though, because I won't stay still.
Don't regret.
Secretary Choi.
Starting from Top Writer Lee Mi Hun, Writer Kim, Writer Park, all others, put them through.
I've read the article very well.
As I told you, you've put even the photo really neatly.
What can he do now?
I'm not the only one who wishes that bastard goes under.
Managing Director, Mr. Chairman is on the line.
I will call you later again.
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Since we don't have much time, listen carefully to what I'm about to say, Director Oh.
- I fired Anthony a minute ago.
You can do that, right?
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
I'll definitely finish this. Secretary Kim, before Anthony, put Writer Lee Mi Hun through, and transfer all the lines, which Secretary Choi put through to Anthony, to me!
If you come with me, I will give you 40 million won.
Writer Park is on the line 2.
Then, please don't hang up, and think it through for a moment.
Secretary Choi, what about Writer Lee (Mi Hun)?
I couldn't reach her yet.
By all means, put her through.
Yes, Writer Park, this is Anthony.
40 million won?
Writer Kim, Anthony is fired now, so he's calling the number without thinking.
What will you do with the penalty for breach of the contract with "Empire", then?
Ah, you don't need to concern about the penalty for breach of the contract.
I will get the investment and handle it right away. You know me well, I'm Anthony.
I admit that Anthony is good and resouceful. Yes, I admit that.
But, haven't you heard about Writer Jeong?
"Elegant Revenge" was mutilated by Anthony.
What do you mean "mutilated"?
It had the rating 30.2% and was placed as the top.
I will treat you as a national writer, Writer Park.
What about 50 million won per episode?
Then, please don't hang up, and think it through, yes.
Secretary Choi, what about Writer Lee?
We didn't request that side... Hey, excuse me!
Ah, yes, yes, I got it.
I will give you more time to think about it.
Writer Lee is on the line 1.
Then, please don't hang up, I will wait for your answer.
You.. you... you!
What on earth are you?
I'm Lee Go Eun who screwed up in this field because of YOU!
[Preview]
What I'm mad the most is that such a kind like you is acting up with the power in drama production field.
You will be doomed some day.
I've always lived a fancy life.
Of course, it's not like that there was no shadow in my life.
By any chance, do you have about 3 million won ($3,000)?
The problem is that the shadow has been...
Are you in that much difficulty?
continued since 3 years ago.
Oh, I guess you have something to get some investment from Japan.
About 10 billion won...?
- About 10 billion won...?
- 10 billion won?
Lee Go Eun, Lee Go Eun... Yes, the name was definitely Lee Go Eun... Go Eun, don't you want to make a drama?
Is this Writer Lee Go Eun?
BE QUIET, PLEASE!
King of dramas, Anthony can stand up again. To conquer the world again, I need you,
Lee Go Eun!
Episode 2 TheFallof theLord Y-Y-You! What on earth are you?
I'm Lee Go Eun who is screwed up in the industry because of YOU! This is the most critical moment in my life. Beat it!
Because of money... you screwed up what's most important, my life! What are all of you doing? Get her out of here!
Please leave.
I'll leave here when I'm ready. What I'm angry about the most is that my life has disintegrated because of you, a third-rate bottom feeder.
What I'm mad the most about is... that such a person like you is acting up with the power in the drama production field.
You... will be doomed one day. By someone like you.
Yes, Writer Lee. It's me, Anthony.
If you, Writer Lee, is the top of "Empire", that means you're the top nationally.
But the fact that the money you're paid per episode was not the top level has always troubled me.
I will make you the most.
How about 60 million per episode?
Representative Kim, I get your meaning.
I'm driving right now.
Let's talk about it later.
Ah, I need to go to a meeting.
Instead of just hanging up, can you consider it?
I'm begging you, Writer Lee.
Alright, then please give me 15 minutes.
Yes, I got it.
Let's do that.
Writer Park, have you thought about it?
I'm sorry, Representative Kim. No matter how I think about it, I can't do it because of the breach of contract penalty.
I told you I'll take care of it at my end.
Writer Kim, have you thought about it? Representative Kim, I appreciate what you said.
Let's do it together next time.
There is no next time for my proposal.
Also, 40 million won per episode means total 800 million won! ($800,000). Rather than getting 800 million won for working like a dog,
I'd rather take 600 million won and work like the prime minister.
Writer Kim...
Shouldn't you apologize first before talking about nothing but money first?
Hey, Representative Kim, because of you, i've been recently living by taking sleeping pills.
How can you do that?
Since when did you respect me?
Representative Kim, haven't you been axed?
Axed?
I left on my own two feet.
That!
[Name #15] Jeong Hong Joo
[Name #1] Lee Mi Heon
It has to be Lee Mi Heon.
Only Lee Mi Heon.
Writer Lee, it's me, Anthony.
Writer Lee?
What should I do, Representative Kim?
Jeong...
Writer Jeong Hong Joo?
It's Jeong Hong Joo.
Were you expecting writer Lee Min Heon?
Right now, she is beside me.
Writer Jeong, right now, I'll apologize to you.
I'm really, really sorry.
Actually, I tried to immediately phone...
You needn't apologize.
You already know.
Everybody wished to see you crash and burn.
Anthony, you're completely washed up.
The Chairman said you should vacate the office right now.
3 Years Later...
The Representative has arrived!
You are here?
I've always lived a brilliant life.
In the brilliant life, there can be both the light and shadow.
Of course, it doesn't mean in my life, there are no shadows.
The problem here is that shadow has been continuously with me since three years ago until now.
Because I'm not a kind of person who is obsessive about the past.
And I dreamed my comeback again.
However, in the industry, I notice everyone quietly avoids me.
Even if my mother were to die, I am not a person who cries.
I don't want to cry. I cannot fathom why throughout the past three years, without a regular fixed pattern, it's like this.
I don't think it is the case that there is no pattern.
Whenever you feel anxious, you're touching your finger.
Three years ago, what is the story associated with that?
Although you are brushing it off with those words, it's not so within your mind.
Please, give me medicine. Because we've stopped your medication, we could find that (pattern) out.
But because I've stopped the medication, I'm crying again, aren't I?
I don't have any more medication. Please give me some more.
Relying on medication cannot cure the disease.
You want to find out what causes mental instability fundamentally...
So what is the percentage?
I'm asking what is the percentage of probability that I wouldn't cry without the medicine.
The probability that I wouldn't cry by taking the medication is 100%.
Please give me medicine.
Psychiatry
I will write a prescription for you.
But promise me, you will accept reality and overcome it.
That will be 50,000 won. (approx. $50)
It was declined.
You've arrived?
Yeah. Nothing really happened, right?
There is something that happened.
I really hate to tell you this, but... it's been months since I've last been paid.
I couldn't pay my credit card bill, so I'm getting the push call from the card company.
I hope you will pay me by this month.
I might be late so go home first.
Please leave well.
Ajussi, send us two sacks of rice.
Ahjumma!
Can I have another bottle of sesame oil?
Aigoo, you already used it all?
In here, please.
[Eun Yi's Grilled Mackerel]
The order is ready.
Mister! We're watching that, but how come you changed the channel?
Oh, please... you women...
Oh, seriously!
I was watching it too.
Change it to a drama.
Ahjussi, it's 3:1, you're the minority.
Please just have this delicious grilled mackerel, and concede the channel to them.
Oh, the moment is gone!
The fact that he was their son must have been revealed.
Look at his expression.
It's the hospital and she is shocked from looking at the test results.
Probably, the doctor would say, "As per the test, it's 99% matched."
As per the test, it's 99% matched.
Then, at this moment, the mom would cry out the name of the son.....
Ji Wan!
That's right, the son's name is Ji Wan, Ji Wan.
You're awesome.
How come you figure even the dialogue?
I know right.
You could become a writer.
You could really become a writer.
That's right, she's much better than the actual writer!
- Why are you serving the grilled mackerel here?
Geez. I think we must send her to the broadcasting station.
Why do you have so much to say if you came to eat some grilled mackerel?
Have you read that article?
I have. It was really epic.
Move the camera upwards and bam!
And camera #2 is coming in... Director Hong, long time, no see.
Have you been well?
Ah... hello.
Are you here to see Representative Oh?
I heard your contract with "Empire" is almost up.
You should work with me soon.
But promise me.
You must accept reality and overcome it.
That's a joke!
I have something to film so... uh... One, Two, Camera!
Representative OH JIN WAN
Proposal for a joint venture?
(A contract agreement between Jaekuk Entertainment and Watanabe Group written in Japanese)
Watanabe Group?
When is the appointment with Writer Jeong Hong Joo?
I'm sorry about the wait.
What are you doing that's making you that busy?
We were looking for some writers.
There are countless writers, but what have you done for the last 3 years, not making connection with them? Well then Sunbaenim, what brings you here without notice?
Do you have about $3,000 on you?
Are you having that much of a difficult time?
Do you not have even $3,000?
While I was coming here, I just hit another car slightly.
But the other person wanted to settle it in cash.
I was planning on giving him about $3,000 but I forgot my wallet at my company.
He must be waiting right now so just lend me the money since it's not that big of an amount.
I too, forgot my wallet.
Why don't you just call your insurance company?
Otherwise, you can get in trouble later.
There must be some investors from Japan right?
I saw that a minute ago while I was waiting.
I'm having such a hard time because of this.
Are they strict?
They say this Korean-Japanese is a pretty successful businessman in Japan, but he says that he wants to invest about 10 billion won ($10 million) to a Korean drama.
10 billion won?
Sunbaenim...
This is 10 billion won project.
Since we're a big company, a proposal in such scale comes.
Who would want to deal with a tiny company for this project?
If you are interested, you might as well try out for it.
The condition is simple.
The background of the drama should be Japanese occupation era.
Japanese occupation era?
He's saying that the drama should depict the fierce life story of a man, who's betting his destiny in the swirling sad history of the Japanese occupation era.
But how could we find a script like that all of a sudden?
I'm checking with the writer's group and also searching famous writers too, but all they wrote were not really satisfactory, so...
Ah, aish. Representative?
Are you okay?
Japanese occupation era, in the wheels of sad history, ...
Put them away.
Put these away.. Ah, yes. Ah, yes.
[Morning of Kyeongseong] This script, put that in the closet.
Oh, Director Oh.
Yes, sir. The scripts in that closet, throw all of them away.
For how many years have they been in there?
Get rid of them, including the closet.
Yes, I understand.
Sunbaenim?
Sunbaenim!
We should eat dinner together, but I have an appointment.
No, take care of business.
Hey... Mom, just talk... what is it?
Do you... ?
Are you setting me up again on a date?
Whose son is it going to be this time?
The veggie store?
The grocery store?
Or the seafood store?
Do you want to write dramas?
Do you want to write dramas... again?
I enjoy living my life earning money with you better.
And what do you mean we make a decent amount?
We need to save up money to buy a house. By grilling one mackerel at a time, in a thousand years?
I'll make it so that you'll be grilling 100 mackerels a day.
You're the last person to leave.
Yes, keep up the good work.
Have a good evening!
I wonder if they turned off all the lights...
Her name was Lee Go Eun.
[Morning of Kyeongseong]
Writer/ Lee Go Eun
Alright, this is good enough.
After adjusting a few things, it will become quite a thing.
I hope you take a liking to this piece of work.
World Production Representative...
Anthony Kim.
Writer/ Lee Go Eun 010.298.5983
Your grilled mackerel is ready.
Please enjoy.
Please enjoy the food.
We'll do the customer's reactions now.
Do you have to do this?
It's taking up several tables and the lunch crowd will be here soon!
Mom, do you know how many customers will come after doing this?
I told you I will make it so that you'll be grilling 100 mackerels a day.
We're ready to start.
Which one of you wants to be on camera?
Shall we do it from this side?
Or this side?
What's gotten into her?
[It is an international call.]
This is the Watanabe Secretary's office. Hello? This is the Watanabe Secretary's office.
Can I speak to Anthony Kim?
This is Anthony Kim of the World Production Company.
We can speak Japanese if you'd like.
Our Chairman read through the entire script that you sent.
He was deeply moved by it and wants to invest in it.
Can you come to Japan together with the writer?
The Chairman is in America right now on a business related trip.
You can come tomorrow to Japan with the writer.
Mr. Anthony Kim?
Yes, yes.
Will you be able to come tomorrow?
Yes, I understand.
We will provide your flight. See you then.
In that case, I will see you then.
What irks me the most is the fact that my life is ruined by a third-rate bottom feeders' crap such as you.
What makes me mad the most is the fact that jerks like you wield all the power in the drama production field.
You... will be doomed one day. By someone like you.
How about Writer Jeong?
After all, she worked under Writer Jeong for 5 years. She doesn't know, either?
Representative...
How about hiring a private investigator?
A private investigator?
You want me to find someone based on just the name of Lee Go Eun and her disconnected phone number.
In that kind of situation I charge five million.
Five million won? (around $4,600)
We have to find her in 5 hours.
If that's the case, then 8 million won.
If you don't like my price, you can go somewhere else.
Why don't you give it a thought.
Representative, how are we going to get 8 million won out of nowhere?
If you give them a discount, they'll take it for granted.
While the price is steep, he's not saying that it's impossible to do.
When food was scarce during the Enlightenment period, people started grilling mackerels instead of ribs.
Although in the present generation we have a lot of food...
Grilled mackerel?
It looks really delicious.
Eun Yi's Grilled Mackerel It's really delicious!
Well, what should we do?
Have you made up your mind?
Never mind.
I said never mind.
Rep...
Rep-Representative!
I'll give you a discount.
How about 7 million?
Seven million?
Aren't you coming?
Alright, 5 million.
What a deal. 5 million!
4.5 million!
4 million!
Or just even one million won!
Your mackerel is ready!
Enjoy!
Veggie refills, please.
Is my grilled mackerel ready yet?
Yes, just a minute.
Ah, hello!
Please wait for a bit.
That TV gig worked like a charm!
The real charm is in your grilled mackerels!
Please enjoy!
Yes, this is Eun Yi's Grilled Mackerel.
Can I speak with Writer Lee Go Eun?
Is Writer Lee Go Eun available?
I'm sorry, I can't hear.
Writer Lee Go Eun, is she available?
Yeah, that's me.
This is the drama production company "World Productions".
We were looking for a script for our next drama, and we happened to read your "Morning of Kyeongseong."
Everyone, be quiet for a minute!
Yes, you were saying?
Do you happen to be bound by a contract or production company?
No, thats not a problem.
Our company would like to make your "Morning of Kyeongseong" into a drama. What do you think?
My "Morning of Kyeongseong"?
Yes, if it's ok with you, I would like to meet with you today.
Where do I need to go to?
No, I will come to you.
Umm... Miss Lee Go Eun, it's been a while.
Have you been well since the last time I saw you?
Get out right now.
I said to get out.
Writer Lee...
I told you to get lost, you jerk!
Will you not let go?
I know that I made a mistake back then.
"Writer Lee"?
After kicking me out of the field of drama writing, you've got some nerves to call me "Writer Lee."
Because of you, I've been called a sell-out who backstabbed her mentor and other harsh names.
Because of you, my future as a writer was hopelessly crushed and utterly destroyed.
Three years have passed, and you just show up and want to produce my drama?
I'm sorry. I sincerely am.
That's why I've come here to apologize.
Three years ago, you seemed to think that my work was a worthless piece of crap.
Do you suddenly like it?
Because it's sincere.
Who are you trying to fool?
Yes, your script is crappy and mediocre at best, but it has some potential.
I'm after that potential.
I told you not to talk rubbish, just tell me the truth!
I got a rich geezer hooked on your script.
You... are really low.
Get lost.
Before getting lost, I'll just say one thing.
I don't know if you've heard, but I'm completely broke.
All I have is an overdrawn bank account and that crappy old car over there. I'm behind on my rent payment, too.
I can rise again.
The King of Dramas Anthony can rise again.
To conquer the world again, I... need you, Lee Go Eun.
don't need you.
So get out.
Didn't you hear what my kid said?
I guess making the daughter of me, Park Kang Ja, miserable three years ago wasn't enough for you.
If you don't want to die by my hand get out right now.
I'll say one more final word.
I told you to get out right now...
Hey... that guy said he would say just one more thing and then go.
Let's hear what he's got to say!
Yes, let's hear him out.
Fine, I'm a coldblooded, repulsive jerk. But what does that have to do with you?
What does me being a jerk have to do with you giving up your dream instead of pursuing it?
So you want to spend the rest of your life here serving mackerel?
Just be content with telling your child one day, "Your mother also used to have a dream once."
Dreams aren't there to be reminisced, but rather, to be fulfilled.
And the only chance to fulfill this dream will be gone after tonight.
It's okay if you hate me.
But don't do something you'll be sorry for, for the rest of your life.
Just stuff your faces with mackerels!
Good night. Mr. Kim, you had too many drinks tonight.
Another bottle of soju, please.
Please visit again!
The food was good!
Drive safely!
Oh, hello!
This was my last ray of hope after everything else has failed.
Will it all end this way?
Two more dishes of grilled mackerels, please.
Two more grilled mackerels.
Do you plan on living your entire life grilling mackerels like this?
And then are you going to tell your children that you had a dream at one point of your life?
Dreams aren't something to look back on when you grow older.
Dreams are there to be pursued.
It's fine if you hate me.
But just don't do something you will regret for the rest of your life.
You must pursue your dream.
Don't worry about mom.
Anyways, you ...
had no skill at grilling mackerels.
This is for the best.
Mom... Silly girl, I just fired you!
Fine, I can't back down like this.
You've made the right decision. I'll tell you two things. First,
I really hate people like you.
Nasty, dirty, greedy, soulless sell-outs.
You should keep that in mind.
Thank you.
I'm going to kill you for real. As long as you don't kill me painfully, please.
My mom also has a message for you.
If you make me cry one more time, she's going to slit your throat.
This is quite a tough family.
Fine. Now, it's my turn to talk.
You've got to watch your language, young lady.
Mind your tongue if you want to work with me.
I understand, Representative.
What would you like me to do?
Pack your bags and get in this car.
We're going to the airport.
Don't forget your passport.
Why the airport?
Why do you think? To take a plane, of course!
The man who thought your script was great, wants to meet you in Japan.
Anthony Kim-sama and Lee Go Eun-sama, it is an honor to have both of you aboard
Chairman Watanabe's personal airplane.
This plane is AIR-WK Number 501.
We plan to arrive on Hukuoka Airport at 2:15 P.M.
I hope this will be a comfortable trip for both of you.
Do you think I'll sign a contract without a contract fee?
Why don't you have a contract fee?
It's written right there.
That I will give you the money after I receive the investment fee.
You know my situation well enough.
Then why did you get on the plane?
Because I'm a villager from Busan who has never ridden a plane before.
What is that for?
It's your contract fee.
There's nothing more I can do even if you glare at me.
If you can't trust me, then don't believe me, believe Sejong (king on currency).
Where is your hotel?
Jae Guk hotel please.
You will be picked up tomorrow morning at 10.
Do you know how much it costs to spend a night here?
What's with him?
How much is a one-night stay here?
Ten thousand yen!
Can you give me a discount for two rooms?
No way, no way!
They only have one room.
It's already 8 o'clock.
Wake up now.
What kind of writer sleeps so much?
Being a girl, you grind your teeth and snore.
The president is waiting.
He's prepared a yacht and a car.
What kind of a person is Chairman Watanabe that he wants to fully fund the drama production?
He's a Korean-Japanese business man loaded with money.
So you're saying he looked at my script and liked it?
You wish.
You wouldn't even be here if I hadn't fudged the facts.
What did you tell him?
I told him to meet you in person.
Ne quid nimis (nothing in excess).
Too much fudging can backfire.
The only reason he's investing on this project is his trust in me, so don't make any mistakes and do well! so don't make any mistakes and do well!
He's a man after all,
The president has arrived.
This person is the writer?
Yes, she is Writer Lee Go Eun.
Reading your work brought back long-forgotten memories of my homeland and my days of youth.
As he read your work, he wondered whether this inexperienced rookie writer would be worth his investment.
The whole time I was reading your script, I was so moved by it, that I just had to see the writer in person.
The whole time he was reading, he saw plot holes here and there, but because he trusts producer Anthony he has decided to invest in our drama.
Did you conceive the idea for the script yourself?
He asked whether the story was your own idea.
Though I didn't experience this painful era of our history myself, Because she didn't experience this painful era of our history herself,
I wanted to write about the life of a man whose destiny was entwined around that tragic period.
Ah, so Anthony Kim is the writer's saviour.
Then, I will trust you Anthony Kim and your writer.
I will sign a contract with you.
What did he say? That based on his trust on the producer, Anthony, he will sign a contract with us!
Oh, thank you!
(In Japanese) Thank you.
I have one condition though.
Thi...this year?
Within this year, together with my beloved wife Akiko
I would like to watch "KyeongSeong's Morning."
Your wife...
She's very beautiful!
The only requirement for my investment in this production is that it needs to come out within this year.
Do you have a particular reason for wanting it to come out this year? I can't tell you that.
Can you promise me?
Mr. Anthony?
Within this year, I will definitely show you the drama.
Your word is not enough.
Once I get our drama assigned within this year's broadcast schedule, I will accept your investment.
How about that?
Let's sign the contract immediately, then.
I'll deposit a down payment of 1% within today.
And I will provide the investment money in three installments as stated in the contract.
This way, please.
We're really making my drama!
This isn't a dream, is it?
So giggly and happy over that?
Don't do anything rash and just focus on perfecting your script.
Just get it scheduled for broadcast this year, and I get 9.9 billion.
In total, 10 billion won!
I'm finally making a comeback.
My empire is all starting again!
I'll show you what I can do, Mom.
I'll definitely show you hat I can become a drama writer you need not be ashamed of. I said that I wouldn't write dramas again, but this destiny-like opportunity...
I can't miss it!
The opportunity is already in my hand.
This is my destiny!
I'll show them! I'll get my revenge!
(In Japanese)How are you?
(In Japanese) I am fine.
Aigoo.
Is someone there?
(In Japanese) Stop!
(In Japanese) Please...spare me..
(In Japanese) I won't do it again... ever!
The person who breaks his promise dies.
Just what in the world are you doing?
It is human nature to break a promise.
But the person who breaks his promise to me definitely dies.
Thank you for watching King of Dramas with us.
Please follow our channel.
Have to air it within this year..!
There's no question that the biggest productions get scheduled first.
People only know Kang Hyun Min as a big star, but he's in fact the biggest idiot there is. Mr. Kang Hyun Min, this is Writer Lee Go Eun.
Get up and put your hands up if you don't want to die.
Did you fall for Anthony's deceptions again?
Why don't you sign a contract with us?
We'll make the best offer ever made to a rookie.
Do whatever it takes. Get her!
Episode 3 The Return of the King But the person who breaks their promise to me definitely dies. Who's there?
It's me, Akiko. It's late, are you not going to sleep...? Since you weren't beside me, I couldn't sleep.
Let's go home. Please don't make any noise. Y-You speak Korean...
I'm a Korean drama fan. Of course, I know some Korean.
Could you have possibly heard earlier... ?
Oh, your translation with lies?
I didn't say a word to my husband.
Were you that surprised?
My husband doesn't kill people often, though.
Then... Chairman Watanabe...
He's the best yakuza (gangster) in Kyushu area.
Watanabe Finance with 40 years of history, he's the boss of that yakuza.
My husband is a bit hard-edged and cold-blooded, but you don't know how gentle and tender he is usually.
Then the Chairman of the Watanabe Group is... Of course, it's a "group".
You can't even guess how many "team leaders" he has.
As long as you keep the promise that you would show us the drama within this year, you won't die, so don't worry.
And you asked earlier why the drama must be on TV within this year.
This... is a secret.
In fact, my husband has the last stage of stomach cancer.
So you must definitely keep your promise!
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but...
Low-grade...
What do I do?
Should I tell him that I can't do it now?
But life is more important!
I can't be killed by a yakuza with last-stage stomach cancer!
Wouldn't it be better to tell him that I can't do this, before it becomes too late?
You've come here and now you say you can't do it?
I have only one life, so who cares even if I use his money?
The dice of destiny is already cast anyway.
The Japanese Watanabe Group are on the line holding.
Good afternoon, Mr. Tanaka.
I'm Empire Productions Representative Oh Jin Wan.
How are you doing? About that investment you told me about earlier, is it okay to send a script over now?
We have decided to sign with the World Production agency.
World Production?
Anthony, that jerk!
It's not like somebody is chasing us. Please, let's go together.
To put the drama on TV within this year, we have no time to lose, not a second.
Within this year?
Yes, broadcasting the drama within this year is the condition of his investment.
There are just a few months left this year, how can we get a broadcasting time slot?
I can do that, so you'd better focus on your script now.
The real war is just started from now on.
Representative, congratulations!
The deposit is wired to our account.
As if it's so new to us..
Why aren't you coming in?
Oh, it's Writer Lee.
You've seen him before, right? He's Joo Dong Seok, the producer.
You're having lunch.
Well, I'm done now. Come over, take a seat.
By the way, where is my desk?
Oh, it's over there.
Here, Miss Writer.
Then, where is the room that I'll be sleeping in?
It's over there. Show her inside.
Over here, Miss Writer.
Shouldn't you give me a minimum space so that I can work on my writing?
You're not fat, but is that space too small?
No, I mean, it's not small, but it's too lacking...
It's too lacking, I agree.
Congratulations, Sunbaenim.
I rushed to come here, so I couldn't bring anything.
I heard you got the investment from Watanabe Group in Japan.
That's really just amazing!
We were lucky.
And your help was great too, Representative Oh.
What do you mean "lucky"?
It was solely because of your competence.
It's been awhile.
I thought you two were having a bad connection, but I guess I was wrong.
Like me, I thought Writer Lee also wished sunbae's business to be ruined, but I was wrong about that too.
Three years ago, when the quick-service biker died.
How could all the details of that accident be on the media maliciously?
Why were all those articles pouring out without giving us any chance to block them?
Haven't you doubted that?
Perhaps ...
That tip-off was done by me.
I mean... why, you?
You don't know? For 7 years, under you, I had done all kinds of work, but although I'd cleaned up all crap you made, you took all the credit.
Did you think I would live forever as the second man of "Empire", the subordinate of Anthony?
How could you?
How could...?
How dare you?
"How dare... you?"
I should be saying that to you.
The representative of "Empire" now is...
ME.
Drop that useless hope, please.
With the investment contract which will become invalid if the show can't be aired within this year, you can't fight against me.
Therefore, please just stay broken quietly. If you still want to get that tiny bit of respect as sunbae.
What are you watching so intently?
I'm just cleaning.
Miss Writer Lee.
Let's talk for a little bit.
This is the writer's room prepared by Empire Production for you, Writer Lee Go Eun.
Earlier, I was a bit too enraged, so I said rude things.
Please understand.
Why don't you sign a contract with us, Empire Production?
I signed a contract with World Production's Anthony Kim.
How much did you receive for that contract?
Well, the contract...
I don't think Anthony gave you a proper payment for the contract because he came to me to borrow $3,000 a few days ago.
Are you being like this to me in order to get your revenge on him?
If you thought of me as such a small (petty) person, then I'm a bit disappointed.
Oh, I heard that the investment from Watanabe of Japan was done solely because of your script, Writer Lee Go Eun.
By any chance, were you deceived by Anthony, again?
Writer Lee, even if you're working with Anthony, your script won't be able to be aired.
As soon as you sign a contract with us... Well, was it "Morning of Kyeongseong"?
That script will be proceeded right away and be aired, I guarantee you.
This is the key for this apartment.
While staying here, please take your time to consider this offer.
Tomorrow afternoon, I will come to see you with the contract.
That Anthony will never be able to make this drama.
Did Writer Lee not say where she was going?
Well, when I was back from the rest room, she was already gone.
What about her phone?
No matter how many times I try, she doesn't answer her phone. But you know, Director. Since we got the advance deposit, can't we have some delicious food?
Our destiny depends on how to use that money.
What about the new recruits?
They will come to work here by 3 PM.
Are you not eating?
You can eat the rest.
I heard that the investment from Watanabe of Japan was done solely because of your script, Writer Lee Go Eun.
I will give you the best condition you can get as a rookie writer.
10 million won ($10,000) per episode, the advance payment 100 million won for contract, and the rest of the payment 100 million won, so in total 200 million won ($200,000).
As soon as you sign a contract with us, that script will be proceeded right away and be aired, I guarantee you.
Don't forget. Anthony will definitely not be able to make this drama.
Our Writer Lee Go Eun, are you writing the script well?
By the way, Mom, would it be important to keep the promise with a person I can't trust?
Or would it be more important to choose the guaranteed future, not keeping that promise?
Is something going on?
Oh no. I'm just saying.
This child...
Why are you thinking hard about such an easy thing?
What's so important about the promise with a person you can't trust? The future with the guaranteed success is more important, of course.
I guess so, right?
Auntie! Please give the food quickly!
I'm busy right now so I will call you later okay?
This person is unavailable right now.
The signal is on, but she's not picking up the phone.
Anyway, I sent a text message that we will have a meeting at 3PM today, so she will come by then.
Director?
We're ready to have the meeting.
Writer Lee?
Miss Writer Lee Go Eun?
Thank you for giving me such a good opportunity, but I wish my drama would be made to give hope to everyone, not to step on someone.
I can't take this opportunity by breaking a promise.
My first script, "Morning of Kyeongseong" will be made by World Production as promised.
We couldn't even contact you. What in the world happened?
I'm late only by 3 minutes.
Are you saying you ignored the calls on purpose?
The place where people live should be more humane, don't you think so?
As promised, I sent the contract payment to your account, so check it later.
Hurry up and go in. Everyone is waiting for you.
Call Writer Jeong.
"Elegant Revenge 2" will be aired this year.
For that, Park Shin Yang (a famous Korean actor) is going to take the main role next year...
We can do the casting again.
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
Call a meeting immediately.
This is Han Kang Wook, who newly joined World Production as a producer.
Yes, nice to meet you. Yes.
He's good at the producer work but not good at family matters, so he divorced two years ago.
And here is Team Leader Park Seok Hyun for finance.
I'm still single, no need to worry about being divorced.
He's single, no chance to get married, so don't care about him.
And here is Goo Yi Jae, the youngest staff for errands.
Please take care of me!
I'm Goo Yi Jae of Production team.
I'm Writer Lee Go Eun of "Morning of Kyeongseong".
Please take care of me!
So now we've done our introductions. Everyone here who will share the destiny with our World Production, as you can see, the level of our office is on the ground.
But... remember this...
Aired within this year?
Airing it within this year is the condition for the investment.
The rest of the investment fund of 9.9 billion won, a total of 10 billion won ($10 million) worth drama, "Morning of Kyeongseong"
definitely needs to be aired within this year.
What will happen if it can't be aired within this year?
"Top Secrets"...
Wasn't it casting the actor Choi Tae Joon?
This early morning, Tae Joon had a big accident during the first shooting, so he needs to rest for 8 week.
If he needs 8 weeks, the shooting will be canceled soon.
Yes. The media is talking about his "displaying the fighting spirit for the drama" in real time, but we should consider that his drama is actually going to be canceled.
Then, are you saying they're releasing the false information to the media?
Then the remained spot is only November for S Broadcasting...
Make a list of actors in their 30's who can play for "Morning of Kyeongseong" aired in November.
Let's go with November, S Broadcasting.
Even so, broadcasting it in November is...
November in this year at S Broadcasting.
This is the matter of life or death of our Empire Production.
The meeting is starting again.
Tell them I'll be there soon.
Why did you come back again?
Why did you come back again, not going to Oh Jin Wan?
Moreover, right after Oh Jin Wan visited.
And then saying all the nonsense about a friend and the luxurious apartment or whatnot.
Did you think I would fall for your lame acting?
I guess the luxurious apartment part must be true. Oh Jin Wan, not your friend, showed it to you, though.
Why did you come back to me?
Is the reason really that important?
It's not that important, but I'm very curious.
People like you wouldn't understand, but there are principles and promises to some people.
And there are some people who live to keep those things even if they don't have much.
I just kept them, that's all.
How grateful I am.
It's not for your sake.
Of course it's for mine.
So it wasn't anything special.
And I've told you before.
It's not "you". It's "Representative."
M Since you came from the movie industry, if I make an example in that side, if you made a movie, you need to release it through movie theaters.
But in our field, there are only three theaters.
So-called "3 companies of ground-wave".
If you can't get the time slot through these three, the drama production itself is impossible, far from releasing part.
Then, the competition to get the time slot must be really fierce.
But the golden time for a drama is 10pm!
It's 744 : 1.
So, if we think about it's probability....
Don't you have the calculator?
0.134%.
It's just 0.1%, no need to round it up.
You will see with your own eyes from now on how hard it is to get the time slot.
Let's start the casting.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Excluding the actors who belong to our Empire Production, these are the actors who can play for the drama which will be aired in November.
Lee Jeong Shik and Oh Tae Yeon, do you think they can be the top (main role)?
Exclude them.
Remove Jeong Do Jin too. He can be the top for a daily soap opera, but he doesn't have the mask for a mini-series.
About Cha Seung Hyun....
Isn't he going to film a movie in December?
Cha Seung Hyun can't work with us because of the movie.
Who do you think would be okay for the main role, Writer Lee?
While writing the script, haven't you considered any among these guys?
How about Yoo Ha Yeon?
I think he's the most similar one to the main role's image.
He's not good because he's a junkie.
I heard he quit last year.
The most unreliable words in the world is that a junkie says he quit the drug and the game-addict says he quit gambling.
Tell him to blow the lunch box bomb by himself.
How about Seo Tae Ha, Director?
But would he want to play the role for a "revenge" drama again?
He has a severe depression issue, so as far as I know, he has been getting therapy for months.
Acting must be done by acting...
Next actor.
Is depression a sin?
Well... I didn't mean that, but...
Then should we go with Seo Tae Ha?
Ah, forget it.
Who else is left?
Kim Jin Ho and Kang Hyun Min.
Kim Jin Woo has a lot of female fans.
He's very hot now, not only in Korea but also in other countries.
Not only S Broadcasting, but also all three stations can't resist him.
Let's go with Kim Jin Woo, Representative.
Now what?
If I say no, then no.
Well do you have a reason to say no?
Why are you leaving Kim Jin Woo out and going with Kang Hyun Min?
Prepare for that.
Excuse me, Director Heo..
It has been only for a short while since you were scouted to our Empire after staying in the U.S. for years.
So I guess you don't know well, so that's why I'm telling you this.
Kim Jin Woo really hates Anthony.
Back in the day, Anthony stole Kim Jin Woo's woman.
What does that have to do with us?
Currently, Kang Hyun Min is considering "Getting Married to My Man," and...
By the Writer Gong Ji Young?
Representative, Kang Hyun Min is doing a fan meeting at the Diamond Hall of Ace Hotel.
It ends at 5 o'clock.
Prepare a clean copy of the script. I'm taking off.
I'm making myself engrave him in my mind. That way he can be alive in the script.
So have you engraved him well?
The more I think about it, the more I like it.
He looks intelligent, with an air of melancholy about him.
Once you see him in person, you'll find out in less than a minute how intelligent and melancholic he is.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains.
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas.
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be
You raise me up to more than I can be
Long time no see!
Yes, hello.
You should be holding fanmeetings in Japan and China besides this crowded Seoul.
So I should.
I have a good drama in the makings, you should work with me.
You're still making dramas these days?
I got an investment of 10 billion won from Japan.
I'll get the November broadcasting slot at S Broadcasting.
I did hear that Tae Joon has been seriously injured.
I guess he couldn't get up this time.
I'll cut to the chase. This is my offer.
The best rate in the nation, 100 million won per episode.
100 million?
20 episodes, so 2 billion. Once you sign the contract, you'll be paid the total amount within 15 days.
Yes?
The total amount?
I guarantee you the quality of the drama.
Moreover, as it's being funded by a Japanese source, we can even try for a national broadcast in Japan.
It's the birth of a new Hallyu Star.
You'll be rolling in dough. To tell it like it is,
I know that you need big money for the shopping mall business that you started beyond your means.
If you just sign the document you get 2 billion.
What about the script?
Have a good look at it and meet me at the restaurant at the Cheongdam intersection.
Read it fast, but pay attention.
It's a voucher worth 2 billion.
You're really cool, Representative.
But do you think Kang Hyun Min will come there?
There is one thing people know about Kang Hyun Min and one thing they don't.
Although they know that Kang Hyun Min is a star, they don't know that he's the world's biggest idiot who only knows money.
He will come without question.
I'm going!
I, Kang Hyun Min, am getting 2 billion and going to the world!
Go to Hollywood, let's go partytime.
Kwang Soo, turn it up!
Empire's Representative Oh Jin Wan Hey turn it off!
Yes, Representative Oh.
I've heard that you were being bothered by some pathetic scripts lately.
I'm calling to disperse your worries a bit.
We're planning to do Jeong Hong Ju's project, how about it?
If it's Writer Jeong Hong Ju...
Elegant Revenge 2?
Wasn't Shin Yang hyung going to do that?
It's Empire's best drama, of course we have to go with Korea's best actor.
Aren't you just asking me because Shin Yang refused it?
To me, the best actor in Korea is always Kang Hyun Min, no question about it.
Please send the script, then.
In any case, it's Writer Jeong Hong Ju who can turn everything to gold.
That guarantees the quality of the work.
What month is the broadcast?
November. At S Broadcasting.
November at S Broadcasting?
No, it's nothing.
Ah, right.
You know the guy called Anthony, don't you?
By Anthony you mean... Ah, the person who was at Empire in the past.
It looks like he's trying to start again with a Japanese investment of 10 billion.
Didn't he come look for you?
No, he didn't.
I heard there's a problem with the Japanese contract.
At any rate, I'll send the contract to your agency.
Give me a call when you make up your mind.
I understand, have a good day.
Dang, now I'm confused.
Hey, hurry up and turn around.
Hyung, what about the charity event for senior citizens?
Listen, it's a matter of billions of money.
I can care less about those senior citizens!
Just turn around, now!
Man, I'm so confused.
Anthony...
I see that he got to talk to Kang Hyun Min before I did...
What did you think, Hyung? Darling, if I had the brains to tell whether a script is good or not, would I ask you?
I really like it.
I've never seen any drama like this before.
Is it..?
But Hyung, shouldn't you be talking to the Representative?
Don't worry, I can talk to him after making up my mind.
Telling them too soon will only cause headaches.
Then, Hyung, what are you going to do?
This one or the Empire's?
Well... honestly...
I like this, but... but I'm not sure if Anthony really got funding from a Japanese source or if he's bluffing...
Hyung, if it's not certain isn't it better to go with Empire?
Empire.
Gosh, this gives me a headache.
Kang Hyun Min's Manager just called.
His highschool teacher died, so he had to go to the funeral.
So he can't come here today.
It's Oh Jin Wan.
The Empire has targeted Kang Hyun Min and played some tricks.
Seonbaenim.
I see that you talked to Hyun Min already.
Why are you so obsessed with Kang Hyun Min?
Why do you think I'm doing this?
Do you think I really like that idiot who can't even write his own name in Chinese?
His voice is pathetic, he thinks acting is all about posing, he's such a stuck-up who's crazy about money.
Why would I be obsessed with him?
I'm just... using him to destroy you, Seonbaenim.
Is this... a challenge?
The one sitting on the throne of the Empire is me.
And as long as I'm Empire's Representative, you definitely won't be able to make a comeback.
Representative, it's a bad news!
Kang Hyun Min, confirmed casting for Elegant Revenge 2
Seeing that they've already published news articles about casting Kang Hyun Min for Elegant Revenge 2, I guess the Empire has already taken action.
Find out where Kang Min Hyung is.
I'm going to Kang Hyun Min's house.
Aren't you going to see that intelligent actor with an air of melancholy?
Me too?
Since we don't have a director yet, we should at least introduce the rookie writer to him.
Should I go?
Where on earth do you think he went?
That's what I want to ask now.
We found him, Director.
Today is an actor Kim Jin Woo's birthday and everyone is inside a VIP room drinking alcohol.
Thank you, thank you!
He can't come back. He's a jerk you should never work with.
Why do you not like that guy?
You don't have to know that far.
It's not just one or two people who hate Anthony in this field.
Oh, that's right. Thinking of that, the girl you dated with a few years ago, Anthony took her away from you, right?
Got it? Okay!
Wow, indeed, I can't win over you, Representative Kim.
Want a drink?
We should do introductions.
This is Writer Lee Go Eun, the writer of "Morning of Kyeong Seong".
Director, you really...
This there a reason for me to meet this person?
Did you not see the article?
I will give you more (money) than Empire. How much do you want?
Representative, I've decided to work for "Elegant Revenge 2".
Okay, fine.
You can trust Empire Production.
But, you'd better not trust Oh Jin Wan of Empire Production.
What on earth is the reason that you're so obsessed for Kang Hyun Min?
Why would I be?
Do you think I'm doing this because I like that guy who is too ignorant to write his own name in Chinese characters?
He has terrible vocal, and thinks his acting is the best.
That rude jerk who is crazy about only money, why would I obsess about him?
I'm just... using him to destroy you, Sunbaenim.
Hey, you guys, leave us alone.
I'm going crazy... Representative Oh, that son of b**ch!
Geez, how embarrassing!
Did you have to turn it on in front of those guys?
Are you going to do it or not?
But will just ask you something.
Why are you two like that to each other?
I will tell you truthfully.
This is the war between me and Oh Jin Wan of Empire Production.
And you're now on board of my ship.
Production team for this drama decided that no more shooting is possible.
so the drama "Top Secrets" is canceled. As for its replacement drama, we're looking into all possible options with open-mind, but so far, there is nothing decided yet.
Director! There is a rumor that "Elegant Revenge 2" will replace that, but is it true?
Please tell us more!
Is it true that Writer Jeong Hong Joo's drama will be aired?
Then, what is the best among those options?
Director, it's of course "Elegant Revenge 2" of Empire Production.
CP Na, how could say that?
If Writer Jeong Hong Joo heard that, she would've been upset.
What Na Moon Young said isn't totally wrong.
Even if it's Jeong Hong Joo from Empire, we don't have to beg her first.
Then, what's the best among the dramas with scripts? Well, considering only the drama itself, "Morning of Kyeong Seong" is the best.
Kang Hyun Min is going to work with me for my drama.
Yes, Reporter Park.
I've met him in this morning and finished all the discussion.
He's on bad terms with his Representative, so he even asked me (for this role).
What do you mean, Empire?
Hyun Min said he hasn't even met anyone from Empire. [Kang Hyun Min, didn't even meet production team for "Elegant Revenge 2"]
Will he play in a drama which doesn't even have a script? [Will Kang Hyun Min play for Elegant Revenge 2? - no script is made yet.]
That's right, he said it was just one of all dramas he was looking into.
[Kang Hyun Min 'Elegant Revenge 2' Cast "NO!"]
Right now Kang Hyun Min-
So you're trying to do some media play?
In real time, the refutation news is being uploaded.
What shall we do?
Contact the representative of his agency.
Aigoo, seriously!
How could you decide such important matter without me?
If you discuss with me, will I take more commission from you?
Hyun Min, it's Empire, Empire!
Do you want to fight against Representative Oh and finish your actor's life?
Aigo, seriously, you brat.
Hyun Min! Damn! I've lost my face in front of my friends, but if I work with Reprentative Oh, those guys will think of me a moron!
I will make Representative Oh apologize to you!
Do you want him to apologize in front of all those guys?
Oh, I don't know!
I don't know, I don't know!
Director Oh Aigo, I could barely persuade Hyun Min.
Please don't worry.
All those articles which Anthony released are now removed.
I've just received that report.
[Kang Hyun Min, reconfirmed to act for "Elegant Revenge 2"]
So, who finally got hold of Kang Hyun Min, Reprentative Oh or Anthony?
Well, I can't figure it out, either.
There are even some articles which disappear if you click them.
But if you go to some other sites, again you can find... Tell both of them to come to my office immediately.
Sunbaenim, I think I clearly warned you.
Then, I will warn you too.
I got Kang Hyun Min.
Haven't you seen all those articles getting removed weakly?
I'll get to the point. Whether bringing the contract with Kang Hyun Min to me, or bringing Hyun Min in front of me, bring me something firm.
Director, are you now doubting about me because of Anthony's media play?
I'm the Representative of Empire.
Representative Oh. Even if you're the Representative of Empire Production, the drama director here is me!
By 11 AM tomorrow, before our meeting for broadcasting schedule, Bring Kang Hyun Min in front of me.
The person who brings Kang Hyun Min tomorrow will be the owner of November time slot.
The number you called is busy now.
PD Joo, what about Kang Hyun Min?
Representative Choi, what about Kang Hyun Min?
Kang Hyun min is under water? (implying "hiding without any contact detail")
Even without Road manager Kwang Soo, he's been out of reach for 8 hours.
Out of reach?
Have you searched all possible places?
Are you sure he went under water?
If Kang Hyun Min went under water, he wouldn't go where he usually goes.
From now on, anyone who is close to Hyun Min, whether it's an actor, or a manager, find those people who are staying home today and visit all those houses.
Their homes?
Don't you know that Kang Hyun Min is a video game addict?
You're his road manager, but what did you do, not sticking to Hyun Min?
Well, I went to the rest room, but when I came back, he was gone...
Where do you think he will possibly go?
He's not at Jang Geun Seok's house.
What about your side?
I've already tried that method.
Cell phone....?
Long time no see, Detective Lee.
So you want us to track down the location of Kang Hyun Min using his cell phone?
Yes, that bastard's cell phone is on.
You know, that's illegal.
I know it's illegal. That's why I'm asking you.
Hello Professor, this is Lee Go Eun.
Yes, mornings are fine with me.
Then I'll see you at the school.
That Kang Hyun Min bastard, maybe he's passed out somewhere drunk on purpose to annoy us.
On purpose?
Would he have taken his game console if he did it on purpose?
How do you know that he took his game console with him?
Well, actually, the thing is...
Just spit it out!
He said he'd fire me if I talked!
I'm your employer!
Now, talk!
He's in Yangpyeong.
Yangpyeong?
I got it, Detective Lee.
Producer Joo, find out who's the closest to Yangpyeong and give me a call.
Kang Hyun Min is in Yangpyeong right now.
Kang Hyun Min is still alive and well.
Hyun Min, let's go to Hollywood.
Go to Hollywood.
Yes, looks like Writer Lee Go Eun is the closest.
Lee Go Eun?
Yes, she texted me this morning that she's going to the Yicheon Moonhwa University at 9.
I'm so glad that your work is going to be made into a drama.
It's not confirmed yet, but it will be decided soon.
Well then... I don't mind; you may take the call.
I can't take your call at this moment.
Hey, don't hang up!
I'm in the middle of an interview.
Our whole fate is in your hands.
Kang Hyun Min is in Yangpyeong, and we need him by 11 to do our drama.
You're the closest, so move right now!
Where in Yangpyeong is he at?
House number 350, Yangsoo-ri, Yangsoo-myeon, Yangpyeong-goon.
He's either in a pension or a cabin.
Get him at whatever cost!
I'm on my way, too, so just get him!
Do you have a death wish?
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
You've got navigation!
Take me to Yangpyeong, please!
What the heck?
Just get off!
You can charge whatever rate.
It's a dire emergency!
Representative, we're almost there.
Please, hurry up.
Hey, aren't you gonna pay me?
Just wait a sec!
Hey, lady!
Representative, I'm here.
There is a car in the garage, so he must be inside...
Writer Lee?
Answer me, Lee Go Eun! Writer Lee? What happened?
Mr. Kang Hyun Min, this is Writer Lee Go Eun.
Mr. Kang Hyun Min, I'm from the World Production.
You saw me the other day.
I'm Writer Lee Go Eun.
How did she know that I'm here?
Man, I've seen it already.
I saw what you were doing with that actress. I can spread the news!
I mean it!
Just open the door!
Who in their right mind would open the door when hiding?
Yee-ha!
Stop, stop!
Hold still!
You want to die?
I've got to get dressed!
If you don't want to die, get up and lift up your hands. You, do you even know what kind of a gun that is?
Are you crazy?
Sure. I'm completely crazy.
So you should get out of here if you want to live.
I'd rather die than go out like this. Lady, I have a wife and children.
I don't need it.
Just spare me!
You just pay attention to the road!
Yes, Representative.
I'm on my way with Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
Writer Lee!
Let go! Let go of it!
I can't die like this!
Just turn the volume down already!
Writer Lee! Lee Go Eun, what happened? !
I said, let go!
I can't let you go!
Threatening with an umbrella isn't enough?
If you don't come with me, we can't produce our drama!
What's that got to do with me?
Do you really think you can make me come with you?
Just listen to me for once, then I'll let you go.
What?
I know that only you can make up your mind. That you call the shots.
But just keep this in mind.
I will try my best to show how seroius, how marvelous of an actor you are.
That's why you're just a rookie. All the writers write for me, the protagonist, the very Kang Hyun Min.
Yes, it's me.
How did it go with Kang Hyun Min?
We're bringing him with us.
Just wait for a little while.
Great! Representative, even if neither of them get Kang Hyun Min, Empire Productions has far better conditions.
Plus, Representative Oh is bringing Kang Hyun Min right now.
Well then, it's pretty much decided.
Then, the Monday-Tuesday slot for dramas in November shall go to the Empire Production's Elegant Revenge 2...
Pardon me.
How dare you barge in? !
My name is Kang Hyun Min.
I'll turn the tables when they least expect it.
Does living like that make you happy at all?
In this world, those with power oppress the losers.
The broadcast schedule report is not available?
Bring me the bank statement with proof of funds for the production.
If you can only produce it by covering everything up with money, I don't want that.
Why don't you step down?
I mean, I'm firing you.
Episode 4 TheArtof War Alright, I understand. Representative,
Anthony did end up with the broadcasting slot. Kang Hyun Min is with Anthony right now. Representative Oh, I'm truly sorry.
This is so not like Hyun Min... Why would he do this? Why would he...?
Representative Choi, do you think that that is a valid excuse?
Don't ever expect to see me again.
Representative, Representative!
I didn't mean...
Wow, seriously...
I can't win with you, Representative.
You even sent people all the way there to track me down.
At any rate, why did you change your mind all of a sudden?
That's why you're just a rookie. All the other writers are already doing it. Writing for the protagonist, the star, me.
By the way, did you mean it?
That you will write for me.
That you will try to prove what an awesome actor I am.
Do you really mean that?
Then listen.
If you don't keep that promise, you'll be in big trouble.
I think you are mistaken.
My decision has always been the same.
I just went away to study the script.
There was no need for such a fuss.
So we were panicking for nothing.
How can a man ever change his word?
By the way, Representative.
About that writer, what kind of a person is she?
Does she stay true to her words? Representative, as we had originally planned, let's slate Elegant Revenge 2 for next year...
It's not over yet. Director Heo, go ahead with our preparations.
Yes. Anthony, just wait for a little bit.
I will turn the tables on you when you least expect it.
Have you lost your mind completely?
Hey, Kang Hyun Min! No matter how good-looking you are, it doesn't take much to lose your shine in this field.
If you're going to call all the shots at your whim, do you even need me?
Are you suggesting that you don't need me any more?
To be honest, I don't need you any more. Whether I'm good-looking or not, it's thanks to me that you're making money.
Tell me, is it not?
Hyun Min, what I mean is... If that's not what you mean, just shut your mouth.
Also, since I procured this contract, I'm not giving you a single penny for it.
Gwang Soo, let's go.
Argh, that rascal...!
Hyung, each time I see this team, they just brighten my day.
Aigoo, she plays coy...
No matter how you slice it, when it comes to looks, our Bit Na is the best.
Yes, her looks are the best.
Bit Na, is something wrong?
I don't know, I'm just pissed.
Why, why?
Even at our last concert, they wouldn't let me say anything to the audience!
Who the heck did that? Chief Go, saying that if fans hear my voice, they will be completely put off.
That stupid Chief Go needs to learn a lesson.
What's wrong with our Bit Na's voice?
It's unique and sexy!
Bit Na, you wanted a new car, right?
I'll buy you one.
A nice one.
I've got a big payment coming in.
Then I'll buy you one.
Oppa... I la la, I love you!
I suppose all your experience counts for something, seeing that you managed to bring in Kang Hyun Min when the Empire failed to do that.
You know, once I target an actor, I never let go.
I was wondering if you had lost your touch since you weren't doing so well for 3 years.
So, what about the script?
Working on episode 5 now.
She's done pretty well so far for someone without any publications or awards.
Yes, indeed.
However, that ends here.
Let her finish what she's working on.
Then switch to a more seasoned writer.
Needless to say, the production will go live soon enough.
You can't do that with a newbie like that.
I heard that all she's got is some experience as an assistant to Writer Jeong. Is that right?
Yes, that is correct, but...
Just get a different writer.
I'm telling you this as the director of the broadcasting station.
Representative, you're back.
You're back.
Oh, Representative, you're back.
Why are you in such a good mood?
My mom is here.
Representative, how have you been? How have you been? Since my Go Eun wasn't coming home for nights working on the script,
I've come to make sure that you're feeding her well. Oh, Mother (of Go Eun), you should come often.
The food is so good.
Hadn't had a home-cooked meal in a long time.
Exactly, Mother.
You should have some, too, Representative.
I have eaten already.
Oh, how fortunate that I packed some extra.
Keep it in the fridge so that Representative can have it later.
Is my daughter doing alright?
I trust you to take good care of her.
I shall excuse myself now.
Have a safe trip back.
Mom, you're leaving already?
Yes, it's already late for me to get ready for the evening rush.
I'll see my mom to the bus station.
I need to talk with you, why don't you say goodbye now?
That's right.
You just stay here and talk with him. I'll get a taxi.
- Bye, and please come again.
- Thanks for the food!
I will cut to the chase.
In addition to the contract fee, I'll give you a bonus, so 30 million won (~$30k in USD) in total.
What does that mean...?
I would like you to step down now.
I'm firing you.
So leave.
If you want to know, I'll tell you.
I used you to get the investment, and now that I don't need you, I'm deserting you.
You asked me if I wanted to spend the rest of my life grilling mackerels.
Seemed like your mackerel business is going well, that's not a bad way of spending the rest of your life.
- You said, dreams exist to be fulfilled, not reminisced.
- I lied to convince you... You can't tell me to leave.
It's my writing!
I'm sorry, but we've already found a new writer.
What a scum.
Yes, maybe not the world's lowest, but the lowest scum in Korea for sure.
So leave. I can't!
I won't!
I'll go to the drama department and tell them all about what a scum you are.
You would better not do that.
You'll only face the reality of how pathetic you are.
It was the drama department that asked for a new writer.
Hey, you there!
We'll have to see when the first draft....
What, what is this?
I am Writer Lee Go Eun of "The Morning of Kyeongseong."
I know that I'm being rude, but I just had to ask a question.
I just heard from the production company that they're getting a new writer.
They said that a new writer was requested by the drama department. Is that true?
Yes, it is.
I know I'm a rookie, with no publication or broadcasting experience.
However, didn't you give us the slot based on my writing?
Please, give me a chance.
Do you have any idea where you are?
Director...
That you have no publications or broadcasting experience. As the final person in charge, I'm telling you as the director of the drama department.
We can't let a rookie with no publication or broadcasting experience go out to war.
It is better off not to start a war when defeat is evident.
Then, I'm... In a nutshell, as long as you're not in the team, this war can be won.
If I've made myself clear, go now.
If... If I leave, can you guarantee that this war will be won?
You probably can't.
Nobody knows for sure.
You can only excel if given an opportunity.
Even if I have to leave the production, I just wanted to say this to you.
What the... What a brat... how insolent...
She may be feisty, but she's right.
Huh, what?
No, just rambling. Representative, are you asleep?
Writer Lee Go Eun... will she be alright?
She seemed to be in a lot of shock.
Forget about it and just sleep.
I'm trying, but I can't sleep.
What did I tell you?
To make a drama...
One must leave even if it is his own father.
Yes, so keep that in mind and sleep.
Tomorrow, we'll get the contract with Kang Hyun Min ready.
Aunty, can you hurry up a bit?
Alright!
Gwang Soo, stop.
I told you to work out, not to show yourself off working out.
They're all dying to see me though.
All these girls have come here to see this face and this body.
I guess it doesn't hurt to sign the contract among flowers.
The terms are as we had discussed before. As soon as you sign the contract, you'll get 2 billion won in 15 days, all in one lump sum.
Gwang Soo, my stamp.
Let's break a leg!
Just deposit the money within the set time.
You can't issue a certificate of broadcasting slot?
Why can't you issue us a certificate when you've already given us the slot?
Who says I'm not issuing you one?
Bring me the bank statement that has the funds for this production.
Not something you just type up on Word, but an actual bank book that shows the money.
You know it, too.
How many drama productions bite off more than they can chew, and end up in a wreck with insufficient funds.
That hurts the reputation of the broadcasting station as well!
Once you give me the certificate, I get the investment from Japan.
Not just a couple billion, but 10 billion!
Well then, show me the bank book with that 10 billion.
Director ...
A certificate of a broadcasting slot comes with my official seal to represent the broadcasting station.
If you want my seal, show me the money first.
We have to deposit the 2 billion for Kang Hyun Min, too. What now?
If he doesn't get that 2 billion, he'll go with someone else for sure.
Then, the whole drama is..
What if we explained our situation to the Japanese sponsor?
I've already contacted the person in charge, it's the same story.
An official document of the broadcasting schedule.
What the S Broadcasting Director wants is not bank books.
Here, take a shot.
- Cheers - Thanks for your hard work.
I heard that they're switching the writer for "Morning of Kyeongseong."
That Lee Go Eun, who wrote the synopsis, came to the Director and made a scene, I heard.
But it's a new genre we've not done before.
How much better could an experienced writer be?
In the end, it is up to the production skills of Representative Kim of the World Production.
And we all know that recently, many production companies start shooting, then run out of money, and end up not paying the actors and the filming crew.
We've seen so many cases like that.
If you're giving the slot to Representative Kim, it would be good to make sure about the funding situation.
I know, I already told Anthony about securing the funds.
Hey, Representative Kim!
I came here to get dinner, and I heard that you were here, so I've come to say hi.
Oh, I see. Come in, come in.
I was thinking about what you said earlier today, Director.
And I admit that I was in the wrong.
As you had requested, I will bring you a bank book showing the funds and also draw up a budget plan.
Of course, that you should.
Here, have a drink.
What are you doing outside?
I have a favor to ask, Director.
I heard that you play golf in Nonhyun-dong lately... Give me the combination of your locker, and I'll prepare something for you by tomorrow.
Representative Kim...
It's just a token of my appreciation.
Please take it.
Appreciation for what?
The certificate of broadcasting slot.
Hey, Anthony, are you still doing this crap?
What about you, Director?
What? Last year, on March 24 and September 13, KJ Production sent you some token appreciations.
Watch your words.
I thought they were just rumors.
That's right. Totally senseless rumors.
Got it?
Yes, I'm sure.
Oh, would you check if my car is parked ok outside?
It's black, and the number is 8911.
Yes, I shall, Director.
Are you still doing things this way?
What... do you mean?
I guess people never change.
Since I had a drink, I'll just say one thing as a man.
Representative Kim, I... hate you. (dropping the honorifics)
I especially hate those dirty, shameless ways of darkness of how you do your business.
Yes, those dirty, shameless ways of darkness are exactly how I've been doing my business, and I'll continue to do so.
Now, think about it.
How much longer do you think you'll be in the drama department, Chief Producer Nam?
The way I see it, with all the promotions, 5 years at best?
Do you even have a plan for your retirement?
That's why you're such a low jerk, bastard.
I'm paying for my own drinks.
Have you looked into the things I asked you about?
Oh, that?
I've found a few after some internal investigation.
Just as I told you, right?
What would you like me to do?
So that he'll never come near this field...
Ajumma, another bottle of soju.
- Here, another bottle.
- Aunty, we'd like another grilled mackerel.
- Yes. Yes, coming!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Because they liked my script so much, I'm on vacation.
Well then, hurry up and grill some mackerels.
Can't you see how busy we are?
Yes, Madame Kang .(Madame Tenacity)
It will be withdrawn from the bank in 30 minutes.
Ohhyung Golf Course in Nonhyun-dong.
Director Moon's locker number and combination.
8911?
8911... No, put it in your mouth and swallow it.
What? We can't leave any trace behind unless they cut our guts open.
Get the money and deliver it right away.
I'll go get the certificate of broadcasting slot.
Yes, I got it.
Where did they all go with the door open?
Writer Lee ...
I just came to get my stuff...
What is that? Yes? Oh, it's nothing.
Well, you know, Miss Writer, it is inevitable for the production to start, so... it just happens this way.
I guess "The Morning of Kyeongseong" will be the inaugural work of World Production.
Break a leg.
And the writer?
Still in search for a decent experienced one.
Alright, you may leave.
Well, have a good day. One of my assistants just stopped by the Ohhyung Golf Course in Nonhyun-dong, and says that it looks really nice, perhaps they've renovated the interior.
You should go check it out.
So, has the funding issue been resolved?
Yes, he got the money from a Japanese sponsor.
There's nothing to worry.
Wow, Representative Kim has done it in the end!
How impressive.
In that dirty way.
It's all thanks to your concerns.
Do you know how many hard-working professionals in this field fall in despair because of people like you?
Yes, I'm well aware of them.
I'm one of those professionals in this field as well.
Yes, Director.
Hey, you bastard.
Is this a joke?
How dare you make a fool of me?
That's not possible.
Why would the money be missing?
Hello, hello!
Direc...... Producer Joo, what happened?
Did you make the delivery?
Well,thatis ...
Hurry up and tell me!
Writer Lee Go Eun has hid the money bag, so I couldn't even leave the office.
Representative.
Where did you put it? You were acting as though everything will go smoothly if I wasn't on the team, but in reality, you had to use such dirty means!
It doesn't matter.
Why doesn't it matter?
I didn't leave just so you could do this!
You left on your own. Just give it up.
Where is that money? The money is for producing the drama, not for lobbying with bribes like that.
You don't know anything, stay out of it.
Then explain it then.
There's no time for that.
Just tell me, where is that money?
I won't say a word until you convince me completely.
Without that money, this drama won't happen.
Are you happy now? Your writing will not be broadcast. If you have to cover everything up with money to produce it,
I'm the original writer,
FORGET ABOUT IT THEN.
Producer Joo.
Miss Writer, Representative isn't doing this because he wants to.
Don't just stand there like that, and say something!
Why should I move?
I said move!
Aren't you getting out of the way? You keep ignoring me, you'd better get a lawyer. Even if you get the production going with bribes,
I will make sure that it doesn't get aired!
Sue all you want.
You'll be watching my drama as you wait for the proceeding.
Man, I keep missing the ball! It's not just the balls I'm missing. My arms and legs feel like they're not mine.
Yes, it's me, Director.
There was a slight accident on our part, but I'm just calling you now to tell you that I delivered it myself.
Yes, sorry.
You've still got something to say?
You know what?
What an eeevil (slurred speech as she's drunk) nasty, dirty, jerk you are?
Do you know what a cold-blooded, cruel, infernal scum you are?
You called me to ask me that?
Sure, I'll give you my answer.
I am aware of it. More than anybody in the world. Living like that, are you happy?
Living stupidly like you, how is that?
What about you living so stupidly, being trampled and torn apart?
I am not unhappy.
Because, despite the world being dirty like you, I am living.
Your kind doesn't understand the world.
The world has been very dirty from the beginning. By fair means or foul, emerging victorious through force, and dominating the losers is the world.
I am going to triumph in this filthy world.
You are going to fall.
There's something else you don't know.
In my mind now, to be living here is hell.
Hyung, you're not coming back tonight?
Hyung, it's a guest.
Guest?
Apologies for coming so late at night.
I don't know if you've heard but I won't be able to keep my promise.
I'm really thankful that you liked my work, but for unavoidable circumstances, I had to quit.
So are they changing the writer?
You got fired then.
I got fired. I got fired because I don't have any experience.
At any rate, although I won't be working on it any more, the script still means a lot to me.
Please, treat that script like a child that has lost its mother until the very end and fulfill your role with affection.
Did you come to me to get you unfired?
No, I didn't come for that at all.
No, I'm not like that.
It's no use.
Come to think of it, I was a bit nervous about the writer being a rookie.
This is for the best.
Don't get your heart broken over this. It's the nature of this field.
What the heck?
I put my everything at stake for my "The Morning of Kyeongseong."
Though I'm leaving, I want you all to take it seriously with affection.
Is that so hard, you idiots?
! Is she crazy?
Drag her out of here.
Yes. Leave.
You morons!
- You're so drunk.
- What's yours?
- Just go!
You can't just get drunk and barge in like that. Living like that, does it make you happy?
Screenwriter: Lee Go Eun
Hey, Unni!
Hey, watch your driving!
That was close.
Wow, you're pretty.
- Noonim, how old are you?
- Unni, you see, we're hungry...
- Aiiiiiish.... Hey, get out all you've got. Hey, get out all you've got.
Stop staring like that and give us your money!
Ah well, can't be helped.
Good evening, police officer. Good evening, police officer.
I'm on the backstreet by Hyundai Villa in Cheongdam-dong.
Three drunk highschoolers are trying to do something to another drunk woman.
Oh, I'm just a civilian citizen.
One that pays a lot of taxes.
Please dispatch someone here quick. Thanks!
I'm... really in a bad mood tonight...
So.. could you guys just... leave me alone?
Wow, did I just hear that right?
Hey, do you want to die?
You'd better let go of me.
What is she?
You highschool brats!
Aren't you supposed to be studying?
Dang, I should have avoided her eyes.
At any rate, is she really a writer?
She's like a gangster!
How scary.
Well, do you know Lee Go Eun?
So if I do?
This is Gangnam Police Department. I understand that she was drunk, but what kind of a lady beats up three kids like that by herself?
She passed out once she got here, and we didn't know who to contact.
We checked her recent call history, and saw that she had made several calls to you.
At any rate, what is your relationship to her?
She put you down as "Youndeungpo Crazy Dog" on her contacts list.
So I got curious.
Three million won (~$3k USD) for a settlement isn't too bad.
Is it ok if she spends the night here?
Huh?
Umm..
Hey Hey! Today, on the Olympic Expressway in Seoul, a drunk truck driver crashed his truck and killed one person.
At the time of the accident, the blood alcohol content of truck driver Kim had exceeded the level of 0.1%, which means his license will be suspended.
The police are still investigating the exact circumstances of the accident, and plan to charge truck driver Kim with DUI.
On another note, early this morning, the director of the drama department of a certain broadcasting station, Moon, was arrested without a warrant.
It has been announced that Moon is suspected of charges of accepting bribes related to privileges associated with drama broadcasting slots.
The police announced that they will investigate the matters further and will seek strict corrective measures.
Additional investigations are still going on.
This news was brought to you by MBS, Kim So Yeon.
Does seeing someone get arrested give you back some senses?
You should thank the person who paid your settlement money. You may go.
Settlement money?
Who? That "Youngdeungpo Crazy Dog" took care of everything.
...drama department of a certain broadcasting station, Moon, was arrested without a warrant.
...announced that he is suspected of accepting bribes privileges associated with broadcasting slots....
Thanks for the good news, Sunbaenim.
It's rather surprising that the culprit behind all this is not on the list.
We just got the search warrant, so we're going through all his office, house, and car.
One of those places should have it.
There's one more place to check.
One more place?
A personal locker at Ohhyung Golf Course in Nonhyun-dong.
Personal locker?
It is a preferred venue for one of the bribe donors.
Keep up with your good work.
Then, that broadcasting slot goes back to null.
Schedule a meeting for tomorrow morning.
I like the news today.
The search warrant is out.
As soon as we get there, crack the door open and get the evidence right away.
Ah, aish.
Get the tools!
There's a guy that's just leaving the building.
Get him! Yes, I understand.
This morning, the director of the drama department of a broadcasting station, Moon, was arrested.
Moon is suspected of charges of receiving bribes for privileges regarding broadcasting slots.
Isn't he from the broadcasting station for your drama?
Is your drama going to be ok when someone big like him gets arrested?
I think it'll be... ok.
Seriously.
He should have just eaten grilled mackerels instead of stuffing his guts with other people's money.
It's me, Producer Joo. I just saw the news, is that money ok?
Oh, it was close.
Fortunately, Representative saw the news and took immediate action, so it's all safe.
It was really close. We were so lucky.
Then, there's no problem with the drama?
Well, I'm not sure, for the moment...
Miss Writer, I'm sorry, but I have to go to a meeting now.
If anything changes or gets decided, I'll contact you.
Now that the director has been arrested, Empire will try to shake up the broadcasting schedule.
How are things at Empire?
They submitted the synopsis of "Elegant Revenge 2" of Writer Jeong yesterday through Assistant Director Kim.
I heard that the synopsis is 10 pages long.
You can get a slot even without a synopsis, and this is "Elegant Revenge 2."
What is Writer Jeong Hong Joo doing?
Working on the script for the first two episodes.
Notify me as soon as the first drafts are done.
Have you eaten yet?
He started out as an open recruit, and has the reputation of being a nice person with good skills among the producers, so many directors support him.
However, based on school ties, some predict that Assistant Director Kim, who went to the same school as the president of S Broadcasting, will be the one.
Also, Assistant Director Kim's wife is known for her influence.
She even moved their family residence so that their children would go to the same school as the president's.
That says a lot.
Assistant Director Kim....
It was Empire's Oh Jin Wan that caused the fall of Director Moon.
Yesterday, the synopsis of Writer Jeong was given to A.D. Kim, and Director Moon was arrested this morning.
To plan an arrest without a warrant the very day of today... means that they predicted that we'd bribe Director Moon.
You mean, the person who reported Director Moon to the authorities is...
He wanted to get me arrested.
The decision of choosing a new director is up to the president.
The most likely candidate is A.D. Kim.
Notify me as soon as S Broadcasting makes the announcement of the personnel changes tomorrow.
You all go home.
The personnel changes have been announced.
[Announcements from the Human Resources Department]
The director is coming!
Let me count on your assistance.
I expect much guidance from you all.
We would like to turn this unfortunate event around and use it as a trigger to introduce a revolutionary change in the drama department of S Broadcasting.
And I believe that the priority is to ensure that we produce high quality dramas, work with actors loved by the public, and keep the production environment clean and transparent.
Consequently, the broadcasting schedule for November determined by the previous director is going to be totally revamped.
I don't accept congratulatory messages.
However, Director, please give me this one chance.
I beg of you.
Just one chance?
However, that one chance might allow someone like you to control this whole field of dramas.
I've decided against it.
I won't change my mind.
- What's going to happen to our slot?
Hurry! That position should have been yours, Assistant Director.
Show him who's really in power in this department.
You're not my superior!
I will get my work published and proudly present my name, Lee Go Eun on the script.
We'll reinstate Writer Lee Go Eun.
No one would write "The Morning of Kyeongseong" better than her.
It's not over yet!
Why don't you just cancel your contract?
- I'll help you with that.
- This is all for our drama.
You mean, your drama. The weapon with which Anthony, King of Dramas, will take back his realm.
Just don't take too long to return.
Episode 6 The Division in front of Enemies This is your writing contract. Well, then... sign here.
Leave now. Move! - Get out of my way!
- What are you guys doing? Let go. I said to MOVE!
No, Lee Go Eun!
-What is this? !
DRAG HIM OUT OF HERE!
YOU CAN'T SIGN!
Fine, I'll give you what you want.
I will leave its genre the same as the current one, noir.
And without the present day's scene, I will keep the first episode same as your draft!
Writer, it's a lie.
Just go ahead and sign.
WHAT'S THIS?
DRAG HIM OUT OF HERE!
Wait just a minute!
I'll take out the supervisor too.
Writer Lee, it isn't once or twice that he's fooled you!
Because he's desperate, he's lying to get what he wants.
No, that's not the case. You know how Anthony works, it's all the same as three years ago!
NO, LEE GO EUN! You'd better be prepared for the law suit, because I'll never lose it to you.
Don't trouble yourself about it.
You made a good decision.
We should go eat.
There is a really great Japanese restaurant nearby.
Next time. Today I have another engagement.
Ah, yes. If you were thinking of signing from the start, what was your reason for calling me?
Do you know what you just did?
You just tore my drama, no, my life to pieces.
Didn't know I was such an important person.
! Why not?
You get to do whatever you want to do but I can't do what I want to do?
That's why I said we'd do without the melodrama as a noir, without a supervisor, whatever you wanted!
Exactly, so fulfill all those promises as you said.
Director, you are amazing.
In the end, you really defeated Anthony.
What did I say.
The one who laughs in the end is the winner.
Director, what's the matter?
I didn't sign.
LEE GO EUN!
Next time... So the reason you came here, was to get what you want under the pretext of signing?
Yes, so make sure you definitely keep your promises.
Since I have it recorded here.
Geez, where did you learn to do that?
Who do you think? From you, Representative.
Why are you so surprised?
Like an amateur...
I heard this is what they usually do in the field.
Do you have confidence you can do it?
I'm asking if you can take responsibility for your decision.
What are you trying to say? If in November we were to completely fail, the sun will shine as if nothing's happened.
But you and I will be finished. I know, that it's not just you and I, but all the people involved in this work.
We will either succeed or fail solely on my decision.
That's why I can't give up.
We will win.
Are you sure you can win?
I mean, if you're sure what's the chance (%) of winning?
You've always told me, "Believe in me."
This time, Representative, it's your turn to believe in me.
This is the key for that writing space you wanted.
My own writing place?
So this is something you prepared?
You thought I'd make you write in that tiny place forever?
We MUST win this war.
That rascal.
Over this way.
Did anyone see a cutter knifer here?
On that brick pillar, you shouldn't paint with white!
Not that one, but over there, please paint there.
Everyone, enjoy your meal.
That the Representative picked this place?
You already knew?
- So only I didn't know?
! I found the place.
Deposit is 5 million won ($5,000) and monthly rent fee is 300,000 won ($300). Deposit is 5 million won ($5,000) and monthly rent fee is 300,000 won ($300).
Where should we put this?
Just put it anywhere over here.
Finally, Writer Lee gets her own writing space!
It was with everyone's help.
But hyung, what kind of Director will come?
That... is not going to be easy.
I think Director Kim Hyun Min would be good for "Morning in Kyeongseong".
We've done other works together, too.
You see, Director Kim is, uh.... difficult to get, it seems he's already working on another piece.
Then what about Director Jeong?
Ah Director Jeong!
..will also be difficult.
Difficult?
Uh, that's because...
Do you possibly have another director in mind?
No, it's not like that!
Just wait a little longer, we're doing our best to convince...
Convince?
There was a meeting of the regular PDs that caused a problem with assigning a director for the drama.
I will never work with that jerk, Anthony.
When he was kicked out of this field, everybody applauded in celebration!
I still get upset whenever I think about the way he humiliated me! And now, you expect me to work with him?
Yes, I understand your point. But what's important is that this "Morning of Kyeongseong" is not just Anthony Kim's drama, but a drama of our S Broadcasting. Do you understand?
You're the one who'd been insisting, Director, that the broadcasting stations should not work with scum like him!
It's not like he's the representative of Empire, he's just a representative of a rookie third-rate...
Third rate? !
Director Kim, your "Paradise Lost" had hit the rating of 35.9%.
Also, Director Jeong and Director Yoon, you all had big hits after working with me and became representative directors of S Broadcasting.
How can you, after achieving your current fame thanks to me, call me a third-rate producer?
! You call that fame?
It was humiliation!
You were ruling the shooting sites as if you were the director.
I won't take that again.
I took action only because you weren't a good leader!
Are you talking down to me?
What do you think you are doing?
This is a statement of the position of the regular PDs. We'd like to make it clear to you that every one of us, PDs of S Broadcasting,
Statement of refusal to work refuses to direct Anthony's production, "Morning of Kyeongseong."
Let's get out of here. You normally persist with your own decisions, why are you backing down this time?
Are you trying to get back at me?
Get back at you?
Get back at me for having my way with the slot.
Do you judge all the people of the world by your own standards alone?
Just answer my question. I'm the director of the drama department. Regardless of whether I like the slot decision or not, once it has been decided,
I have also put my life on the line for this drama.
Oh, yeah... and also...
Does it ever occur to you that your twisted ways of doing business cost you the trust of our PD's?
I trust viewership ratings more than people.
Also, I'm one of.. no, more than anyone, have put my life on the line for "Morning of Kyeongseong."
If we can't find one internally, then...
I'll bring a seasoned veteran director from outside.
A seasoned veteran?
I think the situation will be the same outside, too.
This morning I saw this coming and I thought of someone.
Director Goo?
If the internal directors refuse to work with us, why not work with freelancers like Director Goo?
He hasn't done anything in a while, but he is a tried and true veteran.
He was the best at one point, with four dramas that had over 30% in viewership rating...
But... he's a goner now.
Goner?
Five years ago, when he left the field, he retired completely and lives out in the countryside.
Retired?
I don't know the specifics, but... there are rumors that suggest that he's become an alcoholic.
I've also heard that he's become a dog seller in some remote place.
A dog seller?
Director Goo Young Mok is a serious alcoholic who can't even function as a person.
No way he can direct again.
No, that's something you have to create.
Also, wasn't it you who had produced the last drama of Director Goo?
You should know very well what a great director he is, then.
Given our current situation, the best person for the job of directing "Morning of Kyeongseong" is Director Goo Young Mok.
No one else will do. We've asked other external directors whose schedules are compatible, but they all said no.
It takes a dog to recognize a dog.
Long time, no see 'Cheongdamdong's Crazy Dog.'
I don't live in Cheongdamdong any more.
A dog is a dog no matter where he lives.
Come inside.
What brings you all the way here?
Can't just be to have a drink with me.
I want you to come with me to Seoul.
Seoul?
That's a real dog mess there.
What are you scheming?
I want you to direct a drama.
Drama?
Is there no one willing to direct for you?
After not seeing you for awhile, you're still making me laugh.
Stop wasting your effort and go back.
I was done directing dramas 5 years ago.
That's when my life ended, too.
First day of broadcasting is November 5th, 20 episodes, period piece.
My contact information is included, so give me a call after you read it.
Crazy bast***.
You're ruining my drink, get lost!
You've been drinking for 5 years, haven't you had enough?
You're the one that had said, the place for me to breathe and to stop breathing is the shooting site.
There's not much time.
You have to give me a decision within 3 days.
Before I stick the dogs on you!
Representative Oh.
Yes, Chairman.
I don't know what you mean... The Japanese investor, the broadcasting slot!
How much longer are you going to let Anthony have his way like that?
A hound that had been loyal to its master bites the master.
That guy... what should we do about him?
We must catch him.
Catch him and kill him.
Before he finishes sharpening his fangs in preparation of revenge.
If left alone, he's going to attack me with those fangs.
You'd better make sure that you do it right this time.
There are so many hounds out there to replace you.
Once more... I'll need your help.
When do you have time?
Our guest today is South Korea's most popular, handsome guy, the prince in the drama industry. The top star, everyone who is it?
KANG HYUN MIN!
Korea's best top star, Kang Hyun Min, come on out!
Wow, seriously, your popularity is as high as the sky, Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
Everybody, as you see Kang Hyun Min in person, how do you feel?
He's so hot!
- He's so handsome!
They say you are very good looking.
When I see you here, seriously, the word "sculpture-like handsome guy" used to describe you isn't exaggerated.
Oh, you overpraised me.
Wow, you're even humble.
Indeed, you're the top actor.
How do you feel about all these people coming out to see you ?
Oh, well, of course, I'm very thankful.
Is that so?
Yes, I'm so grateful.
People who love Kang Hyun Min, scream!
Thank you, Thank you.
Kang Hyun Min ssi, I don't think we can do an interview here!
Let's go inside and do the interview.
Shall we?
Because, in this crowd... I just don't think it's possible.
Okay, everyone!
We'll be going in now.
See you guys later!
All your loving fans are still outside.
Your popularity is incredible!
So, I heard you're shooting a new drama.
The drama's called, 'Morning of Kyeongseong' and I am playing the role as 'Kim Woo Jin.'
'Morning of Kyeongseong?
' Wow, the title's very impressive.
So, is there a reason why you chose this drama over others?
Well, let's see...
Reading the script made my whole body shudder.
It gave you the shudders?
I thought this was one drama I should never pass on.
I see... Reading the script gave you the chills.
I'm really looking forward to seeing this drama.
But, on another note...
There's a rumor that you're being paid the most among all actors in the country.
That's right isn't it?
That... is not true. When I select a drama
I do not ever take into account how much I get paid.
I leave all that to my manager so, in truth, I have no idea how much I make.
A drama is a work of art.
I believe that excessive thought of money... can be fatal to an actor.
Wow, 'excessive thought of money can be fatal to an actor?
' You are truly a great actor....
No matter how much I think about it, I'm still angry.
Does it even make sense that a drama is not made melo?
This drama seems better that it's not melo.
Darling, do you think I like melo dramas?
Melo is money... Money!
It has to be melo so people love the drama, and that's exactly how I get CF offers!
Ah, that's right, the director can change that.
The director can change it towards a more melo drama.
Who's our film director, Kwang Soo?
Has it not been decided yet?
Call Anthony and find out.
Who are you dating?
You 'One Night' viewers. (This show)
You bastard!
Yes, you piece of trash.
Did you read the script?
Shut up, you dog!
Please calm down... No matter how much I think about it, I'm too pissed off to calm down.
Why did you just bring me such an impressive script now!
Are you listening to what I'm saying?
You rotton excuse of a human being.
Yes, I'm listening.
Where are you right now? I'll be there as soon as the sun's up tomorrow, so you all better be prepared!
What is going on that we're meeting so early?
I'm a bit worried...
Now, everyone say hello to...
Director Goo Young Mok, who will be directing 'Morning of Kyeongseong.'
It's nice to meet you gentlemen.
I am Goo Young Mok.
What are you doing not applauding?
Who's that dummy over there?
Oh, I'm a new script writer, but not a dummy, Director...
My name is Lee Go Eun.
So you're Lee Go Eun.
You also look like a something' alright.
I look forward to working with you!
Welcome to the team, Director!
Let's all do well.
Hello, Director!
Oh, it's been too long.
Nice to see you again!
Sunbae-nim!
Hello, Sunbae-nim!
Oh, how long has it been?
Have you guys been well?
Yes, yes. Are you excited now that we're in some real chaos,
Crazy Dog?
Could you please not call me 'Crazy Dog' anymore?
Drop the pretense, you punk.
Wow, how long has it been?
Why are you so excited?
This is it, isn't it?
Stop your fussing, you punk.
Aigo. Director!
Welcome back, Director!
It's been a very long time!
So you're the broadcasting director dog now?
You're still the same, Director Goo.
Speaking of which, you're still here?
Ah, Director... Please show me your enthusiasm, just like you did when I first entered the company.
Please take good care of the show.
Ask that to the rating.
Both you and I will die or live depending on that number.
This is the place.
Nice to see you!
Director of Photography!
Wow, how long has it been!
This is the lighting manager.
Wow... how long has it been?
This is the director of photography.
This set is impressive!
Director Goo won't have problems?
There has to be problems.
It makes my heart flutter that my own script will be made into a real drama!
Keep that up with your script, too.
We should have dinner together with the team.
I'll make a reservation at a restaurant near the company.
I'm already meeting someone tonight.
Director Goo is a charming person.
Yes, yes he is.
But don't like him too much.
There's no such thing as a conflictless drama, but there's no such thing as a conflictless set either.
Aigo, Director!
How do you do, Director?
I'm Kang Hyun Min.
I see, you're Hyun Min.
Rascal, you are indeed handsome.
Please make me look good on camera, too.
Sit down, sit down.
I can't tell you how glad we are that you are here, Director.
I would especially like to talk to you about the genre of Noir regarding this drama.
What are your thoughts on the genre?
That's what I like about it.
The fact that it is a fresh genre without the cheesy melancholy.
That's why it really suited me.
You're even good at selecting a good project... I see why you've become such a star, Hyun Min.
Yes. But even though I think that it's okay, in general wouldn't it be good to have a little bit of melo [drama] in it?
Don't pay any attention to that Anthony-like nonsense!
No, no, I don't.
Especially the ending scene of episode 1... is so full of the genre, it's awesome!
Starting with the ending of episode 1, we're going to overwhelm the screen! Hyun Min, your sharp eyes and your sculptured body will be captured by 12 cameras, Action!
Explode!
Jump into the sea!
Flames of fire everywhere. Splashes of water can be heard as you swim across the tall waves.
Close in on the sharp eyes of Kim Jin Woo, and then...
CUT! Director, this is amazing!
The best scene ever in Korean drama history!
What's even more impressive is that we're doing it for real without computer graphics.
Gwang Soo!
By the way, you do know how to swim, right?
Of course. I've been training just in case.
Do you know how to swim in the sea?
Excuse me? The sea? Even though the weather is not ideal, it's not winter yet, so the sea should be okay.
You can do it, right?
Very good.
We should do this as we had originally planned, - Yes.
and if we need more, we can talk later as they come up.
You go and show him.
You should look at this.
Director Goo said to redo the budget for episode 1 according to this...
Everybody, are you ready?
Though it's not alcohol, let's have a toast.
For "Morning of Kyeongseong!"
Oh, Representative Kim, good to see you.
Have a seat. Before that, let's talk outside.
What about this?
You're asking why? Twelve cameras, a helicopter, 1,200 extras, the costs for actors, costumes, and food for filming for 5 days, and even an exploding cruise!
You want to spend over a 1 billion won (~$1million) for just the last 5 minutes of episode 1, are you for real?
Yeah, and so?
What about it?
There's no way we can do that.
Can't do it?
Yes, can't do it.
I want to pour every last drop of my passion into this, why can't we do it?
! Why should I burn my money to fuel your passion, Director?
And if I can't do that?
Then I will be forced to use my last resort.
You're saying you will fire me?
If you won't change your mind, then, yes, I'll fire you.
Don't play around.
You may be the one who brought me on board, but you can't kick me off so easily.
Oh it would be very fun.
Really, what's your personal problem?
If people don't do what you want, you threaten to fire them.
If you don't know, but out since it's not your concern.
Find another director.
Find one!
Even if you have to search the whole country, or the whole world!
If there isn't anyone, create someone!
Yes, Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
Has it been 3 years? Enough with the formalities, you're the representative of the Empire Production.
But who is it this time?
The one you want to teach a lesson?
It's someone you also know very well.
If it's someone I know very well, who is it?
Kang Hyun Min.
Actor Kang Hyun Min?
I'm counting on your help.
Just like when you helped with bringing down Anthony with the media reports 3 years ago.
Just like bringing down Anthony 3 years ago, huh?
Anyhow, why is Kang Hyun Min your target?
If I can't cut off the head of the enemy, I shall cut off his hand that wields the sword.
Me, go in the sea?
Even in the winter?
Does this make any sense?
What kind of a director is he?
He needs to learn to respect his actors.
What if, while shooting the ending of episode 1, something goes wrong like that?
What about the rest of the drama? I'm irreplaceable for this whole business!
Writer, are you listening to what I'm saying?
Well, can't you just go along and do it?
No way! They want to dunk me, Kang Hyun Min, the superstar, into the cold winter sea!
Just do it?
Do you even know what the sea temperature is today?
I even looked it up.
It's 6ºC (43ºF)!
Six degrees! I can't do this.
No, I choose not to!
You call yourself an actor, but the reason why you won't do it is because it's cold?
Yes, it's because it's cold!
I can tolerate a lot of things, but not cold!
Suck it up!
I refuse to suck it up.
Cut out that ending scene of episode 1.
Or fix it so I won't have to swim.
I've got plenty of other mind-wrecking things right now, do you have to add to that, Kang Hyun Min?
You promised.
That you would write for me.
How is that promise related to this issue?
No matter what, I won't go in the sea. Either, talk Director Goo out of it, or change the script.
I'm leaving.
You're implying you'll fire me?
If you don't change your mind, then, yes, I'll fire you.
This is the budget list of episode 1 based on the wishes of Director Goo.
So? !
It can't be produced this way!
I'm going to change the director.
Have you tried reasoning?
He's very stubborn.
Isn't persuasion one of the skills of a producer?
Right? If persuasion doesn't work, then you should increase the budget.
So you're a person without skill, Producer Kim.
In such a circumstance, don't we have to change the producer instead of changing the director?
Right now all the directors said that they can't shoot a drama with you.
In such a case, what do you think will be our choice as a broadcasting station? Representative Kim, if you have no skills, quit.
We will sign a contract with Director Goo directly and make this drama on our own.
Didn't Director Goo contact you perhaps?
And the Representative?
Well, that... he went to the broadcasting station.
It seems like he'll tell them that he's going to fire Director Goo.
Yes, Director Nam.
About "Morning of Kyeongseong"... There is a possibility that we will be producing it ourselves, so please make preparations for that.
In-house production ?
Director, someone is here to see you.
Oh, Writer Lee.
How... is the script-writing going well?
As you may know, there is a bit of a problem between Director Goo and Representative Kim.
But you just need to focus on writing, Writer Lee.
I came because I heard that our Representative was here.
Yes. You'll have heard of it, our Representative and Director Goo, neither of them are willing to give way.
It would be good if you could mediate between them.
Please do us the favour. Well, I gave a final notice to Representative Kim and since you will find it out soon, I'll tell you what's going on.
If Producer Kim can't clear up this situation, we have no choice but to produce "Morning of Kyeongseong" ourselves at SBC.
In-house production?
Yes, in-house production.
So, that means World Production will be excluded from the production team.
Do you really... have to go this far?
Ah, nothing about your role will change, so please don't worry too much.
I'm sorry, but I think producing the drama through World Production is the right choice.
But, why are you on Representative Kim's side?
Are you trying to repay him for reinstating you as the writer?
Representative Kim reinstated me...?
I heard it from the director himself.
He said if it's not Director Goo they are going for in-house production.
It's not for you to interfere.
So are you going to pull out of the production?
That's not for you to worry about either.
I'm asking because I'm curious how you're feeling.
You fired people whom you don't like, but now you're in the other side's situation.
So I'm wondering how you feel, probably it f***ing sucks.
It feels dirty and pathetic, right?
That's why people hate you.
Don't concern yourself.
That's why there is no one left at your side.
I don't need those bastards.
But you said you wanted to make a successful comeback.
To make that success last long, you must not lose people. You don't have any power now, not like when you were in Empire.
What, are the things I said not correct?
Am I not correct? That's right. Making this drama successful and taking the reward from it for my comeback is the purpose of all of these.
And avenging on those people who took away my position and trampled on my power is the reason.
Are they all like that?
People born and raised in wealthy homes and priviledged environments?
Are they all like you?
Why can't you just accept the reality of having fallen to the ground?
Is resenting the world your only option?
So? Did I do anything wrong? You, why on earth did you end up making dramas?
There's no such nonsense as a reason.
You... why on earth did you end up making dramas?
You jerk, what did you say!
If you call me a fatherless son of a b... once more and you keep prattling on about my mother not being able to see, I'll kill you!
What kind of kid is taught that?
Since you're blind, I can't tell you to look (at my son's face).
What are you going to do about my son's face?
It's my fault, because I'm so lacking.
Why are you not apologizing?
I'm speechless!
I'm going to report you to the police!
The likes of this one should eat beany rice.
Eun Seok's mother!
Eun Seok's mother?
The expert already confirmed it.
This suicide doesn't make sense...
["The Head of Detectives" - a famous Korean cop series in 1971~1989.]
The test result came out.
Stature, age, blood type, they all did not match.
- What about the fingerprints?
Pay attention to the... Good job, you're doing well.
Did you find Director Goo?
Yes, he's in the Bongcheondong neighborhood.
I'll send you his location.
Give me a bottle of soju, please.
What business do you have here?
Are you going back to your cottage?
Get lost.
You bastard, what the heck are you doing!
All in all, 1.05 billion Won.
This is the money you need to shoot the final scene of 5 minutes you want to shoot.
What game are you playing?
Those 5 minutes... shoot them.
In exchange I'll ask you one thing.
What is this drama to you?
Nothing will change. "Morning of Kyeongsang" is my last drama!
It's the foundation for the next 10 years of your career.
I don't care about your sweet-talks about the future!
Each episode is 60 minutes, so 1200 minutes in total. Spending 1 billion on 5 minutes makes the remaining 1195 minutes a stretch.
No, this way your future 10 years disappear. For those momentary five minutes, please don't throw away your glorious 10 years.
And five years ago don't forget the day when you hit rock bottom.
Hey you crazy bastard!
If I give up on those five minutes, what are you going to give me?
The 5 lost years that you want to forget I will turn them into the joy of success.
Cleanly, without a trace. Hey punk,
I told you to throw that bluff away first.
If it's a bluff or not, you will see when the time comes.
Director, about that Director Goo and Anthony...
What about Anthony? Director, about that Director Goo and Anthony... What about Anthony?
Well, looks like Anthony has worked the kinks out with Director Goo, so everything is in working order now! In working order?
Sounded like Anthony was able to persuade Director Goo.
It seems like... Anthony has changed somewhat.. He's a different man now...
What a strange world. Alright, I see... Director Goo, huh?
What?
Yes, I decided to curb down my ambitions. That is a great decision, Director!
But what made you change your mind? Nothing special, it's just 5 minutes, not worth throwing out 10 years' worth of glory.
Wow, I'm so impressed!
Impressed?
Once you have enough experience, you'll become more sensible, too, Writer Lee.
At any rate, I heard that Hyun Min refuses to do it?
Yes, he says swimming in the sea is too dangerous and difficult for him.
He asked me to change the script if we couldn't change your mind.
So it's too much for Hyun Min, huh?
What time is the appointment with Hyun Min?
I'll get to the point right away with Director Goo, and you need to chime in right then.
You have to stand your ground. Be firm.
I said I understood.
Let's go, Sparta.
Get that thing ready, please.
Yes, I see.
Director, I heard that you like to drink.
So we prepared a special gift for you.
Oh, we didn't know.... Well then, instead of wine... Nah, it's ok.
As long as I don't drink. Here I'll pour you a glass.
About the ending scene of episode 1, the way I see it, there is something that bothers me.
We're thinking that the scale is rather unrealistic...
I was a bit overly excited about that.
That's right, Director!
It was overly unrealistic, indeed!
Nowadays, the computergraphic technology is so advanced, you can just do that.
You can just shoot it in an artificial pool, there's no need to do it in real sea water.
That's so old fashioned.
I meant that my ambitions went over our budget.
Then, how are we doing that scene?
Even if we turn down the scale, we should still film at sea.
Um, Director, what do you mean by that?
No matter what, we've got to shoot Kang Hyun Min swimming in the sea.
Forget the clown that just poses in front of the camera for good looks, we're going to turn you into a serious actor with a tenacious passion.
Don't you want to stop being a clown and start becoming a real actor?
I cannot accept that.
Hyun, Hyun Min!
The wilder the dog, once tamed, turns into something great.
Give me just a moment, Director.
Hyung, how did it go?
Tell them they won't see me until they get this thing sorted out!
You can't just storm out like this!
Come back in, let's talk to the Director... Even if I die I'm not going back in, so shut the door and GET LOST!
Alright, then.
You're not getting out?
If you don't get off, I won't get out either even if I die.
They just took off.
I also saw with my own eyes that he had a drink.
I understand. You've worked hard.
Get started with our arrangements.
Yes, I understand.
I heard that you and Director Goo have reached an agreement.
Were you sincere in saying it's a relief? I'm just dying to know, how did you do it?
Neither Director Goo nor you, Representative Kim, are known for compromising their positions.
I don't think I'm obliged to divulge that information to you.
"A clown that poses in front of the camera for a few good looking shots"?
"Turn me into a real actor"?
How dare he say that to me, Kang Hyun Min!
Don't you agree?
Why couldn't he say that?
Don't even think about going back and hiding in a pension in Yangpyeong to play video games.
Turn the car around.
I know you don't really have anywhere else to go.
Why are you like this?
You're like a kid whining to his mom whenever something goes wrong.
Why wouldn't I have anywhere to go?
Then where?
Where would you go?
I'll go see my mom!
What? Ouch!
Man, everything is just driving me crazy!
Aigo, what do I do?
Aish, darn it!
Shouldn't we get out?
Oh, are you alright?
Why do something that'll make you sorry?
Let the insurance company take care of it.
Ah yes, we shall do that.
Oh, by the way, aren't you Kang Hyun Min?
Never mind. Just give me your contact info.
Man, what a hassle!
Just a fender-bender. I rear-ended his car.
Oh, is that so?
Have you reached an agreement?
Ah, but I think he has been drinking.
Drinking? Sunbae-nim, I'm sure your project's going well.
It's all thanks to your skills.
What bad news?
Kang Hyun Min just got caught for drunk driving.
His blood-alcohol content is enough to get his license suspended.
Ah, where is this?
Hello, Lee Go Eun?
SAY SOMETHING, Lee Go Eun!
Preview
Tell me! How did this happen? If we let Kang Hyun Min resume his role, the public will criticize our whole broadcasting station.
Shouldn't you partner up with someone more trustable?
Let's replace Kang Hyun Min with a different actor.
I heard that Writer Lee Go Eun isn't doing so well, either, so both writer and actor should be replaced.
I'm just asking for some time!
Carzy Dog, we need Song Bit Na. Absolutely.
I think everything was a set up, not a coincidence.
Oh Jin Wan.
Ah, you're firing me, Kang Hyun Min?
If we don't get this worked out in three days, we're doomed!
Ah, I don't know, I don't know I'm going crazy!
The only person who can solve this problem is your mother.
You know, my tummy aches too much, Doctor.
She doesn't have any external injuries or any special symptoms, why hasn't she woken up yet?
The question is.. whether there is brain damage.
Do... I know that person, too?
Why do you not know me?
You absolutely must remember me!
Even if you have to use the power of hatred, just remember me, Lee Go Eun!
Episode 7 Asphalt Gladiator Outpatient Reception AdmissionDischarge Protocols Come to your senses, Lee Go Eun!
Tell me! How did this happen? !
While the cops caught me for drunk driving, she was on the phone, and then... it all happened so quickly. Go Eun! - Go Eun!
- Wait, we have to get her to a scanner right away.
Go Eun, why?
Go Eun!
Why is my kid lying there unconscious?
I'm sorry. If by any chance, something happens to my child, I am really going to KILL you!
Kang Hyun Min!
What is your take on the situation?
Please, even a sentence will do!
Mr. Kang Hyun Min, would you please explain your drunk driving charge?
Is it true that you were fully drunk, and that your license is suspended?
What kind of effects do you foresee on your acting career?
Kang Hyun Min Drinking and Driving Can he do the drama?
How in the world can he drive while drunk right before his new drama is about to start?
If we let Kang Hyun Min keep his role, the whole public might criticize our broadcasting station.
Well, so... what does the chief producer in charge think?
Since shooting hasn't even started yet, I don't think we need the risk of such a controversial actor...
So you want to cut him off?
He's done it to himself!
So, just because the media is criticizing him, you want to jump on the wagon and end his career, too?
I cannot abandon my actor like that!
Replace the actor?
Let's replace Kang Hyun Min with a different actor.
It doesn't make sense to keep Kang Hyun Min when the public sentiment is in such an uproar.
Plus, it's not just my personal opinion, but the whole drama department's opinion.
Is it because of the contract fee that you've paid him in advance?
We can't take the risk of his ruined reputation affecting our business just to accommodate your financial situation.
I've also heard that Writer Lee Go Eun is not doing well, either.
I think it's better to replace both the writer and actor this time.
Please, give me some time.
Replace them at once.
Just give me some time!
Resolve all this in 3 days.
If you don't resolve this in 3 days, no matter how much financial loss may incur, we replace them both.
There's no way that Anthony would want to replace Kang Hyun Min and forfeit the 2 billion won he paid him.
Besides, there's no other actor to replace him with.
Moreover, the writer is in a coma. In short, "Morning of Kyeongseong" is beyond repair at this point.
So, what is it you want?
If "Morning of Kyeongseong" is a no go, wouldn't the Empire's "Elegant Revenge 2" be a good sub for it?
I know very well that you had lent Anthony a hand, Assistant Director.
Forgive me for saying this, but why don't you lend that hand to someone more reliable?
Someone who can really be a big help when you're in need.
Look at them all.
Such vultures.
They don't care about the person who got injured, but only about Kang Hyun Min if he's coming or not.
How heartless they are!
At any rate, I hope Writer Lee wakes up from her coma.
What a disaster this is.
She doesn't have any serious external injuries or odd symptoms.
Why isn't she up yet?
The question is whether there is any brain damage.
Once we take a look at her brain scans, we'll have more information, but at this point, it's hard to say.
What are you so excited about?
Well, we're really getting started with the project now!
I know very well that the fate of not just me and you, but everybody involved with this drama depends on the choices I make.
That's why I can't give up.
We'll have victory for sure!
What percentage is your confidence rating?
You always said to me, "Believe me."
This time, it's your turn to believe me, Representative.
I'll stay here, so you guys can go back to work.
No, we'll wait here, too, until she wakes up.
Yeah, even if I tried to work, I don't think I'll be able to focus on it.
Are we going to collapse here?
Are we going to collapse, throwing a fit like a whiny kid?
Lee Go Eun will wake up.
Absolutely.
Get back to work so that we can start shooting with her script right away.
What is it that you have to say?
About the drunk driving incident of Mr. Kang Hyun Min....
-Representative!
The first news report of Kang Hyun Min's drunk driving charge was written by Reporter Park Seong Bok of Daehan Daily.
What, Park Seong Bok?
The same reporter who had written that calumnious report about the death of the delivery man 3 years ago.
It was also Reporter Park who rear-ended Kang Hyun Min's car.
I think it was all a scheme, not a coincidence.
Oh Jin Wan!
You can't go in!
Representative... please leave.
Move out the way, unless you wish to die.
Didn't I warn you that I was going to win this...
You want to be sued?
Then do it.
Oh Jin Wan, I'm warning you!
You can do anything to me, but you can't touch my actor, my writer, my people.
Since when did Anthony, to whom the end justified any means, become an advocate of justice?
I learned it all from you.
In order to get what I want, I have to be cold-blooded and merciless, extinguishing every last ray of hope!
Then, here's another lesson for you!
A death match is only between gladiators.
PD Joo?
Representative, I'm calling to inform you about Lee Go Eun.
Deputy Director... it's me.
What I told you to do, I think you should hurry up and proceed with it.
The CT, did it come out okay?
Um, about that... She woke up, but... Lee Go Eun, are you okay?
Do I know him as well?
You really don't know me?
Why don't you know me?
Anthony who buried you in this field 3 years ago after only using you, and later threw you away again without mercy! It's me, Anthony!
Do you even forget your hatred and resentment towards me?
You must remember me.
Even if you have to use the power of hatred you must remember me, Lee Go Eun!
So you do know that.
How mean you have been to me!
Always you were the one who tricked people, but now how do you feel being fooled?
Do you think I fell for such a clumsy act of yours?
I'm sorry but I have been producing dramas for the last 10 years.
I have used the "amnesia" plot more than 100 times.
And also, you... were the worst among all of the amnesia acting I've seen.
So if you have time to make this kind of petty joke, use that time to write scripts!
PD Joo already brought me my laptop anyway!
Hey, Go Eun! I brought your favorite, grilled mackerel....
PD Joo, make sure Writer Lee gets everything she needs.
By the way, you totally fell for it earlier, didn't you?
I have never seen you being like that before, Representative.
So... you mean "Elegant Revenge 2" of Empire Production?
It's not easy to find a top actor who is available for shooting now. And moreover,
Empire Production has finished its set-up for shooting with the casting of Kim Jin Woo.
Kim Jin Woo?
That's why it's Empire Production, isn't it?
Even if we wait one or two days more, it's not like any great option will suddenly pop up.
If there is no change after 3 days, I will reconsider the project. Since Writer Lee Go Eun is conscious now, I'm very relieved then..
I really drank just one shot, but a license suspension? Those articles are all lies!
That breathalyzer was obviously manipulated!
It's not the time to whine that you're wronged!
Whine?
Representative... If even you are treating me like this...
Do you know why you were casted?
Because you're good at acting?
Because I like you personally?
No, it was because the station would give me the broadcasting schedule if I brought you.
But because of your reckless behavior, we're now in a crisis and there is no other actor to immediately replace you either.
If we don't solve this issue within three days, all of us are finished!
What do you mean "finished"?
Is it decided at the broadcasting station?
You will fire me?
Me, Kang Hyun Min?
What... should we do now?
Did you request the blood test?
I'm not sure its result from National Forensic Service will come out within three days.
Hyung... It's Bit Na, but she says your cell phone is turned off so...
Tell her I'll call later.
Then, what are you doing for media play?
That's, well...
Hyung... it's your mother... Oh my god, seriously!
Do you think your stomachache is a big deal now?
Aren't you watching TV, Mom?
Right at the moment when you had a stomachache and went to the ER, I had a big accident, too!
Let's talk later, bye!
Watch your language to your mother!
She's my mom, but she doesn't even have a clue what happened to her son.
She's nagging why I'm not visiting her when she has a stomachache.
Then, you should visit her!
The only person who will resolve this situation is your mom.
Well, from now on, our new script will begin.
Hyun Min, you should lower your head as much as possible.
Representative Choi and Kwang Soo, you guys make a way for Hyun Min, with the sincere mind to help him visiting his sick mother quickly.
Hyun Min's mother had a little bit of stomachache and went to ER around at 6PM yesterday.
She's goes to the ER so often just like she would visit her spa for a massage.
So the doctors get so frustrated when they see my mom's name.
She came again? That's because when they look at her, she looks too fine.
So, can you tell me which pain brought you here again?
The stomach.
My stomach really hurts, Doctor.
But last night, to run to your sick mother at ER, you had no choice but to drive. But, yesterday, Hyun Min's mother left the ER at 7 PM.
And the time of my accident was later than 8PM.
That's why we should make a story.
Hyun Min got a phone call before that and ran to the hospital!
Mom left the hospital with a doctor's facile prescription.
But then, Bam!
Then, today?
Hyun Min's mother's symptom, which wasn't serious yesterday, became serious today!
Hyun Min...
You and I, the fate of us is all depends on your mother's acting today.
Where do you feel the pain?
Ma'am, where is your pain, tell me!
Bring doctors!
It hurts, hurts, hurts!
For now, take CT scans!
Oh, my tummy!
Aigoo!
Mom! Mr. Kang Hyun Min!
Mr. Kang Hyun Min had an accident on his way here yesterday, so he couldn't come sooner.
I heard that she complained about serious stomach pain yesterday, too.
Uh.... yes, yes, yes.
Then, Mr. Kang Hyun Min's DUI last night was because of an emergency with his mother's health?
Then, Mr. Kang Hyun Min's DUI last night was because of an emergency with his mother's health? Why didn't he explain that sooner?
Listen, people, this is a hospital.
Contain yourselves.
Does the mother of Kr. Kang Hyun Min know, too?
We're waiting for the lab results currently.
Do you have any predictions about her diagnosis?
Mr. Kang Hyun Min will have a press conference to answer all these questions.
Please leave now.
This smells fishy...
Fishy?
When is Kang Hyun Min's press conference?
This coming Friday.
No one must know about our plan.
Therefore, make sure that your mother, Representative Choi, and Gwang Soo all zip it up.
We must keep this secret especially from Lee Go Eun, who'll write your apology to be read at the conference.
Even from Writer Lee Go Eun?
But she's one of us, though?
She is one of us, but she can't be one of us when we're lying.
What do you think she'd do if she found out about our dishonest plan?
At times, the enemy within us can do the most damage.
Never, never must she know!
The mother of Mr. Kang Hyun Min is ill?
Last night, she couldn't keep anything down even.
Her stomach was in such a pain... Then, when you said that you were going to see your mother... you were being serious?
I know you don't have anywhere else to go, why are you being like this?
You're like a kid whining to his mom when something goes wrong!
Why wouldn't I have anywhere else to go?
I'm going to see my mom!
I'm so sorry, I didn't know...
I'm sorry for not even contacting you when you woke up.
I had no idea that Kang Hyun Min's mother was ill.
At least the media reports are sympathetic toward Kang Hyun Min.
Great relief indeed, now that Writer Lee is also recovering swiftly.
At any rate, that bastard Representative Oh has reserved a spot in hell.
Attacking Kang Hyun Min's career with the DUI charge was all his doing.
Man, the bad karma between our Representative Kim and Representative Oh...
Could it be that they were a married couple in their previous life?
Why else would they be such enemies?
Why have you been ignoring my calls?
Is there someone beside you?
I'd like you to find out one more thing.
See if the mother of Kang Hyun Min is really ill.
Do you really have to go this far?
Are you getting cold feet now?
Writer Lee could have been seriously injured!
Why do you think I planned this whole thing with Kang Hyun Min's DUI?
My target is Anthony.
Kang Hyun Min's DUI was just one of the means to get to that end.
Lee Go Eun is just an unexpected, unfortunate casualty.
I don't care who gets hurt and whose career gets ruined.
Whatever you say, I can't.... If something goes wrong, do you think you'll be safe?
If I expose that you were my mole, your career in this field will be totally over.
Do you really think Anthony made it up?
It's not like I committed a serious crime, why do I have to do this?
Regardless of the circumstances, you did drink and drive.
You've betrayed the trust of the public that have loved you, and you've hurt their feelings.
This is not just for show.
Unless you sincerely repent, this whole thing is pointless!
Did I ever ask them to love me?
They just fell head over heels for me because I'm so hot!
Yes, you're hot.
So you can also make a hot apology.
Unless you want to ruin your career.
Happy about what?
You need to practice.
Practice until it hurts.
I think you should lower your gaze slightly before moving on to the next words.
I am only what I am thanks to the love I receive from the public, and I express my deepest regrets for betraying the trust of so many fans.
Good. Next.
I do not want to try to justify my actions of that day with my personal circumstances...
You have to show a surge of emotions.
Think of your mom and pause.
...with my personal circumstances.
Nah, too weak.
Go again!
I will accept all criticisms for my actions and use them to drive myself to become a better person.
You think it was staged?
Well, I wouldn't put it past Anthony if he's desperate enough.
Listen, what if Anthony just wanted to calm down the public sentiment by staging a health issue with Kang Hyun Min's mother who is not sick at all?
Moreover, what if the truth came out?
This would certainly harm the reputation of our station!
Yes, I understand.
Would Kang Hyun Min really gamble his whole career like that?
Listen, Director Nam. The actor's career depends on the impression the public has of him.
There's nothing he couldn't do to restore his ruined reputation.
Alright, I see.
If, as you say, Assistant Director, the issue turns out to be staged, then... I will take away the broadcasting slot from "Morning of Kyeongseong."
Got it? When answering questions about your mother, don't hesitate.
You'll look more dejected. Still,
I think we need to be clear about the issue with my mom.
Too much water drowns the miller.
Who's going to drown? Mom did go to the ER that day, and she's in the hospital. Mom did go to the ER that day, and she's in the hospital.
If people find out that your mother is a fake patient, everything is over.
It will be totally over for you and me both, forever.
Make no mistakes.
The fate of you, me, and our drama depends on today.
Fate?
Was I right?
Did you record their conversation as I told you to?
Good. Send me a copy of that file, and I'll text you Director Heo's phone number, so send him a copy, too.
You still remember... what I told you, right?
If you want to live, just do as I say.
Just a moment, can we talk privately?
Since we're busy now, let's talk later.
This is the cell number of Director Heo.
Yes, yes....
The blood test result of Hyun min came out.
It's 0.04 and lower than the limit!
Now, we just need to finish this press conference well.
Oh, thank you Jesus!
I, Kang Hyun min, have lived getting generous love from all the people for the last several years.
Why has that file not been sent yet?
That was... because my cell phone wasn't fully charged until now.
I will send you that file now. If someone has too many thoughts, he loses many things as well, you know. You know what I mean, don't you?
In addition, for all the difficulties the production team of "Morning of Kyeongseong" had to go through because of me, I'm giving my sincere apology to them.
So I drove the car myself.
[Voice message]
[Voice message] However, about my personal situation, I don't want to make any excuses.
Writer Lee could've been in a really dangerous situation.
Why do you think I planned Kang Hyun Min's DUI?
Kang Hyun Min's DUI case is just one of all means to hit that target.
Lee Go Eun was just an unexpected, scapegoat.
I don't care who gets hurt, or who would be doomed.
Woo Hee Jae, this bastard!
This is the cell number of Director Heo.
What were you trying to say?
I'm sorry, Representative.
In return, you do only what I tell you to do.
Writer Lee could've been really in a danger.
Representitive!
That depends on how you behave from now on.
If you keep digging into Hyun Min's mother's case, I will reveal this file.
Then, the public will criticize you, and Chairman will fire you who ruins the reputation of the company, just like he did fire me 3 years ago.
Are you saying to make a deal with me?
So you're not as dumb as I thought.
Oh, and one more.
Through all medias you're dealing with, friendly opinions about Hyun Min will be poured out.
We will finish our press conference now.
How was I?
Was I good?
You were bada**! Especially when you lowered your head for a moment, then, as you continued to talk, with tears...! It was art!
I had especially worked on that part.
Where is Anthony, anyway?
What is the reaction of the reporters?
Much better than I had expected.
They're already releasing sympathetic news reports.
- Applause!
- But let me make one thing clear.
I swear, I don't care what kind of a life you lead.
What did that loony say?
Did you understand him?
I sure didn't!
Well, considering the blood test results and all, I think it's ok to keep Kang Hyun Min on board.
It's too early to tell yet.
What's important is the public opinion. Correct. The numbers may be legally acceptable, but it's still true that he drove after drinking alcohol.
I think it would be wise to watch the movement of the public opinion.
Yes, - Director.
I reviewed the reactions of the media reports and the netizens.
The voice of sympathy is decidedly predominant.
Then, as planned, the November slot is reserved for "Morning of Kyeongseong" with Kang Hyun Min.
Oh, Hyung, look at this!
Scroll up, up, up, oh, this one!
This one! Oh yes, that's a good one!
Nice shot!
It looks like you were crying.
Really crying!
That tear is a real tear.
It's worth a million dollars.
Take a look at this, Director.
Our Hyun Min Oppa must have been in so much pain!
The netizens keep posting comments.
Hyun Min Oppa's big heart is public knowledge.
As you see, the public opinion about Kang Hyun Min is changed 180 degrees overnight.
Right now, netizens are signing petitions to go against Kang Hyun Min being fired.
Are you Writer Lee Go Eun?
I'm Hyun Min's mother.
If you're Hyun Min's mother...
Kang Hyun Min...?
Superstar Kang Hyun Min's mother.
You're still weak, stay sitting!
You're even more sick than I am; I can't stay sitting.
Well, I am sick.
Even if I'm a fake patient.
Flowers?
We've decided to go with Kang Hyun Min as previously planned.
You don't seem too happy.
No, I am happy.
By any chance, is this what you've already anticipated?
No, nevermind. Then, see you later.
The station's drama department decided to keep Kang Hyun Min.
What is that reaction?
Do you have something you haven't told me?
Something I haven't told you?
Kang Hyun Min's mother just came by.
How could you trick me like that?
It's fine now that you know.
How can you say something like that?
If I told you honestly, would you have agreed obediently?
I would never have participated in such a farce!
No, I would've dissuade you not to do that!
See!
You're really immoral.
Turning someone's perfectly fine mother into a seriously ill person in a second wasn't enough?
Someday, she will be seriously ill, I guess.
For your drama, you've thrown away your father, now it's your mother?
Because a husband and a wife are equal.
I don't even want to look at you, so get out!
I'm busy anyway, so I can't stay longer.
Ah, that devil!
This devil will go back to home to Hell now, so you'd better write the script for episode 6.
Is he crazy or something?
This is the letter Hee Jae left.
Without saying anything, he said he's going to resign for personal reasons.
To Writer Lee Go Eun? Representative, I'm not brave enough to meet you in person, so I'm telling you like this.
I know that very well.
So I, somebody pathetic, will be leaving.
Our writer's precious drama, "Morning of Kyeongseong"
I will pray that it will be successful.
Be healthy.
Writer Lee!
You've been well?
You must still be sick; you should have told us before you came.
You want me to forgive him?
I know you're really disappointed and angry, but can't you forgive him?
A person who betrays once will betray again.
You make a mistake once.
And Hee Jae, he's having a hard time, living with his sick grandma these days.
That's why he must have been greedy from his youthful passion.
He's regretting it right now.
What does that have to do with me?
He's already fired.
So don't butt into my business, and you do your work.
Why did he get fired?
Actually, I don't really know myself.
That bastard... even when I ask, he doesn't reply.
He doesn't even pick up his phone anymore.
Do you possibly know his address?
Do you possibly know this house, #30?
We don't have any coffee mugs... No, it's fine.
This is good too.
By the way, where's Hee Jae?
He hasn't come home from work yet.
It's about time for him to come home.
By the way, didn't you say you're working with him?
Oh, I'm on a vacation.
It's so strange today.
A lot of people from work visited.
Wh... Who was it?
They didn't tell me their name, but... they said to send this on to him.
Ah Grandma, do you mind if I read that? Yes, yes. Because of my eyesight, even if I read it, I wouldn't know what it was about.
Shut up and come to work early, before I really fire you.
Grandmother, I'm here.
Writer Lee.
[Loony]
Whatever I'm doing, why do you have to know that?
Have you reconsidered about Hee Jae?
That betrayer will come to work again.
Earlier, he came to me and begged me to let him work again, crying over and over.
So, is that the reason you took him back?
No, I just decided to use him for only three months.
Don't worry about useless things, and if you have time to make a call, just write scripts.
One more thing.
Why did you lie?
Are you talking about that again?
Reinstating me as a writer was done by you, not the Director of the Drama Department.
Why did you lie? I guess you heard some weird rumor, but stop talking nonsense, and just write more scripts.
Because I'm blind, I only see you.
Because my heart is frozen, I hug you.
When my trembling lips touch your ears, I say the words I dreamed of ...
Since I first met you, I love you.
Who are you, huh?
This brat!
Welcome back!
...those words that came out as tears little by little, fill up my heart as if my heart will explode with those words.
Because both of my eyes are blinded,
Okay, then let's go for our other half face, the main female actress.
Kim Ah Joong will work a movie with 16 million won budget next month.
And Lee Bo Young is staying abroad now after finishing the last drama so successfully.
She says she will never work with Kang Hyun Min, even if she dies.
Why is Sung Min Ah not on this list?
I heard her schedule is available as well.
That's because... she's an actress of Empire Production.
She can't work with us because she belongs to Empire?
Yes, because our company is not on good terms with Empire.
More accurately, Anthony and Oh Jin Wan are enemies so it won't work, right?
No matter what.
Look at me now (In French)
Wow, you are too good.
Miss Min Ah, you're fantastic, yes, great!
Great pose, ok, yes! Now, ready, 1,2. Good!
It's done for today.
- You all worked hard.
Miss Min Ah, you were amazing today, as always.
I didn't do much.
It's all thanks to your great work of photography.
Aigoo, you're even modest!
Sung Min Ah is indeed the best.
Thanks for your work today.
Don't you ever schedule another shoot with that man.
Did he do something wrong?
I can't concentrate because of his bad breath!
Alright, I'll look into it.
A skilled photographer who doesn't have bad breath, ok?
Why don't you guys go ahead.
You're still good at surprising people.
It's the script for the mini series for November Mondays and Tuesdays of S Broadcasting.
I did hear that you were broke.
I guess that means your scale has shrunk, too?
For you to offer me a script of a rookie writer.
Compared to the pathetic writers of Empire who haven't written anything worthy of the return of Sung Min Ah for the past three years, it's completely different.
In addition to writers, I also screen producers.
Is there anything else you need to know about me?
How much are you going to pay me?
You can't afford that, ever.
Sure I can. Because you're the best actress, Sung Min Ah.
Read it carefully and give me a call.
My number hasn't changed.
Who... Who is it?
Did I startle you?
I'm just teasing.
Quite spacious for a writer's studio.
About the same size as... the second bathroom of my living room.
Quit mocking, it's my very first studio.
Well, just, uhm...
I thought I'd check out the writer's studio.
I heard that... you saw my mom.
I also received great words of wisdom.
Hey, you know it was inevitable.
I normally don't say thank you very often.
I truly appreciate what you did this time.
I feel as if...
I found a new friend.
Then, be good from now on.
Yeah, about that...
Wouldn't it be better to take out that swimming at sea part?
I'd love it if that part was cut out from the whole script!
I don't know about the others, but you absolutely have to swim in the ocean.
You said you can afford to pay me because I'm the best actress there is.
Then, let me ask you one thing.
Do you still... love me?
If you would act for "Morning of Kyeongseong."
Preview Ep 8 How much longer do I have to bathe those filthy brats?
Episode 8 Reinforcements Will Not Come Hyung, why is he so late returning? That's what I'm saying.
It has already been for more than 5 hours since he left to meet her. Um... Representative?
What? It's nothing. PD Joo.
Quickly write a news release and circulate it to these media companies I checked, the first thing in the morning tomorrow.
But... what article are you talking about?
The title is like this:
Sung Min Ah confirmed as "Morning in Kyeongseong's" lead actress.
An article about Sung Min Ah joining our drama?
Sung Min Ah has decided to do our drama.
Quickly get started on writing the news release. Good work,
Crazy Dog.
Are you now ready to taste that joy?
It's now satisfactory.
What say you, feeling good?
The best, that's my feeling. Even if Anthony is very nasty and mean, if you look into him, isn't he a pretty okay producer?
Sometimes I want to beat him up, but like today he's quite an okay producer.
By the way, when was the last time you took a bath?
I bathe everyday.
But I'm not scrubbing often.
No wonder...
How can it be a human body?
This is an eraser!
Just kidding around.
Bath over!
Bye-bye Hyun Woo.
Don't catch a cold.
Oh, really nice!
Teacher, please let me take a break for a moment.
We're just going to the bathroom for a second.
For how long do I have to wash dirty, dead skinned rascals?
You decided to do volunteer work for the meaning of self-reflection.
Do you think I'm asking because I don't know?
! It would be enough to just shoot a few photos.
How much are you going to push me?
! You, listen to me carefully.
My hair?
Right. Even if you have to show them shaving your hair, you have to show them that you're self-reflecting.
I'll just scrub off dead skin.
Scrub it off with all your might.
I told you to eat it.
If he gives you something to eat, you should eat it.
Sung Min Ah?
Are you saying that Sung Min Ah got casted?
Korea's top star, Kang Hyun Min with the best, Sung Min Ah.
We have the best casting combination, right?
Seems like you should come back. The kids are getting cold waiting.
Ok, all right.
I'll go and scrub off those erasers.
Even if I don't know anything else but this. Even if I don't know anything else but this.
With Anthony's drama you definitely can't.
Are you asking because you don't know?
! You always said this when I was a rookie.
This is a royal order.
Shut your mouth and do what I tell you.
Now I give the royal orders.
Meet all the conditions they request, and proceed the contract.
I definitely told you.
I told you to proceed with the contract.
Why on earth are you being like this?
Have you forgotten what Anthony did to you?
! One more thing.
Don't ask me for my reasons from now on.
If you want to continue to keep me under contract.
Our affiliated actress Sung Min Ah is doing Anthony's drama?
Even though I told her no, it's what she wants.
No matter what it takes, I will stop her from acting in that drama.
Let her have her way.
What do you mean...
The attack is allowed just once.
In this one opportunity, it's important to go for the kill.
If you say "the only opportunity of attack"..?
Where did you say the investor of Anthony's drama was?
Topstar Sung Min Ah confirmed for 'Morning in Kyeongseong'
Set up the date for the script practice session and the drama press conference on 19th.
Kang Hyun Min Sung Min Ah
Lead actor and actress of 'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Notify the schedule to all media companies, actors, actresses and staffs.
Sung Min Ah's drama comeback after 3 years Don't forget to send an invitation respectfully to Watanabe Group, the investor.
Drama "Morning in Kyeongseong" ultra-luxury casting Yes, Reporter Park.
This is World Production calling.
I'm sorry but as it was too urgent.
How is it going with our invitation cards?
Yes, please send them by 12PM.
The sun has risen a while ago.
Stop sleeping, get up and get ready to go out.
Sung Min Ah said she wanted to meet you.
Sung Min Ah?
What is Sung Min Ah's character like?
Probably better than yours.
I read from an article that she is very thoughtful.
Hello! I'm Lee Go Eun.
You're younger than I thought.
Alright, let's get some fresh air. You two have a chat.
I read and liked the script.
It's been a long time since a script made me greedy like this one.
I'm talking about episode one.
Don't you think that's too much of the theme?
Too much of the theme?
"A man's sorrowful life story who lives in the dark age."
The theme should thicken as time passes, not shown all at once like that.
That's why I decided to start by explaining the background with the characters around the main guy.
Then... The role of Jin Hye Rim I'm taking on, she's not at all in episode one and appears last in episode two.
If you brought an actress who is paid many tens of thousands won, you have to show her for the amount of time that fits her price.
What are you imply...
The female lead isn't the male lead's maid of honour.
To fit the name of Sung Min Ah, revise the script starting with episode one.
I fully understand what you've said.
But the planned story line is...
Writer Lee.
Under whom did you learn?
Why are you asking?
Just like I thought, you really smack of a rookie writer.
I will make this clear.
You did not cast me.
I chose you. No, I chose this drama.
So right now I'm not asking a favour.
I am not trying to give you advice either.
So you're saying right now that we don't have a choice?
It seems you're not too much of a fool.
Do you always crush writers like that?
I didn't need to.
The writers I worked with up to now were veterans.
So they were aware and did all that was needed.
The rookie writer who knows nothing will only say one thing.
This drama is not a drama for you alone.
Even if it's for Sung Min Ah, I can't fix even one character.
You can't fix it?
For an actor who is full of egoistic pride and doesn't think about the whole drama it's unnecessary.
You look like you ended your chat well...
You knew, right?
Do you know what Sung Min Ah said to me?
What could she have said. To match the role to the worth of her name.
By bringing me even when you knew that, I guess you tried to shake up my script again with the actress this time? Do you think that way?
I was wrong for trusting you.
So... what have you decided to do?
Who did you say was the new director of S Broadcasting?
Okay, let's see.
Oh. Make it possible to film this part also.
There will be a hidden scene behind the building.
Good, I think it's done here, so...
Let's go to Jin Hye Rim's room.
Oh, Writer Lee!
Oh, why are you here instead of writing?
So it's like that.
What's the best thing to do, Director?
What did Crazy Dog say?
It's useless to hear from him. They planned together to change up my script.
Actors and actresses are so weird.
Sometimes, they run into the fire for their pieces, and... even with not eating and staying up all night, they dedicate to their roles. But what I'm saying is this.
There is something that the actors never give up.
The tenacity toward their roles.
In other words, they never step back when it's about getting their portion.
Why is it like that?
That's just their nature.
With the natural tenacity they have, they accomplish their jobs.
They are like animals with the only instinct for acting.
Then can't we change their instinct?
Changing the instinct...
That's difficult even for me.
All these are part of the struggles.
I wish you a good luck.
Ah, Writer Lee. Come in.
So, I'll get going.
Are you?
No need to see me off.
I'll contact you.
Writer Lee, have a seat.
I heard briefly about it.
I myself am a drama creator also, so I sympathise with your point of view and I'm rooting for you.
But now I'll talk to you as the director of this drama's broadcasting station.
Sung Min Ah is an actress which all broadcasters want to acquire.
You know that, right?
Sung Min Ah's demand is a demand that is totally understandable from the point of view of a lead actress.
I hope you consider this point.
Did you listen well to what the broadcasting director said?
Do you have to use your strength to pressure me like that?
If I say that I do.
Let's talk for a while, us.
Our conversation is possible after the revised script comes out.
I clearly told you, I have not agreed to modifying the script.
Don't act up.
Your talent is quite something.
First Writer Lee Go Eun, now even up to Sung Min Ah.
You return the people whom you threw away coldly back to your people.
You don't personally need to get an inferiority complex. If there is one thing that I don't have, it would be the inferiority complex that you stupidly grasp on.
That's not an inferiority complex, it's called fury.
Don't make the mistake of thinking that you've already won.
I never tried to win against you. I am not doing that now, nor will I ever do that.
Someone like you can't become my target.
You're my target.
Then someone who failed with the target right in front of him, must be feeling frustrated.
Laugh as much as you can while it lasts.
There will be a day when you will be stomped on severely.
Sang Tae Gu.
This is also so-so. Something else.
Bit Na.
You said this Oppa is awesome in whatever I wear.
But why is this not good?
Because you're cool it's just so-so.
If that chick Sung Min Ah falls for you then what?
Then it can't be helped.
Oppa is many people's man.
And Oppa belongs to Bit Na. Don't you know that?
We're just shooting a drama poster.
From now until the drama ends... that bitch Sung Min Ah will be stuck to you throughout!
Then would you rather have me wear outfits like a beggar while I film the drama?
Then promise. That you won't look at that chick first.
Instead of a promise I'll give you an oath.
That's enough, right? Sung Min Ah is known for her punctuality, but even if I step on hard, I think we will still be late about 20 minutes.
Why are you stepping on?
Go slowly.
If the main actor Kang Hyun Min is late, even if it's not 20 minutes but one hour they have to wait.
We should tame her.
Run slowly, Kwang Soo!
As for the poster's theme this time, what about this?
In this mood... - No, I prefer this one.
Will that be ok?
What? Sung Min Ah keeps her appointments as sharply as a knife?
So, didn't I tell you to run slowly or what?
Kwang Soo?
I tried to come as slowly as possible, but...
Sung Min Ah arrived!
Hello, Director.
Oh, CP, hello! - Wow, you look fantastic!
Sorry I'm a bit late.
No, it's okay. Do the make-up and the shooting will start right away.
- See you at the shooting studio.
Min Ah.
Seems like you're not good at keeping appointments.
Sorry. Then...
Dejecting her with simple and impact words.
She's totally dejected.
Yes, President.
Now almost all actors have been decided, only the date that we start shooting is left.
So this is no lesser than Anthony.
It is preposterous, but there is one thing I have to tell you...
Let's hear it. We may be a bit later that the shooting date that is specified in the contract details, is that going to be alright?
Seeing how meticulously you have done the preparations, that is possible.
Don't pay too much attention to it.
See you at the production report conference.
Oh, good!
Wow, whatever the camera takes is totally like a masterpiece!
It's killing!
Hey, this... this one...
Good! Oh, Min Ah, it was a good shot!
Do it properly.
Act...ion!
Wow, this one is great, isn't it, Sunbaenim?
Wow, whatever the camera takes is the piece, piece!
You worked hard, Director.
Well done, well done.
What did I do today?
This is a piece of cake compared to the upcoming brutal schedule.
But... you asked for a script change?
I heard it from the broadcaster.
I thought it would be better if a few points were amended.
I wish the change to be completed before the script reading session, but Writer Lee seemed to have a lot of thoughts in her mind.
Please talk to her well.
Then... Ah, yes, yes.
Aish, Writer Lee, this...
If she's asked for a script change, she should revise it! She's not yielding again! Sunbaenim,
I think you should step in here. What do you mean "step in"?
Well, Writer Lee, that kiddo, she's quite daring, sometimes. -Last time, when Director Moon...
She's not daring, but persevering.
Without that much backbone, how can she write scripts?
No, that... that... Ah, really... Sunbaenim!
Kwang Soo.
Who on earth hired that photographer?
Why? Like a die-for fan of Sung Min Ah, he kept saying Min Ah, Min Ah...
Min Ah...
It was so annoying I though I was going to die! Hyung, hyung, hyung!
As you were not at the make-up room, I thought you left.
Yes. Anyway, since we're going to spend a lot of time together from now on, let's get along well.
I'm sorry. My hands are a bit dirty...
Then... What was that?
Is she...?
Is she really refusing the handshake of this superstar, Kang Hyun Min?
Aren't you disregarding him a bit too much?
He's just a puppyish brat who thinks he's an actor.
He's not even worth conversing with.
Yes, Chief Producer.
Are you in your right mind?
What do you... mean?
Sung Min Ah of all people is asking for a script revision.
Why can't you yield?
! No need to talk more. As per Sung Min Ah's request, change the script.
It doesn't suit you.
In a building that doesn't suit you at all and the shabby office...
Did you come to confirm that?
That writer...
Exactly, the same as you see.
She just has her temper, not compromising.
Can you fire that writer?
I'm asking if you can fire her for me.
I just wanted to know your thoughts.
Before that let me ask something as well.
What are you going to do if Lee Go Eun won't change her script to the end?
The things I want, I get all of them, as you know. Of course,
I couldn't have only one person, though.
In the future it will be difficult as well.
That you don't feel or want such a thing like love.
But I don't care.
Because I will make you love me.
After all, that was what I thought.
You were trying to shake the scripts as you want by a scheme with Sung Min Ah.
There was no such intention at all.
But it's clear that it was predetermined.
It was predetermined?
Sung Min Ah is an actress in the position who can choose not only her co-star but also the writer.
This is the inevitable process we should endure from the moment Sung Min Ah was cast.
You promised me that you wouldn't touch the script.
I definitely did.
But now you're telling me to change it, even by using the actress, managers of the broadcasting station!
I have not told you to fix the script even once.
Fighting with a director, struggling with a producer, being interfered by the broadcasting station, and having a power game with actors consistently are a drama writer's fate!
That's why I was once fired by the pressure from the broadcasting station, and fought with you all the time, Representative.
Now I'm fighting with the actress.
Right now, you know I would obviously lose, so you're telling me there is no need to fight.
Fight openly on the square against her!
You said you wanted to protect your script.
So fight. Fight and win!
But in return, you're fighting alone.
No one at all will help you.
So... being a writer is an infinitely lonely job.
Oh, right now?
Yes. Understood.
It was CP Lee Sung Gyu that just called.
He wants you to come to the station right now.
He wants to talk with you about the production budget.
Face the challenge and fight on!
You said you want to protect your script, right?
Then, fight. Fight and win.
However, you'll be fighting on your own.
Not a single soul will help you.
Joo PD.
I have a favor to ask of you.
That does not make sense.
It's a period piece with Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah as the leads.
Well, that.. that is true.
Of course, I know that.
Total production cost is 9.8 billion.
The 300 million per episode makes 6 billion.
Projected international sales is 1.7 billion.
Cable network sales is 10 billion.
That's only 8.7 billion in total.
You want me to take a deficit of 1.1 billion won?
No... You want me to take a deficit of 1.1 billion won? No...
That's not what I mean...
No...
That's right!
Product placements! You can get money that way!
The historical setting is during Japanese colonization. Product placements are not viable!
That...
I'll talk with the Director in person.
Why do you have to give us so much trouble?
Just go easy on us.
And besides, the Director is not in his office at the moment.
Hey, hey, hey, wait.
It's my treat.
Are you putting it on the corporate card as the Director?
Hey, I don't use the corporate card on my personal business.
Installments for 3 months, please.
Hey, what is Wan Soo doing?
Unemployed.
Representative Kim, what brings you here?
I came to see you, Director.
I guess I need to talk with him.
Alright, I will see you later.
I'll call you
What is it? Is it urgent?
It's about the production cost of "Morning of Kyeongseong."
If it's about the production cost, it's no use for you to come here, Representative Kim.
It's been already decided, as you know.
I don't understand why you're giving us an amount similar to small dramas like "Children of Paradise."
Do you think that drama will guarantee as much commercial advertisement profit as my drama?
But that is why that drama is important to us as well.
Because nobody invests money in it.
Nobody expects it to make any money.
If you know that it's not going to make any money, why do it?
Because the world today desperately needs that drama. Understood?
Are you saying that "Morning of Kyeonseong" is not a drama the world needs?
No, "Morning of Kyeongseong" has its own value, too, that the world can benefit from.
Plus, it's got commercial potential as well.
It's a great drama.
However, even dramas that nobody thinks will make money need to be produced, is what I think.
Not for profits, but for its benefits to the society.
Do you enjoy playing holier-than-thou like that? Sure, I suppose someone like you wouldn't know the joy in it.
It seems that the massage place is the most likely place at that hour.
May I see your member ID?
Miss Sung Min Ah is inside, right?
I'm here to see Miss Sung Min Ah.
Lee Go Eun, she said you know her.
Tell her exactly what I say.
She said that unless you brought the changed script, she won't see you, so you should leave.
Ah, hey!
- I'm sorry. - Please, stop!
- You can't do this!
It's an emergency.
Listen, stop...!
Get out of here, now!
You're quite an interesting person.
I'm more interesting once you get to know me better.
Can you give us some privacy?
Now, entertain me.
I'm not making dramas as a charity.
Aigoo, fancy meeting you here!
Director Nam Woon Young!
Though I'm rather late, congratulations on your promotion to Director.
I suppose you are late. Thanks anyway.
I see, you hate me.
You're at the top of the food chain in the drama world.
Well then, excuse me...
Let me give you a warning.
Leave this field while I'm still being civil.
You're the one whose time has come to retire, Chairman.
I decide my own destiny.
I can also decide your destiny.
And what are you going to decide?
Just wait.
You'll find out soon enough.
That's why you can't accept it.
You know the risks involved with that decision.
Why insist?
Why are you risking your job for this? The legendary British actor Alec Guinness once said, "There's no such thing as a small part.
You're trying to school me?
It would be bad for you yourself, too.
Also... there will be no revision of scripts.
So you can drink soju too.
What's the result of the fight?
I heard from PD Joo that you went to see Sung Min Ah.
There will be no revisions on scripts.
And Sung Min Ah will attend neither the script reading session nor the production report conference tomorrow.
Yes, she will attend.
Why do you think so?
Because Sung Min Ah is a professional.
Professionals have infinite sense of responsibility about their work.
A profession with sense of responsibility is doing this for her own interest only?
Both a professional and an amateur, they all make a mistake.
Then, an amateur blames the world, but a professional takes time in reflecting on herself/himself.
Take time...?
Time which an amateur like you wouldn't dare to think about.
I mean, episode 1, don't you think it shows it's theme excessively?
Finally, the first day of the official schedule for the drama "Morning of Kyeongseong" is starting.
At 2 PM, meeting all actors and reading the scripts. At 5 PM, moving to the auditorium and having the production report conference.
From now on, everyone, remember exactly what you have to do and proceed without fail.
Yes, I understand!
Goo Hee Jae, set up the room for reading scripts by 2 PM.
Manager Park, check the actors as per their schedule and make calls to confirm.
Ah, yes, so you're on your way here?
PD Joo, go to the auditorium directly, and check all the details for the last time.
The main poster on the background must be placed with extreme care.
Yes, Reporter Park!
Manager Han, call all reporters of media companies and portal sites, and get their anticipated questions in advance.
Now, I think you should go to the reading room.
Ah, and Watanabe Group contacted me, and told me that Chairman won't be able to come.
When would he arrive?
It will be at 2:35PM.
But.. do you have to pick him up personally, Chairman?
To the airport, I can go...
The leader of Watanabe Group which assets are worth of 60 billion yen (about US$730 million) is coming, so I should show some courtesy to him at least.
What is with that face?
I made a revision on the script.
These are the revised version of episode 1 and 2 of "Morning of Kyeongseong".
Revision?
Yesterday, I went back home and took time to read them again.
I could see that.
The excessiveness of theme.
So, do these scripts not have excessive theme any longer?
I will show the completion of theme at the last episode.
You sound pretty confident.
If I weren't confident, I wouldn't have even started it.
How is it?
This rookie is pretty good.
Her writing skill is quite workable.
Ah... this is not good.
Does it make sense?
Does she have any brain or not?
Hyun Min, even so, shouldn't you read the revised script before the reading session? Hyung, in a car, why would I read it, hurting my eyes?
I can read it when I get there.
Can't you know by just smelling it?
That this is quite something?
You should print out the new scripts!
Yes. By the way, you're not even on episode 1, but you came quite early.
You could've come 1 hour late.
Aish, with my temper, I just should've...
Go inside first. You were so confident, but I guess you were scared after all.
Yes, I was scared.
I was scared if I would lose the composure of my life.
Thank you all for coming here for "Morning of Kyeongseong".
Now, let's start the reading session for episode 1 and episode 2.
Well, episode 1 of "Morning of Kyeongseong".
Scene 1, panorama of Kyeongseong city, lively Kyeongseong city is shown.
On the road, a streetcar is passing, and many pedestrians between rickshaws.
Then a cut-in, "November 7th, 1938".
A peddler, looking around for a moment, pulls out something from the inside pocket and gives it to Woo Jin. Woo Jin, getting close his face to that peddler.
There must be one more.
The peddler, opening the towels which covered the face, is the main female role, Jin Hye Rin.
The other one will arrive tonight.
It will come out at midnight, through the check register machine.
Woo Jin, after taking a moment to think something, whispers.
Woo Jin, after taking a moment to think something, whispers. Mr. Kang Hyun Min, it's your turn to read.
When I said I wouldn't swim in the sea, you didn't even sniff, but now without my permission, you were totally seduced by that fox and changed all scripts.
And now what?
What's wrong with me?
I can't do with these scripts. No,
Director, I'm sorry.
With this feeling, I can't do this, either.
So, it's finally started.
Everytime, whenever the drama starts, this happens, the war of nerves among animals.
Pardon?
PD Joo, do you know where we are?
This is a jungle made of asphalt.
What are you doing now?
Are you asking that because you don't know?
Lower your voice.
Don't you see those reporters?
Smile. And relax your hardened face first.
If we're not going to use the original scripts, I won't be able to smile comfortably.
Until when will you whine all the time, without thinking straight?
Do you think I'm now whining?
Ah, here is colder than Fukuoka.
The president of the best broadcasting station in Korea came himself to welcome us.
Since you're coming, of course, I should come welcome you, Chairman.
This is the president of SBC.
And this is the son of Watanabe, the heir of Watanabe Group, Mr. Watanabe Kenji.
Ah, I see. Nice to meet you.
My name is Jeong Ji Hyun.
Nice to meet you. (in Korean)
I'm Watanabe Kenji.
You're speaking Korean very well.
Because I have business in Korea too.
Please keep making investments for our future Korean dramas too.
Yes, this way.
So what do you want me to do?
Are you saying I should go back in?
The production announcement is soon.
Should I go out there alone?
Kang Hyun Min is going to come.
I trust our Rep will bring him back.
So, please, come back in.
Writer Lee Go Eun, I thought I warned you already.
Don't act up.
That's not it
This is a favor.
I didn't say I wouldn't play for this drama.
I said I can't do it with that revised script.
Why don't you go back when I say nicely?
Will you punch me otherwise?
Are you saying you will kill both of us?
Whether dying now or dying slowly after public humilation, it's all same to me.
Don't lie to me.
Do you think I will fall for that bluff?
I don't care if you believe it or not. I have nothing to fear any longer. Choose whether we die together, or live together.
Soon, the production report conference for Drama "Morning of Kyeongseong" will be started.
Please turn off your cell phones for a moment.
Have a good time, ma'am.
Thanks to Go Eun, I'm having a chance to see this kind of show.
By the way, why is she wearing black sunglasses indoors?
With that, can you see properly?
Is this young wench deaf?
I guess she's totally fine.
Kang Hyun Min stormed out during the reading session.
Kang Hyun Min?
Kang Hyun Min?
Why...? Did he run away?
-Yes.
Why?
He said he wouldn't play for the revised script.
You punk...!
You should've held even his pants to stop him!
Right now, the press conference is getting ready to begin.
What about Sung Min Ah?
She also said she would leave, but Writer Lee is holding on to her.
Where is the MC....?
Now, the production report conference for "Morning of Kyeongseong" will be started.
Hello, everyone. I'm your host, Lee Il Hwan.
This is driving me crazy
Okay, then let me introduce to you the two stars appearing in "Morning of Kyeongseong," Kang Hyun Min, Sung Min Ah, and also Director Goo.
Let's bring them in.
Hey, what are you doing?
Quickly go and find out what's going on.
What a comedy this is... Well, I guess they are having a moment to give us more dramatic effect. Please wait for a moment.
Well, the male lead actor, the female lead actress and Director, would you please come out?
I'm going crazy..... Because of the script reading session which was planned before this conference, I'm afraid the schedule has been a little bit delayed.
Please wait a moment longer
They say that Kang Hyun Min might not attend this conference because of some urgent issue.
I'm afraid I will have to leave first.
We'd better get going, too.
Kang Hyun Min's not arrived yet?
What else is there to do?
We need to go in there at least.
Well, let's go in.
Going in without the protagonist?
I'm sorry, Director. I came a bit late.
As much time as you took, you just make the food tasty..
What about the Representative?
Well, the situation in there didn't seem good. But are you okay to be here, doing nothing?
What brought you here?
Well, this isn't a place I can't come, you know.
Oh, introduce yourself to him. This is Kenji, the new CEO of Watanabe Group.
I'm Kenji, the son of Watanabe Hiroshi.
Then... the Chairman is...
And as the new Chairman of Watanabe Group, I'm telling you, that all investment to World Production and Anthony Kim will be withdrawn as of now.
And 3.4 billion won previously given for the partial investment must be returned within this month.
Episode 9 Battle of Red Cliffs It seems the situation in there wasn't good. But is it okay for you to be here, doing nothing?
What brought you here? Well, this isn't a place I can't come, as you know. Oh, introduce yourself to him.
This is Kenji, the new CEO of Watanabe Group. I'm Kenji, the son of Watanabe Hiroshi. Then... the Chairman is...
His illness has gotten more serious, so he gave all management rights to me.
And as the new CEO of Watanabe Group, I'm telling you... that all investments to World Production and Anthony Kim... will be withdrawn as of now.
And the 3.4 billion won previously given for the partial investment... must be returned within this month.
If all the management rights were passed on to you, so would have the investment contracts as well.
How can you ask for the 3.4 billion back?
I believe that the starting date for shooting is today on the contract.
I am making a reasonable request based on a breach of the contract.
However, Chairman Watanabe and I had a verbal agreement on it!
A business man makes promises by signing and proves with documents.
And also, Anthony, let me tell you again...
I am the chairman now.
I'll excuse myself.
Didn't I tell you before?
That I determine your fate as well. No matter how much you wish for it,
I'm not going down this easily.
Well, it's not going to be easy.
Stay strong...
Sunbaenim.
You two, I don't want any more tension like this after today.
Such tension needs to be while you're on camera, not out of it.
Okay, let's go in.
What going on?
-Just stay still.
They are here now.
Yes, everyone, you waited long enough.
The "Morning in Kyeongseong" actors, Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah.
Well then, please give a big round of applause.. ..for the two lead actors and the director of 'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Just now, what were they talking about?
Withdrawing the investment..?
Is it true that we have to return all the investment money we received?
What did they say? Say something.
Well then, we'll begin the photo time for the two actors.
I request the actors to please use the center of the stage.
Ah, really, they look so beautiful like a newlywed couple.
Please use the center of the stage.
I did tell you but the main lead of this drama is me.
I don't think you're acting skill can handle that.
That's what I should be saying.
Please look at the front.
What is the reason you are rescinding the finances?
I don't have any interest in your drama.
What I am interested in.. ..is whether you can pay me back the 3.4 billion.
In case you can't... are you willing to give up your hand as a promise? I can promise. But before that,
I need to confirm if Mr. Watanabe also thinks the same. Then give it a try.
Right now, Father is in Korea.
He is seriously ill.
He wanted to be in Korea during his final days.
He has passed away.
The Chairman... has left you a letter before passing away.
Mr. Anthony, I'm sorry.
It seems that I am finally paying for all the wrongs I have committed during my life.
I can sense that I'll be in hell soon.
I wanted to watch your drama please forgive me who left without keeping his promise.
Even if Chairman wasn't able to keep his promise
I will keep that promise.
Even in hell, you will get to see 'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Watanabe is dead.
That's too bad. Now that the investment is cancelled for sure, there is nothing Anthony can do.
Anthony will be running around, looking for money.
We have to stop him from getting any investments.
However, it is going to be difficult to gather such a big amount in so little time.
Is it really worth it to go to that length because of Anthony?
Anthony, that bastard, is someone who wants to tear me down. Until I see his last breath fade away with my own eyes, this war is not over!
When he said he couldn't come to the showcase, I had no idea it was because he was ill.
Who would've ever thought he'd pass away like that.. Anyway, it's a big hit if we have to return the investment.
Out of the 3.4 billion, we've used most of it and have only 100 million left. In other words, before this month is over, we have to find 3.3 billion?
Can't we find another investor in time?
Given this economy, it will be tough to find a willing investor.
Besides, the amount is too huge.
Even if we were to take a loan, we have nothing for collateral. Even if we miraculously got that much money, we have to start shooting next week....
Then what are we going to do?
Are we going to end like this?
How can we give up like that after coming all the way here.
Be strong people. We never know, some kind of miracle might happen.
We need a miracle.
However, miracle is not something you wait for but something you make. From now on, Without wasting one breath and without looking back, we're going to run only looking ahead.
Commence our meeting.
In reality, getting an investment in a short period of time is not easy.
But we can try to get a loan from banks putting our drama as a collateral.
How much money is left in our account?
We have about 120 million won. (US$120,000)
Good, with that money, make sure the first shooting is to be prepared without any trouble.
But to return the fund on time, it would be better not to use that money...
Does everyone understand?
Does everyone understand?
Good. Team Leader Park, arrange meetings with our main banks.
And let's contact other financial companies, one by one, too.
If we can get from three companies, the amount of each loan can be reduced, so the possibility (to get the loan) would be greater.
PD Joo, Manager Han and Hee Jae, you guys divide the works and prepare the shooting perfectly.
Yes. Well then, from now on, run to the end of the horizon as fast as we can and escape from this desert!
Do you want to be in a situation later with only sending a one page script?
What are you doing not getting on with your writing?
Yes, Representative.
I've made a list of minor financial companies which we might be able to get some loans.
Those are located within Seoul or near Seoul.
These three seem mostly workable.
Call them and schedule an appointment.
Joo PD, come here and look at this.
Take a look at this.
It's 14,293,000 won.
It's way over the budget.
Please put this back.
Anthony has a lot of money.
What about this?
Camera 1 will be placed over there in a long shot.
Camera 2 on the boat, and Camera 3 will film Kang Hyun Min jumping in the water in a full shot.
Yes, I think that would be good.
Yes. Your air-date is also fixed, and the lead actor and actress are top stars.
As long as you meet our conditions, I don't think it would be difficult.
Then we will prepare all the necessary documents today and come back tomorrow.
If you could please wait for a while.
Yes, Head Director.
Well this..
I don't know how to tell you.
I'm afraid that for this case, we won't be able to give you the loan.
Why are you saying this suddenly?
This is because of our internal problem.
What is that internal problem?
Please don't ask me about the reason why.
I'm sorry, but it would be difficult.
This drama has Sung Min Ah and Kang Hyun Min as main actors.
Its air date is also set now.
It's because our branch's situation isn't great now.
I'm sorry, but it will be hard for us.
I'm sorry, but it will be difficult for us.
Please look over it one more time.
The higher-ups aren't comfortable.
Please understand our situation too.
Well, I think I'm always asking you a difficult favor every time, President (of a bank).
Right, why don't we go for a rounding (golf) some time soon?
What is the reason that you suddenly say it won't work?
We got it ordered from the boss, so we can't do anything about it.
The boss? I'm really sorry.
Yes, PD Joo.
Representative, We have a problem.
The ship that we rented wasn't arriving, so I checked it up.
They are saying that they can't send us the ship if we don't pay twice of what we made the contract.
Twice?
If that happens, it will be way over our fund that we planned.
As you know, the money is a little...
Hey Crazy Dog!
We at least need a ship to put the computer graphic on or whatever.
Are you doing this because you don't want to spend the money?
I'm really sorry Director.
Part of our investment was cut off.
The investment?
Yes, however it will be resolved soon.
Please trust me.
Sung Min Ah. Seong Min Ah.
Seong Min Ah.
Seong Min Ah. Seong Min Ah.
Still Seong Min Ah!
Does this make's sense
She said she would write it for me!
Hey, what's the score until now?
37 to 38.
Seong Min Ah is leading by a lot.
Jesus Christ
Seong Min Ah, that fox-like woman stole away all my scenes!
Hyung, with this time, you better memorize an extra line of the new script...
What did you say, you punk?
Do you think I could concentrate on the script now?
Kwang Soo!
But still, why hasn't the shooting started yet?
I need to go and check.
Why is the shooting taking so long to start?
Min Ah, we have a problem.
The investment from Japan is cut off.
What is going on?
They said there was a problem with the investor.
It seems we have some problems but they will be solved soon.
You know how Anthony, despite being a dog, is good at handling these things Well, don't get too depressed, let's call it a day.
The broadcasting network needs to know that Anthony has lost the investment.
That way, his last desperate efforts will get even more gruesome.
So, how are things going then?
We're currently looking into new investors so please don't worry about it. The broadcasting license fee of 300 million per episode, we'll pay the first episode's in advance.
Thank you, Head Director.
However, this is how far I can be of help.
You have to take care of the finances as soon as possible.
If anything goes wrong, the board of directors will have an uproar.
An uproar?
They'll want to sue you for failing to fill the broadcasting slot.
[Sung Min Ah]
I heard that you are having some difficulties
I'll solve it.
Don't worry too much.
Let's talk later.
Oppa.
Do you remember what we talked about some time before?
The thing we talked about during Christmas at my place?
Let's meet now.
Prepare well for the shooting.
That's how you can help me at the moment.
-Oppa
Later, after a long time.
Once I become a famous top star, if I become someone who can help you, someone who's strong and powerful...
Once you become one?
When that time comes, will you accept my help?
We'll do that I guess.
But something like that won't happen.
There's a lot that you still don't know about me.
Like what type of person I am.
Unnie.
Contact Representative Oh and tell him I have to see him.
Min Ah. You- Right now.
PD Joo, get the car ready.
We're going to Myeongdong.
No. You can't, Representative.
No, I know we're desperate, but to take a private loan...
The annual interest rate is 200%!
This is practically kicking the bucket yourself!
Even if our drama were to succeed.. no, even before that, we'll all die!
I agree with them, Representative.
Last time you did that, the company went bankrupt, you even lost your house!
The only hope we have left is Chairman Jang of Myeongdong.
Representative, I am done revising episodes 3 and 4...
What's wrong with him? All our loan applications were rejected, so now he's going to get a private loan.
Private loan?
Yes. Then. After all you've been through, you haven't had enough and are still doing dramas?
It's a drama with a set broadcasting schedule and top stars as leading actors.
The documents included are a copy of the broadcasting slot certificate and an amotization schedule.
Even still, you've come to me because you didn't get any investment.
I need three or four big ones.
You need 3.4 Billion?
And the collateral?
My hand that will lead this drama to success is the collateral.
Please help.
Anthony. Your hand... No, your body,
Bring me a real collateral.
Chairman... Secretary Choi, take him away!
Chairman, I beg you!
I can even sell all my internal organs!
If I could give you all my scalp, I'd gladly skin my head.
I could serve you as a slave the rest of my life, Chairman!
Please, I beg you.
Just this once!
Chairman! After losing everything, coming to me again and begging like that, you're the first. I don't know how much this drama means to you, just give up!
You know what's crueler than money?
Human ambition. If you don't want to ruin your life, start by throwing that away.
Chairman, please help me!
Don't kick me out like this! Please, Chairman!
Chairman!
Please help me, Chairman!
Chairman, don't kick me out!
I beg you, Chairman!
I don't know how much this drama means to you, just give up!
Human ambition.
If you don't want to ruin your life. Start by throwing that away.
Who hasn't turned in the school support fee yet?
You must turn them in by tomorrow!
If you can bring the fee by tomorrow, you may go back to your seat.
What's with you?
You aren't going to bring it tomorrow?
You'll be hit until you answer me that you'll bring it.
You won't even if I do this?
You think you're so tough?
You're hungry, right?
Come and eat.
I ate already.
Why do we live so poor?
Did something happen at school?
Tell me, why are we so poor?
I'm not going to live like you Mom.
I'm going to earn money like crazy, and eat meat until my stomach bursts.
I'll become a big shot that rides his own car!
I'm going to make money even if I die!
Even if I die!
I'm impressed that you've lasted for 3 years in this shabby office. That you'd go to such lengths to make sure I'm ruined,
I had no idea, Chairman. You didn't even hesitate staining your own noble hands, why are you so intent on crushing me?
That's because I know the mettle of your being more than anybody else.
You resemble me a lot.
What exactly is it that you want?
Leave 'Morning in Kyeongseong' to me.
I'll give you .5 billion in return.
I'll also throw in the repayment of the 3.4 billion of Watanabe investment.
I think that's enough compensation for all the work you've put into it so far.
Why are you willing to go so far in order to get 'Morning in Kyeongseong'?
You think my goal is to produce just one petty little drama like that?
I want something much bigger.
Although I guess the one who sowed the seed of my big ambition doesn't remember.
Give it a good thought. Whether to waste your life in jail with a huge debt crushing your shoulders, or to live an ordinary life with half a billion won.
Are you going to the chairman of Empire?
Go take that money.
I'll also drop 'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Isn't it alright as long as we can start working on the next project?
We've made it thus far, we can try again.
It should be alright if I write another great piece.
Who is it?
I'm here to meet the Chairman.
Have you come to a decision?
'Morning in Kyeongseong'... ..I cannot leave it in your hands.
You should know the best that you only have one week to return the investment.
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
However, I'd rather die than hand over that project to you.
You're going for a heroic suicide?
I'll leave it up to the gods.
Do you think I will lose?
Don't you know that for a writer, good health is money and time is money?
What's going to happen with the script if you get a cold?
Why are you outside?
I decided to fight.
Is it possible for us to win?
What is it at this late hour?
Was it your doing, Representative?
The cancellation of the investment of "Morning in Kyeongseong." Min Ah, I know about your feelings for Anthony, but that Anthony is totally ruined now.
Just forget about him.
Why do you hate him so much?
I'll tell you this at least.
This time, it was the Chairman himself who did it.
We've saved up some of our wages you'd paid us so far.
We know it's nowhere near the repayment amount, but... Writer Lee made the most contribution, by the way.
The 20 million you gave me for the script and some of my personal savings.
It's quite a bit. Use it for "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Representative, be strong!
Please be strong!
Like that would make him strong!
The director's fee you gave me.
You can pay the interest with the next drama.
Director and everybody, listen to me carefully.
Do you think I'll be grateful with this?
Please, just make sure you can look after your own selves first.
Did I hear that right?
A person cannot change that easily after all.
So, if you could lend the company about half..
Then, 1 billion?
So, are you asking me to pull out 1 billion?
Well, it doesn't exactly have to be 1 billion, but whatever you could chip in...
Why should I part with my own blood money? !
Our drama is at a crisis right now. We just need to overcome this moment of hardship, so everybody should join our efforts.
The Representative is running around looking for funding by himself.
He may not show it, but he's going through hell right now.
But then, why are you here to talk about this?
By any chance, do you like Anthony?
No, I mean, it's Anthony who's suffering with no money.
Why are you here looking for money.
Isn't that strange?
My drama is about to be wrecked, is that so strange?
Besides, if we don't secure enough funds, we may never get to see "Morning in Kyeongseong" ever!
Honestly, "Morning in Kyeongseong" started with you, Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
I'm aware that 1 billion is not an amount that one can easily lent.
However, you, Mr. Kang Hyun Min, are like a landmark of this drama.
As the protagonist of the drama, if you have any affection towards "Morning in Kyeongseong"...
Why is he like that?
Did he really start reading a book and fell asleep?
He's been like that for a while.
About lending Anthony 1 billion.
Hyung, are you telling me you've been thinking about that till now.
Are you really thinking of lending the money?
I'm the landmarking of this work, so I should atleast think about these things.
Landmarking?
It's landmark.
Hyung, call Anthony.
Tell him that I'll help him. That 1 billion won, I'm depositing it soon.
1 billion?
I'm also going to try living a little differently.
Looked like they didn't have much time, so call him now.
That I'm sending it soon.
I'm really calling.
Yes, Representative Choi.
Representative Kim?
Listen, our Hyun Min has made a big decision for "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Hyun Min made a big decision of what?
I can't do this, Hyung, this money means so much to me!
You would never help anybody with 1 billion!
Hey, darn that bastard!
Hello Representative Kim? Yes, Representative Choi, tell Hyun Min, that he should make a big decision about getting ready to swim in the ocean.
The call wasn't to lend money but to ask about the swimming in the sea scene?
I know you're busy but come out for a while.
The same cafe where we used to go often.
I'll wait until you get here.
I'm going to run an errand, prepare a list of potential investors outside of the capital.
Hyung, are you crazy?
You told me to call him!
Usually, you do things at the speed of a snail.
Why were you so fast this time?
You told me to hurry!
Will you die if I tell you to die?
That was 1 billion won of money!
Are you doing whatever you want because it is not your money?
Do you know it's been 5 years?
To be back here where you broke up with me so heartlessly.
That was 5 years ago.
I'm sorry but I'm a little busy.
Can we just talk about business?
What will happen If I abandon you now?
I'm asking what will happen if I leave this project.
Did you call me to tell me you're done?
No. So that I won't leave this project, accept this money.
All I've got that is available right now is just half a billion.
For interest, I would like to receive your heart.
I guess it would still be difficult.
Your dream, I hope you can make it come true. Turn around World Production into a world class production company like 20th Century Fox.
World class 20th Century Fox...?
Your dream when you worked at Empire 5 years ago.
Here, this is the place.
We're going to build the largest filming studio in Asia.
[5 years ago]
All the fans of Korean dramas from Japan, China, other Asian countries, plus more fans from over 60 different countries will be drawn by it.
The catch is, we need a masterpiece that can do it.
Could you take charge and do it?
If you'd put me in charge, I'm going to turn this Empire into the 20th Century Fox of dramas!
So it was that.
I'll use the money well.
You're a real big help.
Thank you. Once part of the studio is finished, let's use it for filming "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Then, the land that was worth 5k won per 35 sq ft will increase its value by 5000% in no time!
Purchase this land no matter the cost!
So, you came here because you're interested in my land?
I'm interested in the whole lot of 143k sq ft that you have.
For over 10 years, nobody has ever shown interest in it.
You must have quite a fortune for someone so young.
But I won't be buying it.
In a few days, somebody else will come, wanting to buy your land.
He will want to speed up the deal, offering a slightly higher price than the market.
However, you should never agree to a contract.
Get lost.
Who do you think you're trying to fool?
I've seen tons of scammers like you in my life!
I'm sure you have seen many scammers like me.
However, you never know.
So what? If you would believe me, you can make billions without even lifting a finger from where you are sitting.
Get lost!
We can't afford to simply wait anymore.
We need to switch to a different production company as soon as possible.
Thinks very carefully.
If we don't do well, we will be removed from our places.
Is it possible for us to win?
Like you said, somebody came to see me.
He offered more than the market price, wanting to buy the whole 143k sq ft.
So what did you do?
For now, I sent them back.
So now, tell me what you want.
What I want is half of the profit you will make.
Invest that money in me.
That is my condition.
(Investment? )
WIll you believe me, and go along with my plan? I've even offered to double the market price, yet the land owner is being stubborn.
He's stubborn?
He says he has no thought of selling the land.
This won't do.
I'll have to meet him in person.
Seemed like he is greatly attached to the land his father passed on to him.
It was quite a challenge to even get him to come here, with his age and all.
Land passed onto him by his father, huh?
That seems to be why he doesn't want to sell at all.
The old live in the past and are buried in the past.
Even so, the old have a future, too.
The future of the old...?
It's their children.
The future of the old is the seeds they have sown, their children.
Like that, even as the old die away, they live the future through their seeds.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
There's nothing to think so hard about.
In short, the answer is money.
The inheritance of the past that can guarantee a bright future for the children.
Please take a seat.
I don't think that's needed.
Just go ahead and talk.
What is the reason that you wanted to see me?
Then, I am sure that he will get to the point right away.
I will pay the triple.
Don't accept that either. The fact that I have absolutely no thought of selling my land, I thought you were well aware of that.
Well, then.
Five times...
I'll give you five times as much.
We prepared the contract.
With the condition that we will pay all the amount until noon by tomorrow.
I just came back home after completing the contract.
Everything happened as you predicted.
I will be receiving the money at the noon tomorrow.
I will meet you with the investment contract tomorrow.
Kyeongsung'sMorning:
InvestmentContract
President Kenji wants to see you.
Please let him know that I will see him within today.
President ordered us to bring you.
I am on my way to get the money to return to President.
I'm sorry but can you move aside.
Say that in front of the Chairman.
We only carry out his orders.
Hey, get him!
Chase him!
Can't you think about it one more time?
Not just one but I thought about this 10 times.
Put yourself in my shoe. If you had 10 billion, Put yourself in my shoe.
If you had 10 billion, could you give it away easily?
I'm not asking you to give it but lend it.
I've also Had a really hard time getting till here.
Honestly, even if I give away 10 billions ($1 million), it will not be resolved.
It's just like pumping water into a broken crock.
How do you know if the crock is broken or not?
Then call Anthony right now and confirm it.
If Anthony could find a single penny, I'll change my mind then.
Lee Go Eun, Listen carefully to what I say from now on.
If you walk into an alley back of our company building, there will be an iron gate at the dead end.
What is that about?
I don't have time to explain in detail.
Behind that gate, there is my bag.
A bag with the contract, which we need in order to get the investment.
If you can't contact me afterwards, that means something happened to me.
Then you will have to find the investor with that bag.
You understand what I'm saying right?
But what's wrong?
Shouldn't we contact the police?
No, it will be too late by then.
Just do what I tell you.
Before noon today, you must go and see the investor. Then he will take care of the rest.
Rep...
Come with me right now.
Contractofbuyingand sellingland . About the land, I have sent the money.
But do you think Anthony will easily give up on the piece easily?
It has nothing to do with Anthony's will now. Once tonight is over,
'Morning in Kyeongseong' ... ..is ours.
Have you come back to your senses?
What are you thinking of doing capturing me?
If you let me go right now, I can bring you back the money right away.
How do I believe in those words?
Do you have an official document that you could prove it?
If you don't believe in me, It's okay if you come together with me.
Rather than that, easily... getting the money back...
I believe there is a certain way to do it.
"Morning of Kyeongsang"...
Leave it to the Empire.
At the end, is it this? With the same purpose as Empire, are you going to threaten me so that you can give my work away to Empire?
All I need is getting my money.
That's why please make your decision.
It's whether by giving them "Kyeongsung's Morning," paying me back, or... give me your hand as you promised.

Episode 10 FatedLovers Stop! Stop right there!
What is this about? I don't have time to explain in detail. Just do what I tell you.
Before noon today, you must go and see the investor. Then they'll take care of the rest. Hello?
Representative!
"Morning in Kyeongseong"...
leave it to Empire.
At the end, is it this? With the same purpose as Empire, are you going to threaten me so that you can give my work away to Empire?
All I need is getting my money.
That's why please make your decision. It's whether by giving them "Morning in Kyeongseong," paying me back, or giving me your hand as you promised.
The promised deadline is tonight at midnight.
As long as you get the money by then, isn't it good?
Someone will come bring me the money by 12?
If only you decide to wait until then.
Well, since a promise is a promise. I guess I'll wait.
Until 12, you have around 3 hours and 10 minutes. Before that, someone needs to do it for sure.
So where is this gate and this bag?
Is it even true that if we find the bag, the money can be returned?
Just shush and focus on looking!
But I'm looking for it though.
It's just that I don't see it!
Gate, gate... Excuse me, aren't you Hyun Min oppa?
You think I'm not?
Nice to meet you!
- In 12th grade!
You should be studying then!
Guys, is there a gated dead end nearby? There is one if you enter this way.
Over here Hyun Min oppa.
Oh, here?
Didn't you say we were fine just finding the bag?
We don't have any time.
The Representative said that we have to get this taken care of before midnight no matter what.
Finally your end is here.
Is this the right place?
I'm sorry for intruding this late.
I'm sorry for intruding this late. This is Mr. Choi Pil Seong's house right?
Yes it is, but he's not here at the moment.
He went to meet his friends.
He said he would be drinking. He might be a little late.
Where is that place?
We need to see him as soon as possible.
Do you have to go this far?
It was your late father's wish to have this drama made.
Father's already in the past.
What I'm interested in is the present and the future.
It's better you leave this house too.
I dont need any of that past.
What is the matter?
I'm here to meet Mr. Choi Pil Seong.
Are you one of his party?
No, it's not that.
It's really urgent. I need to see him as soon as possible.
I'm saying I don't have any time!
Hello I'm Kang Hyun Min.
Omo!
Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
This is really urgent.
We can meet Mr. Choi Pil Seong, right?
I'm sorry to say but your time's up.
Hold on a second. Please wait a little more.
Life is so full of surprises!
Who'd have thought that I'd hit such a jackpot after so many years of drought?
How much did you sell that land for?
Shush! Everybody says that you now have the money saved even for your great-grandchildren.
I get it. I get it.
Since it's my treat today, drink as much as you want.
Who's elder Choi Phil Seong?
I'm writer Lee Go Eun sent by Anthony.
Hold on a second.
I'm 'Morning in Kyeongseong's' writer Lee Go Eun.
I've just returned the investment fund of 3.4 billion won to you.
Returned the Investment fund?
Mr. Anthony, you're one lucky person.
Since you kept your promise, you're free now.
Yes, Mr. Kenji.
I was in the middle of waiting for your call.
What is that about?
Let's say that the promise between you and me was never made.
As promised, Anthony repayed the investment money.
That's not possible.
Where are you at the moment Mr. Kenji.
You don't need to come here.
Yes it's me, Anthony.
What kind of trick did you use?
You shouldn't speak like that to someone you helped.
I was able to resolve this thanks to you who purchased Choi Pil Seong's useless land for 5 times more money than it's worth.
I'll make sure the money is used without waste.
As you wanted, you became Cao Cao.
Unfortunately, you fell off from the Red Cliff to the sea of fire, though. Whatever it is, congratulations.
Like this, our problem is over.
We won't need to see each other again.
How dare you take my money! And mock me?
Thank you very much for keeping your promise.
What have I done here?
Bankers had to do all the work at this late hour.
From now on our drama- what was it again?
'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Oh right, 'Morning in Kyeongseong.' I'm leaving it to you.
Don't worry about it since Korea's best top stars are in it.
I'll also be expecting from the top star.
Wasn't I quite useful?
You're very useful for your skill to torture me by making me wait.
You've tortured me until the very end, but now are you saying you were useful?
Ah, the old saying is never wrong.
"You saved a drowning person, but then that person demands you to bring his bundle too."
If you're going to save a drowning person, of course, you should save his bundle too!
I guess you're fine since you're all pompous like before.
I think I should also say my last farewell.
Ms. Akiko, what are you going to do from now on?
I'll return back to Japan and live like a new person. Even though the chairman has left, please make a really good drama.
I will also watch it.
Why did you hang up without talking about me?
Well, while I was talking to him... The car taken was mine, the one driving is me and the bag was found because of me.
How big my contribution was!
You can't just ignore it!
Oh come on, I'll tell him about it later.
You definitely have to put in the word how big my help was.
If I say it to him myself, it doesn't look good.
So Writer Lee, you should make sure to mention it to him, got it?
We're almost there.
Please turn right here.
You've tortured me until the very end, but now are you saying you were useful?
If you're going to save a drowning person, of course you should save his bundle too!
What were you thinking about that you are giggling like that?
So, you came back alive without being hurt.
Thanks to someone.
Thanks to someone who was so slow, I was shit-scared, indeed.
You must have been really scared. (in informal speach)
Don't talk to me without honorifics.
I was talking to myself right now.
Do I have to use polite form even when I'm talking to myself?
But... why did you come?
I came here to say that.
Representative
If you're that grateful, do you want to get some beer?
How is it?
This is awesome!
Towel!
Let's go one more time Hyun Min.
This is already the 4th time.
Can't you separately film me walking out of the water?
This scene's key point is the main role Kim Woo Jin who has went through all difficulties and survived from the rough sea!
If we use cuts, it won't have the same effect
Let's go for more realistic in one shot.
One more for the last time okay?
You can do it since you're the best actor.
Let's go one more time.
From the point Kim Woo Jin swims!
You can't be shaking like that!
What's with that dog!
You son of a b*tch!
Hey, aren't you going to control this mutt?
Because of the dog-
It's a wrap!
Hyun Min!
You were awesome!
Let's all give a big round of applause for Kang Hyun Min.
Youweregreat!
Goodwork !
Are you alright Hyung?
To the car, to the car, hurry.
Put on the heater.
Heater!
Just watching this is making me cold.
He should experience more hardships.
Even with that, he won't be able to become a real actor, though.
I guess so...
The chairman is coming this way.
The Chairman?
He's on his way with a team of Empire's lawyers.
Legal team...?
The Chairman is here.
Yes? Find any documents about Anthony, even if it's a penny or a single receipt, and hand them over to our legal team! But, considering Anthony's personality,
There isn't?
If there isnt, then isn't it your job to make one?
He's the bastard who made me throw away my money, 8 billion won in the air.
Listen well everybody. If you want to keep eating and living with my money, find it no matter what!
NO MATTER WHAT!
Did you really turn up the heater to the highest?
Yes, Hyung.
Do I look okay?
Hurry up and shut the door. The cold wind is blowing in.
This is warm coffee.
This will make you feel a little warmer.
That's why I told you to cut out this scene from the script.
But after coming here and seeing the shoot, I think keeping it was the right decision. I'm in this state now, but how can you say that?
You looked so awesome today, awesome enough to make all the staff out there fall for you.
Was I that cool?
Of course, you were the best!
Yes. Like Brad Pitt.
Inevitable, huh?
It's been a long time... since the two of us came to the beach like this.
But... why did you want to see me?
To return this.
I'm thankful but everything is solved.
You know it well, don't you?
That we can never know what might happen anywhere, any how.
Something like that won't happen but if it does, I'll take it. So keep it.
How does it feel having your 3-year old work experiencing its first shoot?
Just feel like going back to my regular routine?
Other people may not notice, but you can't fool my eyes.
Representative, you are extremely excited with anticipation right now.
Representative, you might be the person with the smallest understanding of oneself in the world.
Because it has become your habit to hide your feelings and forget about yourself.
You're talking as if you know a lot about me.
Is there anything more I need to know? I'm sorry but erase all the memories you've had with me.
Since I've already erased mine a long time ago.
I'm telling you again as the Director of the Drama Department of SBC. All actions you're making now, please stop them immediately.
So, does that mean that you're supporting Anthony more, not me?
It's because "Morning of Kyeongseong" is also my drama.
Director, the filming crew finished today's shooting and they are about to leave for Seoul now.
By the way, I was wondering if you are going to attend tonight's team dinner.
Of course, I should go to that.
Yes. I understand.
- What are you doing?
- Oh my god, oh my god! You scared me to death!
Being scared is your concern, but I asked what you were doing. When I'm feeling really good or when I'm feeling down, I'm usually doing this by myself.
If you do this, it makes you feel much fresher.
By closing your eyes like this and raising your arms up like wings and start imagining.
I'm free and flying in the sky. Underneath me
I see my work place and I also see my mother's mackerel restaurant.
Just like this after taking a long tour you come down and open your eyes.
It's the weirdest stretch I've ever seen in my life.
Stop doing useless things and hurry up to leave.
Since everyone is waiting because of you.
Everyone, attention, please!
Today, the head director of the SBC Drama Department will say something.
Hello everyone. The director should have done it.
I wish no one gets sick and everything goes well. Should we make a toast?
Everyone, raise your glass, please.
If I say, "Morning of Kyeongseong"...
What do you say Mr. Hyun Min?
Let's go with Daebak.
Daebak is good.
Alright then, 'Morning in Kyeongseong' is daebak.
'Morning in Kyeongseong'!
DAEBAK!
Here, here.
Definitely, Korean beef is different.
These days, Korean farms are having a lot of difficulties, so we should eat Korean beef a lot.
What's up with you, Mr. Kang Hyun Min, treating all the staff with Korean beef?
Well, that costs nothing.
You're really a lot different.
And, I'm the PR ambassador of Korean beef, so I know well about this kind of thing.
this place's meat is the best!
Beef will be served as much as you want, so order as much as you want!
Kang Hyun Min seems to be a better person than what I thought before.
He even knows how to buy for the staff. This isn't paid for with his own money. It's a sponsorship.
Even meat can be sponsored?
Wasn't he treating us because he is the PR ambassador of Korean beef?
That's why he gets that sponsorship.
Alright everyone.
Our actor, Kang Hyun Min, is treating you huge with this clothing for staff!
Well, everyone, take one!
Min Ah, you should have one too.
I prepared one for you!
By any chance, these are also... ?
Sponsored. After all, he's the greatest stingy actor who never spends his own money, even a penny.
WOW! How is it?
Is your illusion about him now breaking?
Yes, you can speak now.
Who did you say you were?
You're pretty shameless.
Looking at you having so much fun after your theft.
I don't know what you mean, but I think you should first say who you are.
I'm Jo Young Eun, the writer of novel "Lovers of Destiny".
Your drama copied my novel.
I don't think you don't know about that.
I don't know about that, but I know one thing very well.
Every time when I make a drama, I get a phone call from people like you.
And whenever that happens, I say like this.
Then go ahead.
Stop your funny trick and get lost.
Unless you want to lose your money for lawyer's fee while trying to get a few pennies by blackmailing.
Representative. What are you doing here?
Let's go in, everyone is waiting.
Alright, I'm going.
Well then everyone, was the meat delicious?
Please go in.
Representative! Representative!
Now is the moment everyone has been waiting for.
We'll now listen to a song from World Production's Representative.
I can't do it so ask someone else.
But still, atleast one song.
That's right Representative. Atleast one song.
Whose theme is it? [a famous Korean classic song "Keumkang Mountain we've missed"]
A clear and pretty mountain!
12,000 mountaintops we've missed so much.
Although they don't say a word.
I'll stop till here.
Is he upset because we laughed?
I will change the mood.
New writer Lee Go Eun will be singing.
PD Joo?
Must we use chopsticks well to eat food?
["Dance with DJ D.O.C" by DJ D.O.C.]
Even if we don't use chopsticks well, we can eat food well!
But when I eat food, people around me always say, "Do you have any problem with this table?"
That was suprising.
The Representative that I know wouldn't be singing in front of people.
I guess I was wrong.
I thought I knew a lot about you.
It seems you've changed.
Everyone changes.
Is that change because of Lee Go Eun?
I'm sorry but you got it completely wrong.
I'm not someone who changes because of anyone.
Even for my change, I choose to change myself.
Ow, my head.
Miss Lee Go Eun.
Ms. Lee Go Eun, here is the registered mail.
You're Miss Lee Go Eun, right?
Sign over here.
Ow, my head.
Regarding to banning airing the drama "Morning of Kyeongseong" for plagiarizing the novel "Lovers of Destiny"?
This is Writer Jo Young Eun.
I'm sorry but I think I told you that I have no interest in your mere novel.
Then, from now on, I think you should develop some interest in my novel.
Because I've also sent the certification of contents to Writer Lee Go Eun.
And you keep saying that I'm blackmailing you with a silly reason... No, let me tell you first why that is a silly blackmail.
What judges and prosecutors hate the most is this kind of plagiarism case.
I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
This is 'Morning of Kyeongseong's' writer Lee Go Eun.
So you are Lee Go Eun?
You don't have to meet.
Yes, I'll see you there then.
She's just trying to stir up controversy to sell more copies of her book.
We'll only find that out after meeting right?
I'll be the one meeting her and taking care of this!
Stop wasting time and just focus on writing your script.
No, this is a problem of me and my pride as a writer.
I'll solve it myself.
You're younger than I had thought... and so rash.
I don't think I deserve to hear such words.
Look here, Ms. Lee Go Eun.
Regardless of how much you want to get fame and success, you shouldn't steal someone else's work and present it as if it is yours.
Can you still call yourself a writer? Stealing? I don't know why you would accuse me like this, but
I haven't stolen anything. My book 'Fated Lovers' was published 5 years ago.
'Morning of Kyeongseong' started 6 years ago.
Besides, the main storyline was finished a year before that, in 2005.
Do you have any evidence?
Your work wasn't even registered for copyright.
Don't think you can get away with this by lying.
You're the one being preposterous here.
I'm the one who's the victim here.
Victim?
Admit to it when I'm putting it nicely.
Admit that you plagiarized my work.
No, I will never agree to it since it's not the truth.
Ms. Lee Go Geun, I'll make sure that your drama never airs.
I'll apply for an injunction of banning the drama's broadcast.
Go deal with it. Let me tell you one more time,
I'm not a writer that steals someone else's work to make a name for myself.
Have you read my book?
You'll know once you read my book.
I'm looking for a novel.
What's the title?
Fated Lovers.
[Questions of Plagiarism on Morning in Kyeongseong, a drama before airing has plagiarized? ]
[Writer Jo Young Eun of 'Fated Lovers' wants to reveal the truth! ]
Whoa, even applying for an injunction of banning our drama broadcast?
Who's calling the kettle black?
Our Writer Lee Go Eun would never plagiarize someone else's work!
She wouldn't even know that plagiarizm is spelled with a p!
How presumptuous of them!
- Stop worrying about it.
What they want is exactly this type of attention from the ignorant masses.
So don't concern yourself with this and do your work.
PD Joo, come see me for while.
Then, what if it gets accepted?
Then, the drama won't get aired at all.
The drama won't get aired?
But that won't happen to us, so don't worry.
Go make some coffee now.
But.. there's no way that Writer Lee would have plagiarized.
Is it really necessary to do all that?
We have to be ready to face them, not sit around doing nothing.
Don't you think it might be the Empire's doing?
It's not the Empire.
This is too small of an issue for it to be an attack from them.
[Application for an injunction of banning Morning in Kyeongseong in progress]
Is this your doing?
No Chairman.
Of course not, it had better not be you!
If you thought of stooping down to such petty tricks like this and stain my reputation, you'd be dead, too!
It's definitely not me Chairman.
Then, fine!
Just focus on what I told you to do!
No matter what, we've got to find some evidence that can put that bastard Anthony in jail!
That's your top priority!
Yes, Chairman.
Alright, Let's start.
As you may already know by now, there is a plagiarism controversy about "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Has anyone read the 'Fated Lovers'?
I took a look at it, and it seems that it's not something that can be overlooked.
However, given that they're both set in the Japanese colonization period, some similarities are inevitable.
Some parts in the book are indeed similar, I must admit. Especially the character of the female protagonist is the same, so that can be a problem for us.
If it comes to that, things will get really serious.
We have to prepare some kind of a counterplan.
Who knows if Writer Lee Go Eun really did plagiarize her work?
Alright, I understand.
Let me first discuss this matter with writer Lee Go Eun.
Writer Lee, it's me. Director Nam, I surprised you by coming here without calling you right?
But this way, I can check on you and make sure that you're working on your script.
Can I get a cup of tea?
Yes, sure. Come in.
Wow, you've done quite a bit of background research.
[Fated Lovers]
But still if you had called, I would have prepared something.
No, no need for that.
You must be the busiest person right now.
A cup of tea is just fine.
I'll drink it well.
Ahh, this is peppermint flavor.
Are you doing well?
I know what you want to tell me.
You're here because of the plagiarism issue right?
Is it written on my face?
I really didn't steal it.
You know, as one gets older, his needless worries grow bigger, too.
Writer Lee, you should just concentrate on writing your script, and I'll discuss this matter with Representative Kim.
What do you think Attorney Park? Before we get to that, this writer called Lee Go Eun is she someone trustworthy?
Why do you ask?
I think this is going to be a tough case. The other party has hired someone with a good track record with plagiarism cases like this, Lawyer Jang Hyun Jae.
Attorney Jang?
The retainer must be quite hefty.
This writer of "Fated Lovers"
has put her fate on the line with this lawsuit. Unless you can provide some kind of a firm evidence, the injunction of banning the drama's broadcast may be granted.
[Morning in Kyeongseong, a drama before airing in a plagiarism controversy? ] As you had asked,
I've brought all the accounting records of production budgets of the dramas that Anthony had produced while he was working in Empire.
Oh, right. About that plagiarism controversy of "Morning in Kyeongseong,"
you didn't have a hand in it, did you, Director Heo?
I did meet with the Writer and introduced Lawyer Choi and media reporters to her.
Lawyer Choi is pretty good in that area. Director Heo, is this the time to work on something so petty?
Were you thinking of tarnishing my reputation with such a pathetic trick?
Shall I stop them, then?
Just leave it. However,
I didn't hear about this.
You know, sometimes, I envy your attitude of always making such bold statements in full confidence.
Let me ask you one thing.
It's only that.
I know there should be a back-up CD with a saved copy somewhere... Ah, email.
I'd sent it to Writer Jung before.
Email...
[Questions of plagiarism on Morning in Kyeongseong.
Similarities to a 5-year old novel.]
[Application for an injunction of banning the broadcast of "Morning in Kyeongseong" in progress] Writer Jo Young Eun of "Fated Lovers" wants to reveal the truth!
[The only experience she had was as an assistant writer.
I suppose she plagiarized because she had no talent.]
[I was gonna watch it because of Min Ah, but I guess not. If she can't write, she shouldn't be called a writer.]
[Rookie writer?
Plagiarizer?
] [She shouldn't have done it if she's got no talent.]
This is completely a pig's sty!
No matter how busy you are, you should atleast clean up!
What is this mess? That's right.
What brings you here?
What brings me here...
I brought some side dishes for you.
Just take a taxi.
Got money to burn?
Just make sure not to skip your meals no matter how busy you are.
Go Eun Ah...
Keep this is mind
You... are Park Kang Ja's daughter despite what anyone says.
I raised you without much money and without a father, but I still put in a lot of love and care into you!
That's why you need to make sure that you take good care of yourself and stay healthy while you work.
Yeah, Mom.
Oh my, the bus is here.
Mom is going.
Eat well and work.
Alright, alright!
[Director Goo]
Yes, Director. Writer Lee, is the writing going well? is the writing going well?
Don't pay any attention to that plagiarism thingy.
It happens quite frequently in this field.
But... you might have to come here for a while.
you might have to come here for a while.
min Ah is asking to revise the script.
It's the scenes that we're shooting today.
We're shooting in the studio right now.
If you could come, I'd really appreciate it.
Excuse me, Director.
Can we get something to eat since I'm really hungry.
Aigoo. We cannot have our actor hungry.
Alright then, we'll take a 30 minute break.
Ms. Sung Min Ah.
Judging from the underlines on your script, I guess you're trying to cram your lines at the last minute?
While I'm eating, make sure you finish memorizing them.
If you have time to eat, why don't you analyze your character more in depth?
If you don't want me the steal the scene.
Sure, so you're going to challenge me? When the right opportunity comes, I'll crush you down for sure!
The little things that annoy me!
Hyung, this is bad.
- About Writer Lee Go Eun.
Because of the plagiarism controversy, there's a lot of internet hate speech.
I don't know about others but Lee Go Eun would never do something like that.
If it was plagiarized, it was the other writer that did it!
It must be right? If I think about it, Writer Lee Go Eun is right.
I think Hyun Min is seriously committed this time.
He's still got a long way to go, though.
If he's going to match Sung Min Ah's acting.
So now we've just got two solitary scenes of Min Ah, right?
Is the shooting going well?
I've got to make sure that you're not out of practice, Director Goo.
Sure, watch me carefully and judge for yourself if I'm out of practice or not.
I guess it's break time?
Yeah, while we're shooting, Min Ah said she had something to talk with Writer Lee.
Writer Lee?
She wants some of her lines changed.
I heard that Writer Lee just got here.
It may take some time for you to witness my not-so-out-of-practice skills in directing.
I heard that you wanted me to adjust a few lines.
Please have a sit.
What's the matter with all these lines?
Director, it seems they forgot to turn off the mike.
No leave it.
Let's hear what they're talking about.
We have nothing special to do anyway.
Never mind. Episode 1, scene 43, the fourth... Gwang Soo, isn't that the voice of Sung Min Ah and writer Lee Go Eun?
Hyung, I guess the microphone isn't turned off.
It's not only that.
You're asking me to change this now?
The lines that are underlined all need to be changed so that we can start shooting right away.
There's no way I can act with those lines.
Seriously Sung Min Ah, don't you think you're over doing it?
Even though I'm a new writer...
It's not that. Unless you want to be branded as a plagirizer for the rest of your career, change them.
What is it that you want to say right now?
You should know it very well.
I'm sure you've read the book 'Fated Lovers.'
Looking at your expression, I guess you did read it.
How was it? The character of the female protagonist, similar lines, is it just me who's seeing the similarities?
Tell me, is it just me who's seeing it?
I saw it too.
I acknowledge the fact that there are similarities.
Turn off the mic. I didn't see it before, but were you such a shameless person from the beginning? Even though the two works are similar,
I didn't steal it. 'Morning in Kyeongseong' is something I wrote with my own strength.
How should I believe that?
It's true! There are similar lines because the settings are similar, and that's because it's set in the Japanese Colonization period...
Do you think that's a valid excuse?
Didn't you admit it.
I heard it all because the mic was on.
Writer Lee
I'm really disappointed. Whatever the case, start changing these.
With these lines, as long as my name is involved, I can't act.
What... did you just say?
I'm telling you to follow this script without trying to change it.
Representative Kim.
No matter what, we have to get the drama aired on the scheduled date.
Plus I have one request.
Don't call out the writer and demand for any change in the script from now on.
What are you doing not working on your script?
Getting the drama aired is important, but my innocence is important to me, too.
In order to take care of the injunction on banning the broadcast, yes, both are important.
At the end, even you don't believe me.
Yes, I do. I may not believe anybody in this world,
I may not even believe in myself sometimes, but that me believes in you.
Next week on King Of Dramas. Everybody, I am the representative of the production company, Anthony Kim.
This "Morning in Kyeongseong" that we are all working on should not become a drama of distrust.
The truth that "Morning in Kyeongseong" is wholly created by our writer and that it is our rightful drama, Writer Lee Go Eun and I vouch for it.
Nay, we have to believe it.
And we will prove that truth.
Meanwhile, we need to continue shooting "Morning in Kyeongseong!"
Director, it's me. Ah, yes. Please turn on the microphone again.
Microphone?
Turn on the microphone.
Everyone, I'm Anthony Kim, the representative of the production company.
"Morning in Kyeongseong" which you guys are making now must not become a piece of distrust.
"Morning in Kyeongseong" is solely the creation made by our writer and us.
Not only Writer Lee Go Eun but I guarantee that fact.
No, we must believe that!
And I will prove that truth.
Instead, "Morning of Kyeongsong" must keep being filmed.
That's all I want to say.
Therefore, please act without any doubt. Even so, if you still can't trust this script, then trust me and act for that role.
To air our drama without any problem, we need some solid proof to show you wrote "Morning in Kyeongseong" first.
And we should submit that proof to the court by the day after tomorrow, Wednesday.
That novelist said she wrote her first draft in 2006, right?
Yes.
Then, we just need to find the file which you wrote earlier than 2006. I know that, but ...
But? It was a long time ago, so although I looked for it everywhere, I couldn't find it.
Then, what about e-mail?
Then, what about another computer?
Have you ever worked with another computer, not your current laptop?
Other than my laptop?
Yes, other than your laptop.
Teacher Jeong? (Writer Jeong) In the laptop of Writer Jeong Hong Joo's studio, which I'd used when I was her assistant, there might be my file left.
It seems she's now abroad.
Where is her studio now?
What on earth are you going to do later after this?
I'm doing this to go in.
Writer Jeong will understand us too. Uh, by the way, you two, are you really the owners of this house?
This isn't the first time my wife has done something like this.
I'm a bit... careless.
We have a big age gap, but how could you say I'm your "wife"?
Honey..
You should install a new doorlock now.
You know that, right?
What are doing not looking for it?
No, I trust you.
I may not trust anyone in the world, and may not even trust myself,
But I.. trust you.
See I told you! /i
Doesn't it feel better coming out?
I just came with you since you looked so nervous for your debut.
Let's leave after a while.
I'm not nervous at all.
I don't believe in anyone.
Sometimes, I don't trust myself either.
But there's one thing I have the ultimate trust in.
And that is how you will be the nation's, no the world's top star.
Don't tell me you use those words to seduce women?
Now you seem more like a woman.
Later, act with your feeling now.
It will be helpful.
The file I last saved was in 2011.
I guess everything was erased and newly saved again.
We don't need to wait and see any longer. Well, in front of the actors and staff, the writer came forward and admitted that.
Even if it's a bit late, we should prepare the replacement now.
But is it really true that Writer Lee admitted that herself? Since Sung Min Ah pushed and asked her, she said that it's true that those two pieces are similar.
They seemed similar to each other even when I read them. I will submit these materials to the court as evidence, but with only these,
I can't guarantee the result.
In the worst case scenario, the injunction to prohibit the airing of the drama, will be approved.
When is the submission of evidence due?
It's by midnight today.
PD Joo.
Contact that novelist.
Tell her I want to meet her before that due time.
What are you going to do when you meet her?
She won't accept any deal for settlement.
Even if I have to kneel down or beg her, I should do whatever I can.
Even if we have to put her name as the writer of the original story, the drama must be aired.
For now, Lawyer Park, go to the court and submit these materials. PD Joo, find out where Writer Jo Young Eun is right now.
Then, let's get going.
Do you have writer's block?
You must be nervous because the first broadcast day is coming up.
Yeah, it must be.
Aigoo.. Aigoo, why are you crying like a fool? At your elementary school literary contest, you said that it was embarrassing when I was crying.
Why have you kept them still?
Do you think that's all?
I still have that too.
When you say 'plastic thing'.. was it like this small?
Sure is!
Mom, where is it?
Morning in Kyeongseong - 03.14.2005.
Lee Go Eun First Draft
Is that something important?
I'm saved!
How much is that?
It's priceless!
That's such a relief.
I got a hold of Writer Jo Young Eun.
She says she'll wait for you at a cafe near her house in Heuksukdong.
I said, "I found it!"
I found the first draft of "Morning in Kyeongseong" I wrote back in 2005!
Oh, taxi!
Then, we're good.
Props team, get them ready!
Bring those chairs this way!
Still no contact from Anthony?
A decision will be made by court today..
Do you want to try calling?
Alright, let's start filming!
What is your reason?
Ok, cut!
Shoot me if you can.
Crazy Bastard
I said, tell me!
Stop filming.
Yeah. It's me, Representative Kim.
The court has made a decision.
And the result?
What..?
I'll pass the message.
The result pertaining to the broadcast of "Morning in Kyeongseong" has arrived.
It has been determined that..
"Morning in Kyeongseong" is not a plagiarized script.
It's an original piece of work!
Without an ounce of suspicion, let's do our best for the first broadcast!
Understood, everyone?
Such a crybaby.
Thank you, Representative.
Don't be disorganized in the future.
Get your stuff copyrighted, take good care of all your files, and save back-ups.
Crying and laughing, way to make a scene.
But it looks expensive.
Aigoo, seriously! I'm in a skirt!
Stop acting like you're so clean.
You're just dirty.
A.K?
Can't you tell by looking?
Ah..
Was your name Anthony from the very beginning?
I mean, even though your parents lived in the United States for so long. They're still Korean, so wouldn't they give you a Korean name?
No such thing.
My name was Anthony from the day I was born.
How can there be Anthony in a Korean name?
What do your parents think?
I never asked them.
Then call them and ask them.
They both passed a long time ago.
You don't need to feel sorry since I'm not concerned in any way.
Then should I give you a Korean name?
What would be good?
Kim..
How about 'Kim Young Man'?
You get insulted by a lot of people. So, short for Kim Yok Mani (lots of insults),
Kim Yong Man.
Are you having fun, messing with me?
Very much so.
40 Woo 6976...6976 Please, pull over... 40 Woo 6976...
Aish!
Since it is your fault, cover the fine yourself.
I'm not the one driving, why do I have to pay?
You've ran a stoplight. Please show me your license.
Aigoo, you're working hard.
Since I have to attend an urgent matter and something like this won't happen again, can't you let us off this time?
Yes, please don't do it again.
But give me your driver's license.
Your license has expired already. Requesting identity confirmation, requesting identity confirmation,
Resident Registration NO.: 741104-1675138.
The name, Kim Bong Dal?
Kim as in Kimchi, Bong as in bongos, and Dal as in Dallas.
Kim Bong Dal.
Aye, why is he saying that?
Kim Bong D... No freaking way!
Anthony is Kim Bong Dal... that's his real name!
Awesome...
You said you didn't have a Korean name.
I wonder if that's an American name too.
Kim Bong..
Dal~?
I'm sorry, but the name is so irresistible.
Kim as in Kimchi, Bong as in Bongos, [Bong means mountain top]
Dal as in Dallas.
[Dal means the moon.]
It's so funny!
I'm sorry but ...
It's too funny! Kimchi... Bongwoori (meaning "mountain peak"),
Daldeongee (meaning "round face like the moon"). So, November 4th is our Kim Bong Dal's birthday.
Yes, the door is not locked.
You're surprised, aren't you?
It's just a joke!
Oh, oh my... I'm sorry.
You must have been so surprised.
I thought it was someone else.
Not at all.
Would you like to come in? I guess you've been writing the script, so I'm afraid if I'm interrupting now.
Not at all. Please have a seat.
I don't have anything but coffee, is that okay?
I came to apologize.
I'd like to apologize sincerely.
Misunderstanding about your script, that was my mistake.
No, I understand why you misunderstood. When I read that book,
I also thought that different people could come up with similar ideas.
If you think in that way, I'm thankful.
But, there's something I was curious about.
What's the relationship between you and Representative?
Was my question a bit odd?
I was curious about that from the beginning. Anthony Kim, the previous Representative of Empire Production, isn't a person who would wager everything he has on a newbie writer's drama.
What's up with you two?
No, there is nothing between the two of us, what do you mean, "relationship"?
I totally hate a man with that kind of style.
What kind of women in the world would like a man like him? Well, if we must put the word "relationship", "relationship" of a demon and an angel?
Just... a vicious representative of drama production company and an angel-like writer?
Something like that?
But why are you asking that?
From now on, all of us must run for the highest rating of the first episode of "Morning in Kyeongseong" on November 5th!
How are our competitors of other broadcasting stations going now?
Currently, "Return of the King" of K Broadcasting is running as the number one in ratings.
Followed by "Between Lovers" of M Broadcasting in the second.
Then, what about S Broadcasting?
Its drama is in last with one digit rating (under 10%).
I don't think we can get any advantage from the previous drama's rating.
Last Tuesday's rating was 6.2%.
It was the worst.
It seems we will have a hard fight.
Of course it will be hard, but no matter what, we will win.
All of them were instructed by you, Chairman, but all accounts and transactions were done under the name of Anthony.
Other than that, he didn't steal even a single penny from my money?
That's unexpected.
Well, with these, he would be rotting in a prison for at least 10 years.
Contact our legal team and let them proceed.
Yes, PD Kim.
I called you because I heard our "Morning in Kyeongseong" will be introduced at your "Entertainment Tonight".
Then, please take good care of that.
I've sent the revised script for episode 7.
Mr. Kim.
Dal.
Yes, Mom.
Hey, we have big trouble.
Come quickly to our restaurant.
There are so many customers here!
Aigo...
I can't do this by myself!
Is that big trouble?
Of course, it is!
Top star, Kang Hyun Min is visiting here himself!
Mr. Kang Hyun Min?
To promote Writer Lee's "Morning in Kyeongseong", I'm here.
They are from my fan club.
- Everyone!
- Yes! This person is the beautiful writer of our "Morning in Kyeongseong", Writer Lee Go Eun.
- Writer Lee.
Please say something. Please say something. Please say something.
Ah... Yes...
I'm Writer Lee Go Eun.
Nice to meet you all.
Our "Morning in Kyeongseong"
will be aired soon.
There are not many days left until its first episode.
Please promote our drama a lot.
Our "Morning in Kyeongseong" and here Mr.Kang Hyun Min, no, from now on, Kim Woo Jin (the role's name), you will give lots of love to them, right?
But, seriously, why are you here?
I'm sorry for misunderstanding your drama, Writer Lee.
I thought that apologizing with only words wouldn't be enough.
So, you want to apologize with money and your fans?
Because I have nothing but only money and fans!
Then, I will get going for filming now.
Again, sorry! See you later!
Yes, Representative?
You want me to amend all of the script for episode 7?
Not all of them but Scene 42 and Scene 43 with that clumsy melodrama part.
Clum...clumsy?
It even has the kiss scene of the main two characters, but where do you mean is it clumsy?
Writer Lee, when you kiss a man, are you doing it in this way?
No, I mean, have you ever kissed a man?
I have!
Then, do it.
In my eyes, the kiss scene in Scene 43 gives only the feeling of two wooden sticks hitting each other.
So, I'm telling you to try it yourself, Writer Lee.
PD Joo, read out loud Scene 43.
Well, everyone, let's see.
Scene 43, inside of Modern Club. Sad piano music is filling the empty club,
Kim Woo Jin is sitting alone in front of the piano and playing it.
At this moment, with tip-tap, tip-tap sound of high heels, a woman approaches Woo Jin.
I told you to try it yourself.
Even if Woo Jin sensed Hye Rin coming near him, he doesn't stop playing. Hye Rin grabs his hand.
Woo Jin stops playing the piano.
Hye Rin speaks. "From now on, your playing piano, can you do it only for me?"
Woo Jin stays still, not taking his eyes off the piano.
Hye Rin speaks.
"Even if I lie to you, even if I .... even if I betray you, I'm asking if you can play the piano, only for me."
"No." After that, Woo Jin stands up, staring at Hye Rin, and kisses her?
Even that dumb Kang Hyun Min won't be able to grab Sung Min Ah and kiss her!
I'm not an actress, though!
A writer is supposed to write to make actors act!
If you feel so wronged, then go ahead, ask these male viewers what they think.
What I can do for you is...
NG!
Min Ah, this is already the fourth NG. It's not a difficult line, but what's wrong?
I'm sorry, Director.
Then, let's take a 10-minute break!
We will resume after 10-minute break!
What are you doing, being so childish?
Then, what about you, Miss Sung Min Ah?
You childishly doubted Writer Lee, but have you apologized to her?
What's that with today's filming?
If you humiliated a person publicly, shouldn't you officially apologize to her in front of all of them?
I apologized to her officially, so please, stop that moronic act.
Mo~ron!
Moronic act?
That's right! You will keep experiencing that! This Kang Hyun Min's revenge, it's Season One, Two, Three, Four!
It will be continued!
Hyung, have you read the script for episode 7?
The revision has been made from episode 1, so the melodrama line starts sooner too.
There is even a kiss scene with Miss Sung Min Ah.
Kissing scene?
But as per the assistant director, it will be revised.
Representative, then, we will go home now.
Okay, you've worked hard today.
Since tomorrow is our first air date, have a good sleep tonight.
You will need to run around all day, tomorrow.
We will leave, then.
Scene#43, Inside of Modern Club.
I can't even kiss?
Should I experience a kiss to write well about a kiss scene?
Then, what about a story about a serial killer? Its writer should be a serial killer?
How absurd it is...
Excuse me ... Ah, because of that damn Kim Bong Dal, I can't focus on the right feeling.
Kim Bong Dal's Birthday!
Didn't you go home?
I have some business to do with you, Representative.
Business?
Anthony, Anthony, Anthony~ Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday, dear Representative!
Happy birthday to you~~!
Representative, happy birthday!
What are you doing now?
Today is your birthday, Representative.
Your ID number...
Kimchi, Bongwoori ("peak"), Daldeongee ("moon face")!
I'm sorry, but can't you see I'm working now?
Stop interrupting and get out, please.
That's what I'm saying!
Geez. Maybe today isn't his birthday.
That's weird, because I heard it clearly.
Maybe he had something bad earlier.
Is he sulking now? Anyway, I'm sorry!
What are you sorry for?
We'll escort you to your studio.
Ah, really?
- Yes. - Oh, we're mannered guys.
By the way, what are they about, Kimchi, Bongwoori, Dalmaji ("viewing the moon")?
No, it's Daldeongee ("Moon face")!
Can I meet you now?
I will wait at the cafe.
It's the ring, which you cherished as if it was your life because you believed it protected your success.
It won't be exactly same as that one, but it will look almost same.
Please make sure to succeed with this drama too.
Thank you, but I'd like to decline this present.
Please just accept it.
I'm sorry but this one... can't be that ring.
It's the ring, which you cherished as if it was your life because you believed it protected your success.
Even when you're in the States, don't skip your meals, and take good care of your health.
Your attention, please.
Passengers for New York, ... Oh, dear. You'd better go now.
I will go, then.
He-hey!
This is your father's ring.
Hurry up, or you will be late.
Hurry up, go!
It seems you're busy these days. Today she was anticipating you more than usual, wanting to stay up until late, and just went to bed.
Did you have some seaweed soup?
[Seaweed soup is traditionally eaten on b-days]
Weren't you asleep?
I should have taken care of it but since my body's like this.
That's why you have to quickly get up and leave this place.
So that you can cook seaweed soup for me.
Since I saw your face, it's okay now.
You must be busy.
Hurry and leave.
Be careful when you leave.
I look forward to the first broadcast tomorrow.
It'll go well, don't worry too much.
You are your mom's son.
Finally, it's tomorrow.
my new destiny will start.
Will I be smiling at the end of that destiny?
I'll be able to smile.
No, I just hope that I will be able to smile.
Today, the food is free in celebration of 'Morning in Kyeongseong's' first broadcast!
Today, the food is on me!
Yes, it's all free!
The day we've all been waiting for, the first broadcast day of "Morning in Kyeongseong," has finally arrived.
Send the press release materials to all media venues, as we have to let the whole country know about the premier of our drama!
Yes, understood!
Revise the final trailer and get it aired starting 9 hours before the premier.
Include scenes that haven't been relased so far...
I think that'd be better.
Ok, start music here.
Team Leader Han, make sure that the entertainment news show, that airs tonight, goes smoothly.
Lastly, each of you can leave a message to the viewers throughout the country.
Dear Viewers, 'Morning in Kyeongseong', the show you've been waiting for will have its first broadcast tonight at 9:55.
Yes, I hope that many of you will watch it.
This concludes the coverage of "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Have you had dinner?
Good work people.
It's a wrap for today.
Tonight, let's all enjoy the first episode in the comfort of our own respective homes.
Ah, time is so slow.
How many more minutes?
Are you really not going to watch the first episode?
Unni, you know about my jinx.
If I watch the first episode, the viewership rating sucks.
ok, I understand.
- I'm leaving, rest well
Why did you want me to come all the way here?
Monitor the live viewership ratings along with your script of the episode.
See for yourself what element excites the viewers and what makes them change the channel.
From now on until the 20th episode, you are breathing with the viewers.
You're here?
You've made a comeback after 3 years.
I'll accept that after 70 minutes.
Congratulaitons, writer Lee.
Finally, you've become a real writer.
Broadcasting in 3 minutes.
Watch that viewership rating graph carefully.
The life and death of all of us is on that line of destiny.
1 minute.
In a few minutes, the drama my daughter wrote will be on.
5seconds 4,3 ,2 ,1 Start! 4,3 ,2 ,1 Start!
We have a start with 7.1%
Not a great start.
What do we do? It's been 30 minutes, and it's at 6.8%.
We're still the lowest.
It's still in the middle of the broadcast!
It's only been 30 minutes since the show started.
Half an hour has passed already and the rating is in the pits.
In total misery.
So you're here.
That's why I told you. We need to go for melodrama, not Noir.
Ajummah, can I get a glass here, too?
I'm going to drink too.
Go work on your script.
The show just finished.
The average viewership rating has been calculated.
Speak.
The viewership rating result is in?
We must have had a spike towards the end.
Viewership rating is 15.7%.
We're in the lead!
15.7!
This is awesome!
We've hit it off big!
- Jackpot!
This is just the beginning.
We're first!
15.7%
- 15.7% - Thanks, Lord!
15.7%?
First?
Yes, what did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you 'Morning in Kyeongseong' would be a success?
I'm Anthony after all.
I should go work on the script with this energy!
Forget the script, tonight you should drink!
Yes, I understand.
Finally the era of Kang Hyun Min has started.
Conquer Korea, then Japan, China, Taiwan, and then the whole world!
Didn't I tell you we'd definitely be success?
Tch!
Don't you remember what you just said a while ago?
What did I tell you?
We shouldn't have gone with Noir.
When did I?
At any rate, I think this is meaningful in so many different ways.
Especially that we got the highest rating with a genre that hadn't been attempted in Korea before. Of course, the producer's eye in discerning the right script was especially crucial.
What about the promising writer's writing skills with tenacity?
You sure are a promising writer, but you still have a long way to go.
At any rate, a drama writer needs to know how to write good melodrama.
Nothing like that pathetic kissing scene.
That talk again! Tell me truthfully, you've never had a kiss right?
That of cours-
You haven't felt your heart beating for a man.
I've felt it before.
Not just a childish crush.
I've definitely,
You've definitely not experienced that.
Seriously, aren't you drinking a little too much?
You were already drinking before I came here.
Mere alcohol can't defeat me.
PD Joo, where are you?
Soowon?
Well, it's just... no, never mind.
Ah man, ah, darn!
Mere alcohol what?
Can't defeat me?
Seriously!
I guess... it's my fault... for drinking with him.
Sleep well. [dropping the honorifics]
Don't ever drink again!
How do you think of me as a man?
See you tomorrow~ Preview So what you two are saying right now..
..is that you have a problem with the kiss scene in episode 7? That's right.
You are under arrest for professional negligence and misappropriation of funds.
Exactly why do you hate me so much?
Stop sabotaging the production of "Morning in Kyeonseong," alread!
Please! How dare you order me around?
If you've got a nice lady friend, you can bring her to me.
I'll show you when I find one.
What have you been doing all those years without ever dating a boyfriend?
How I hate him, hate him.
The mother of Mr. Kim Bong Dal is seriously ill.
Mo, mother?
Episode 12 No enemy is permanent How do you think of me as a man? Well...
This is called "melodrama". This heartbeating, fluttering, this is "melodrama" right there! So, now, go and revise that melodrama scene.
What was that? That scared me... What kind of human being is he?
How do you think of me as a man?
But why couldn't I say no at that moment?
That was because I was toyed in a flash.
Crazy Bong Dal...
So embarrassing!
I have something to say, so open the door first.
What do you have to say?
You didn't answer me before.
I'm thinking of you in this way.
Oh, that was a relief. (because it was a dream.)
What's a relief?
What time do you think it is now that you're still in bed?
Since when have you been here?
Since a little while ago.
When I came in, you were pawing the air as if you were a turtle which was flipped over.
Even if you are the producer, how could you come in a female writer's studio thoughtlessly?
This is a writer's studio paid by my money and opened by me.
But that writer didn't even answer the phone call and didn't show any reaction to the door because she was too busy sleeping.
So, what else can I do, then?
If you need to sleep that much, do you think you can survive in this drama industry?
Why did you come?
Hurry and revise the melodrama scene of episode 7 and send it to us.
We need to film that scene on this Thursday.
I will revise that scene!
Do it quickly! Well!
Even if you don't tell me to go, I will leave.
And from now on, even if you're sleeping, when I call you, answer it.
Because I don't want to see you pawing the air when I'm so busy.
Ah, seriously... "Morning in Kyeongseong", from the first episode, wins Monday-Tuesday.
Woo hoo~ "Morning in Kyeongseong", from the first episode, wins Monday-Tuesday.
"Kang Hyun Min's charisma was shining."
"Indeed, it was Kang Hyun Min, just like everybody said."
[Sung Min Ah, her comeback drama after 3 years shows its signal of success."
Min Ah, what are you doing?
Oh, you're here.
"Morning in Kyeongseong", the pioneer of new drama genre." Catching two birds and great harmony between a veteran director and a newbie writer.
"Writer Lee Go Eun, I've never heard of her name, but she's the best!" "Even if she's a newbie, her writing is awesome!"
Then, let's proceed with it accordngly.
You've worked hard! You've work hard. Well, and this one has not only a good rating, but also the reaction (from the viewers) is really great.
It went so viral. This drama hit the jackpot, jackpot!
Did it? Well, I think, our Writer Lee Go Eun, don't you think we should start managing her? (meaning "keeping her")
Do you know what people on the internet say about Lee Go Eun?
They say "the next Writer Kim Soo Hyun (one of the best Korean drama writers)".
I think we should give her at least a present or something.
What kind of present do you think would be good?
- A present?
CP Lee.
- Let's calm down a little bit, please.
- Calm down?
I will leave now.
So, not a present, but calm down?
Is this Writer Lee Go Eun?
Yes. Who is it?
This is Reporter Kim Eun Hee from Woo Ri Daily Newspaper.
I called you because I'd like to have an interview.
Interview?
With you, Writer Lee.
You want to have an interview with me?
Yes, Reporter Kim.
But, can I pick the place? (to have an interview)
Is there any special reason you picked this place?
Because "Morning in Kyeongseong" started from this place.
When I was living here, I came up with its idea and wrote its first draft.
Who is the first one you think of or you are grateful of?
Of course it's my mom, Mrs. Park Kang Ja.
If it weren't for my mom, I wouldn't have been able to write again.
- Your Mother?
Oh, and there is one more person.
Who is that person?
Mr. Kim Bong Dal.
How does it feel to be outside?
It has been a while since you had fresh air.
I feel so good.
I can hear the sound of spring coming, too.
The sound of spring coming?
For spring to come, we still have to wait for a long time. Like the sound of spring coming,
I can hear the sound of some welcome guest coming.
That drama was really enjoyable.
If you think it's enjoyable, then it's really enjoyable.
It's rating is really good, too.
You've worried a lot, haven't you?
From the beginning, I knew it would be successful.
I will be able to know how good a woman she is.
If I have, I will show her to you, then.
Umm.. For a while, even if you're busy, please come visit her often.
Even though she doesn't show it, her condition has been quite bad these days.
Yes, speaking.
This is Prosecutor Kim Dong Chan from the Taxation Investigation Unit of Seoul Central Prosecutor's Office.
There is a complaint filed against you, so you should come now.
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
I'm saying you've been summoned.
Unless you want to be humiliated in front of your family, COME HERE RIGHT AWAY! So, you're saying you can't admit all the charges described here?
Yes, that's right.
But, according to the materials we've received, the evidence is pretty clear.
From 2006, 2007 and... until 2009.
It seems like the material submitted by Empire Production.
Even all the little details about you are described. I understand how you feel now, but let's proceed with it simply not dragging too much time.
Please let me have a cross-examination with Oh Jin Wan, the accuser.
A little while ago, Anthony was summoned to the Prosecutor's office and interrogated.
As you wish, I will arrange the cross-examination with the accuser, so see you next time.
Yes, PD Joo.
Were you occupied, by any chance?
I couldn't reach you for a while.
But why (did you look for me)?
Well, I called you to ask if you want to see today's episode at the broadcasting control room again.
Of course, I should be there.
It's delivery service.
Are you Lee Go Eun?
Please take this.
Could you sign here, please?
Work hard. Yes.
WriterLeeGo Eun!
Cheeringforyouforever!
[CP Lee Sung Jo]
I guess you really like that gift?
Oh, you came?
Man, he's so shallow.
Look how his attitude towards you has changed overnight.
But, why are you here?
Why do you think I'm here?
To congratulate you on getting the lead in ratings.
Congratulations for you.
Please come in.
Essentially, the viewership rating went up right at that moment.
A vertical spike!
What is it that you want to tell me?
"Tell you"?
That's the way it always is.
You always ask me for some favor when you come.
It's alright, you can say it. Hey,
I really came just to congratulate you.
I said it's alright.
What is it this time?
About the kiss scene...
Isn't it rather awkward?
It's like putting two stick figures together.
I'm working on a revision anyway,
Oh really!
We shouldn't be sitting around here.
Let's get out.
I'll buy you a gift.
A Gift?
I have noticed that your.. winter wardrobe seems rather... lacking.
I'll buy you a warm, cozy winter jumper.
You want to buy me a winter jumper?
Yes. I'll buy it.
As much as I want?
Anything you want!
Take your pick!
Do you have this in size 100?
That color is not good.
This is the newest!
Actually, I don't like to wear something unless it's from the newest line.
Mr. Hee Jae, I heard that this winter is going to be warm.
It looks too warm.
Up to how many can I get for free with the sponsorship?
Just two.
Darn it...!
We have a good start from the get go.
I think the second episode will have an even higher rating!
In the end... that was what you wanted?
Just do as I say.
That's a wrap.
Listen, our show is being aired just fine, so let's focus on our work!
Thisshissallbecoz.... Brrrrrr. Brrrr, ah, man, my tongue is stiff.
Ah. Let's do it again.
Why did my tongue get so stiff?
Sorry. I'm sorry.
This is all all...*cough* Uh, I'm sorry. Uh, I feel bad.
It's winter, you know.
This is all becox of your....
Man, I forgot my line!
Ah, Ms. Ji Yeon, what is my next line? Do you know? Min Ah, are your knees ok?
I can tolerate this much.
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?
Sorry, Min Ah.
Search for it over there.
Are you alright? Oops.. I'm sorry, Director!
My hand was freezing, so I guess I aimed wrong. I'm sorry! Well, if you can, for the hitting scene, let's go without an NG.
Oh, what should I do?
I guess my hand is still freezing, what should I do...?
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Let's go again.
Oh, what was my next line?
Ji Yeon!
What was my next line?
What on earth is the reason you're doing this to me?
That was good!
Sure, I'm fine!
Oh, it's swollen, so red!
What should we do...?
We'll move to the next location in 30 minutes.
I can see you're drooling.
By the way, that person, I've never seen her before.
She is the new FD.
Ah, FD... [Meet Writer Lee Go Eun of "Morning of Kyeongseong", the new drama in the news.]
".... and she expressed her gratitude to Mr. Kim Bong Dal as well." Representative, the photo of Writer Lee looks really great, doesn't it?
Well, just so-so.
By the way, who do you think would be that Kim Bong Dal?
But, isn't his name so funny?
These days, people don't use such a rustic name.
Kim Bong Dal...?
Koo Hee Jae.
Don't concern about other people's names, and do your job driving properly.
In a situation of divergent love, they're kissing...
Kiss... By grabbing her hand, Woo Jin stops her from leaving.
The door is not locked.
Ah, one sec...
That dumb expression?
What's wrong with my expression?
Aren't you curious?
What do you mean "what"?
The rating for episode 2, I mean.
Ah, how was it?
16.2%. We're still the highest, but with the second highest, the difference is only 0.8%, so don't loosen up yet.
Did you revise that kiss scene?
From now on, do it well on your own.
What have you done so far, not having dated anyone?
Well, I guess no man would stick around to put up with all your bad temper.
Ah, from now on, if you're grateful, say it to me personally.
Don't beat around the bush by saying it to a reporter.
Geez, that guy...
He really makes me not like him.
Does it hurt a lot?
Yes, it hurts crazily.
Is that wench crazy?
What face does she think she deals with... seriously...
Huh? Your cheek went in further, so your chin looks even longer.
No... Sung Min Ah, this fox-like wench!
By the way, Hyung.
What? I received the revised script, but its kiss scene seems even stronger now.
"... kisses her."
You said there is no kiss scene!
Get ready with the car.
Are you asking that because you don't know? So, when they said it would be revised, they meant that she's writing the kiss scene better.
With that moron?
"The number you called isn't available at the moment..." Then, about the funds he snuck out, are you saying you have no knowledge, Mr. Oh Jin Wan?
I had no knowledge of it. Sunbaenim, why don't you tell him the truth?
All that money, what did you do with that?
Chief Prosecutor wants you to call him.
Let's take a short break.
What on earth do you think you're doing now?
As if you don't know.
You would know well that I wouldn't die alone.
Where and when I used that money, do you want me to spill it all out?
Try it, then.
Because I've already got rid of all evidence of that money being used for lobbying.
And there is no evidence it was done by Chairman's instruction.
What we have are only the traces of transactions of all that money in your bank account.
Why on earth... do you hate me so much?
If this is because of all humiliation I've given you...
Humiliation...
You wouldn't know how it feels even if you came back from death. [dropping the honorifics]
As long as that moment, that memory remains in my brain, you...
I'm going to kill you.
Well, then, let's stop this cross-examination.
You can go back now.
Wait. Where do you think you're going?
Yes, please take good care of this case.
Arrested without a warrant?
Why is that all of a sudden?
That's why you should have minded your behaviors.
I asked you why!
Can't you tell just by looking at this?
You're in a serious bind right now.
Even if you had to part ways with him, you shouldn't have done that to your superior.
Hey, Kim Joo Yong!
Yes, what's going on?
Oh, end-of-the-year gathering? Well, actually, currently, at my district prosecutor's office, the representative of the production company of one of your dramas has been arrested without a warrant.
Who from our dramas?
"Morning in Kyeongseong," sounded like it's still going on.
"Morning of Kyeongseong"?
Is Representative Kim there?
Yes, but I don't think he'll be released easily.
Seems like there was an order from the higherups.
Someone must be behind all this.
She'd said she'd revise it... how dare she make a fool of me?
Hyung we're here.
Oh, why are you here?
Do you have to ask? So, let me get this straight, both of you have issues with the kissing scene in episode 7?
That's what makes it all the more tragic.
A kiss doesn't make it more tragic, though, To leave it as tragic, they should just stare at each other.
Which we can pull off well enough with our acting skills.
At any rate, change it like that.
Without the kiss.
After revising the previous draft because it was considered too bland, I can't do that.
Unni, do we not get a long? [dropping the honorifics]
I wouldn't say we don't. [Still uses honorifics]
What does the director say?
No matter what the director says, I can't do it.
No, I won't.
Don't change your word later.
We have to be persistent to the end.
Just make sure that you don't change your words.
I also have no desire to kiss you.
Well then, that's good. If I could avoid kissing that firefox,
I'd gladly swim in the ocean again! If I have to kiss that moron, I'd rather have my character shot dead so I can quit the drama.
So, Hyung, do you think Writer Lee will revise it?
After all, you did end up swimming in the ocean.
Moron
Alternative?
For example, we could make the revision ourselves and give it to her.
This one, this one, this one, this one! Take out "he kisses her," and change it to "Woojin gazes at her."
Well, that doesnt work with the flow of the movement from the earlier scene.
You also have to take out the "He grabs her hand and stops her from leaving."
Then, how is he going to gaze at her?
Just blankly?
Can't you pull it off with your acting skills?
Well, I have to see you to try acting.
Then, why don't we each fix our own parts.
Okay, fine. I got it. I'm hanging up.
Darn, that vixen.
Man, if she's going to do it anyway, why doesn't she fix mine, too...
Your revision of the kiss scene is great!
But, Representative Kim isn't here?
No. He left in the morning.
Nothing, just wondering why I couldn't reach him.
Let's not waste any more time here.
No matter what, you'll end up in prison.
Just fess up everything so that your sentence can get reduced at least, Mr. Stiff-Neck!
Man, what is he doing with his phone turned off all day?
Yes, Director, this is Writer Lee.
Could I see you for a moment?
"No matter what the director says, I can't do it?"
"No, I won't?"
No, that's not it, Director. That's...
I didn't know you were such a snitch, Writer Lee.
A snitch? Director... In the end, what you're saying is that you absolutely can't do the kiss scene.
That's correct. I'm really sorry, but I just can't do it, Director.
Yes, me too. Fine, if you have to have things your way, then I'll do things my way, too.
You know about my past, right?
If I say I quit, I do quit!
Once I drink this, I have no idea what might become of me.
Can you do it or not?
The taste of wine is dragging me back to alcoholism.
And you, Min Ah? I'll do it, but, I can't drink any alcohol, Director.
Then go and have a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow we have a full schedule ahead!
Ah, really how can you keep drinking?
You have a drink too.
Refreshing cassia seed tea is good for your health.
Cassia seed tea?
This really isn't alcohol.
Ah, you really shocked me!
This is what it means to be "seasoned."
It's good! Someone was so confident about not changing his mind, but I shouldn't have trusted someone's words.
Then what about you?
Who suggested it first?
You'd better brush your teeth properly (before filming the kiss scene).
Four times per day!
You'd better have your teeth scaled!
The Representative hasn't come back yet? Yes, his cell phone is still turned off, so I was worried and waiting for him, but now I'm about to go home.
He has never been like this before.
Ah, yes...
I'm sorry but there is no one named Kim Bong Dal in this company.
I'm sorry, but I guess you dialed the wrong number.
Hold on, PD Joo.
Hold on, please.
Hello, this is from Chamsomang Sanatorium.
Sanatorium?
Is there anyone named Kim Bong Dal?
Ah, if you tell me what you called for, I will leave the message for him.
I called because Mr. Kim Bong Dal's mother is in critical condition now.
Mo... His mother?
Yes. Please tell him he must come now.
Well, wait a moment, where is your sanatorium?
What is the reason you came to visit me?
Regarding the prosecutor's investigation about Representative Kim, which is currently happening, please halt it right away.
I didn't know that you cherished Anthony that much, Director Nam.
Stop trying to sabotage the production of "Morning of Kyeongseong," please!
How dare you order me to stop...
It has already been for 20 years that you didn't acknowledge me as your father, shutting me off.
But now, are you taking sides with that bastard who backstabbed your father?
Purged of the sin?
Then, do you think you're not guilty?
Please stop.
You... You're really capable, I guess. I don't know why, but it seems that the high authority has changed his mind.
The charges are dropped, and the case is wrapped up as if nothing happened.
Ah, yes, I'm really sorry to bother you for this.
Sometime soon, I'll arrange a meeting.
Let's have dinner together.
Ah, yes... Yes, then...
Let me ask you just one thing.
What is the reason you tried to protect that bastard?
Please let me tell you once again.
But you should know this one thing at least. That dirty trick you're talking about, you also had benefits from it.
How do you think you became Director, despite your lack of faction or connections?
What... what are you talking about?
That position was also given to you by your father's power, which you despise so much!
Anthony is released?
I heard that the case is closed now.
I think that Chairman ordered to drop the charges.
The Chairman?
It's me, Mr. Chairman.
I don't know what to say to express my gratitude.
You'd better thank Director Nam Woon Hyeong.
What brings you here at this late hour, Representative Kim?
I came to say thank you. Well, I don't know what you've heard or where, but I just did what I could do for my drama.
but I just did what I could do for my drama.
But can I ask you how you resolved it?
I don't think I have to tell you about that.
This afternoon, her condition suddely became critical.
But luckily, the critical moment is gone, and now she's stable.
So, you don't need to worry so much.
I didn't know your mother was still alive.
Why did you say it like that before?
That she had passed away.
I... really hated them.
Our extreme poverty, my father who abandoned me as soon as I was born, whose face I've never seen, and even my mother who is blind.
I hated them all and was ashamed of them.
When I got to the USA, I made a resolution.
That I will forget everything that happened in Korea. From now on, I'm Anthony, I don't know anything about poverty, and I grew up in the States, I'm Anthony.
And that's what I told everybody, too. That my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as inheritance.
That I grew up with a happy childhood.
I'm... a big coward.
What's the next scene?
Kim Woo Jin and Jin Hye Rin's kissing scene.
And the actors?
A kissing scene with that moron?
Just thinking about it makes me sick!
Min Ah, just close your eyes and get over with it, please?
What else can we do at this point?
Do you really have to go that far?
Affawhashiditamelashtime?
(After what she did to me last time?
Afcarshahaftagothishfar.
(Of course I have to go this far.)
Afcarsh.
(Of course.)
If you are ready, you may come out.
From now on, can you play the piano only for me?
Even if I were to betray you?
Even if I were to deceive you?
Could you still play it only for me?
Ah, Min Ah, what's wrong?
You were doing so well!
Go brush your teeth before I throw a fit. [Dropping the honorifics]
Yes, Noona.
"Is there anyone that came to your mind first or that you are most grateful for?"
"Of course, it's my mom. Mrs. Park Kang Ja."
Of course, of course it's your mom.
Who else but your mom?
By the way, mom...
There is someone I know... whose past is so full of pain that he can't get over it...
Sure, there are people like that.
He wanted to forget about his past so much so that he said his mother had passed away even though she's alive.
Does that make him a bad person?
Of course that makes him a bad person.
Then why the heck would someone not think of him as a bad person?
Well, that means that someone likes that person.
Is this about you?
It's for my drama.
So cold. Aunty, I've come for some grilled mackerels!
And that's what I told other people, too.
That my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as inheritance. That I grew up with a happy childhood.
I'm... a big coward...
I couldn't reach you at all all day yesterday.
You did that back then, too.
Five years ago, when you broke up with me and left.
I've told you already.
I've erased all my memories of you.
Though you may not have had started out that way, towards the end, you ended up loving me.
Yes, I admit that I did like you.
Then, why did you leave?
You're an actress who should be loved by everybody. If that's the only reason, don't leave me ever again.
Episode 14 From Dusk till Dawn Ready, action! FIRE!
Hye Rin! Ahjussi,youcan'tsleephere ! FIRE!
Cut! Hyun Min, what's wrong? Director!
There's someone inside!
I SAID THERE'S SOMEONE INSIDE!
Eariler there was an extra inside, maybe he wasn't feeling well.
Ahjussi!
That Ahjussi earlier with the carrier.
The Ahjussi I replaced, I don't see him anywhere.
The fire truck?
It should... arrive soon.
No, Representative!
Ahjussi, are you alright?
Come to your senses! Wake up!
We have to get out!
Get on my back!
No, director, you can't!
People getting hurt at my set...
I can't just stand around and watch!
We should worry about that person.
What's with all of you?
Like people who were wishing that I wouldn't get out.
Don't tell me... You weren't crying, right?
What crying?
All the smoke is blowing in my direction, it's killing my eyes.
Representative, are you okay?
What about the other person?
They're doing first aid for now, his condition seems to be rather severe.
How is his blood pressure?
Move him to intensive care!
Where is the hospital?
I have to go there as well.
The director said the actors and staff shouldn't come.
and just stand by near here.
He will contact us.
The extra who died on my set on that day, 5 years ago...
That day comes up again and again in my memory.
Bring my son back to life!
I'm telling you to bring him back!
My precious son!
Bring him back...
For now, don't look for me.
Thenwhataboutmydrama?
Now my drama is finished.
Hm, Mom.
Did the staff like it?
They all said it's really delicious and complimented your cooking skills.
And were really grateful.
Yes? But why does your voice sound so frail?
But why does your voice sound so frail?
Work is going well, so don't worry too much.
Don't get too hung up on the script without sleping, and take it easy.
Don't overwork.
Yes, I'll do that.
Mom, I'll give you a call later on.
I was worried...
He just went into intensive care, we're all waiting for him to wake up.
Actually, I was surprised. I'm sorry to you for thinking this way, but that you would come here yourself,
I would never have imagined it.
It's what I should do.
You must be tired, you can go and wash up.
You don't have to worry because I'm here.
Writer!
I... saw him. No, no, no.
Bit Na... She's the lead actress, so I have to act with her.
How can we film seperately?
Anyways, I'm a little busy so I'll call you later.
What a scare!
Hey, Bit Na, if you're going to be like this I'm going to get mad!
Back then, if I... had only woken him up...
If I had called another person... it wouldn't have turned out like that.
Don't blame yourself too much.
You couldn't have imagined the situation would be like this.
No one could.
Even so... If only I had given it a little thought this wouldn't have happen.
I fully understand what you're feeling.
Don't think about it this negatively.
Because that man can get up again.
Of course. Everyone is praying single-heartedly, so it will turn out well.
So cheer up. Kang Hyun Min style.
My style?
Korea's top star Kang Hyun Min, Your Highness' style.
Yes, like Brad Pitt.
He said he came because he was worried.
Externally he has minor burns, the problem are internal injuries of the lung.
Fotunately the internal injuries are also minor.
Go inside, have a look.
He regained consciousness a while ago.
Are you feeling alright?
Thank you so much, Representative.
If it wasn't for you...
I wouldn't have remained alive.
Get well fast.
Once this drama is finished, you have to do the ninth drama with us as well.
Then. I'll have to get up fast.
Min Ah!
They said he's conscious!
He woke up?
Yes, and there are no major injuries.
Ah... That such a relief.
I'll be at the car.
Take your time to get ready and come out.
Okay, got it.
Representative, no!
All the smoke is blowing in my directions, it's killing my eyes.
Representative! - Ah, Team Leader.
Give him enough money for him to get proper treatment until he fully recovers.
Also quickly prepare the compensation so he can receive it soon.
Make sure it to be enough, not lacking.
Yes, I got it. Make sure it to be enough, not lacking.
Ah, nothing.
Representative, today... you were totally cool.
Representative, are you alright?
Shouldn't you be examined as well?
You don't look good.
How can I look good?
I went into a fire pit and came out.
I'm okay, so don't worry.
Now did those 5-year-old memories disperse a little?
You're a pretty okay producer.
It took you this long to realize that?
How disappointing.
Now you'd better get back to the set and finish the shoot.
Isn't it the last scene?
Please look after the situation over here.
Hyun Min, let's go!
Don't we have to shoot the last scene? Of course we have to shoot it!
That little bastard Kang Hyun Min has changed quite a lot.
He did, didn't he?
But it's not as much as the change of "someone".
I'm talking about "someone" who was the original cold-blooded asshole but now suddenly changed to a nice guy.
Why did you run into the fire?
Everybody was at a loss, not knowing what to do, but why did you run into the fire despite its danger?
I just went inside.
Didn't you say you sold your soul to the devil?
The soul Anthony sold - Kim Bong Dal bought it back, cheaply.
So you have returned.
We're done for tonight!
Well, today, you all did a great job.
Tomorrow there is no shoot, so rest well.
Let's get back to Seoul!
I can't do that, Director. On a good day like today let's have a get-together!
Everyone, today's get-together is on Kang Hyun Min!
This is for the staff. Don't eat it.
I'm staff, too.
You punk, get to cooking'.
The meat is done.
Enjoy your meal.
This is also sponsored, isn't it?
No, it isn't. I'm paying for it all.
So, the meat is done. The hero of today who made sure that we can continue shooting in safety is our Representative Kim. Let's hear from him!
Be cool and say a word.
All of you, who worked hard in this cold weather. All of you, who worked hard in this cold weather.
Somebody said this.
"If you're worried, you will lose, but if you're excited, you will win."
In the future, I wish that the hearts of all of us are filled with all memories of excitement (of this drama).
Here, Cheers!
A man's life is usually lonely.
World production of "Morning of Kyeongseong" who are working hard for filming, are you ready, World Production?
["I'm a man." by Kim Jang Hoon]
♫ You might not know this, but I loved you.♫
♫ I apologize for pretending like a cold-hearted man. ♫
♫ When I let you go for the reason that I'm a man, ♫
♫ I prayed for you to be happy, like a fool. ♫
Creamy skin, Kang Hyun Min!
I love you, Kang Hyun Min!
♫ Only the glass of strong soju is consoling me. ♫
♫ On my lips which used to kiss you with closed eyes, ♫
♫ I'm putting a cigarette instead, lost in memories with you. ♫ ♫ Oh, wind, please rise. ♫
♫ All those words I couldn't tell. ♫
♫ If you meet her, ♫
♫ Will you tell her for me?
♫ I love you, Kang Hyun Min! Creamy skin, Kang Hyun Min!
How was it, Kwang Soo!
Chil Goo Hyung!
♫ GOOD BYE~!
Now, wishing for the rating in 50%!
Everyone, you've worked very hard.
Thank you! Well, then, keeping up this great mood, let's move on to the second round at each room.
Please bring your own glass.
Everyone, let's move!
- AARGH! ("007 Bang" : a kind of drinking game)
What is this....
One Shot!
Ah, this damn popularity...
I won't do this again.
0!
7!
- Bang! - AARGH!
I'm about to piss...
You're weak, but why are you carrying such heavy stuffs?
Give it to me, I'll do it!
You don't have to help me.
Kwang Soo, you're going to drive tomorrow, so you'd better get full rest.
No, PD Joo, I slept a lot earlier.
Then, why don't you two do it together?
Hey, here, one shot.
One shot!
Don't you think this is too much?
It's like saturation bombing!
Then, you just need to not be caught.
You're good!
Wow, indeed, you're the king of drinking.
Okay, I'm done!
No more!
Hey, how could you just leave?
Ah, this damn popularity!
It's always "to be continued", even during the team dinner.
- 0.
- 7! - Bang!
- Aargh!
I got you!
Gwangsoo!
He's sure having fun. But...
I can take care of the actors.. but Representative Kim you have to take care of Writer Lee.
Actually, among all, Writer Lee is the one who should take care of her health the most.
If you get sick, it will cause the blank of scripts right away.
Well, we were going to leave the room soon, anyway.
What's with this atmosphere, so awkwardly quiet?
Should Kang Hyun Min up the mood?
What would be good?
What about Ya Ja Time?
What a stupid game, Ya Ja Time. Anthony, be quiet. (Informally)
Are we starting?
Hyun Min, you, stop acting up like that. (informally)
Hey, Min Ah, you think I'll let you off easy because you're the nuna?
Nuna (an older sister) my ass...
How much longer are you going to pretend to be 27?
Be honest.
You're 31.
Stop staring, dude.
Okay okay... let's end it here.
Young Mok, you be quiet. The adults are talking.
Oh, Representative Kim.
The incident was taken care of?
Yes, thankfully everyone is safe and sound.
Please tell that to the Chief.
Umm, that is..
Chief Nam handed in his resignation.
His resignation?
Well, it hasn't been processed yet.
We can talk details when you're back in Seoul.
Oh really, then... Ah, it's been a long time, this is great.
Well, did you finish your business refreshingly (at the restroom), Director?
Now, I'm not a Director any longer. Hey, stop talking formally.
We got hired at the same time.
Geez. Yes, I understood, Director.
You... Come back again.
Hey, I just submitted my resignation.
The president hasn't approved it yet.
You know what kind of a person Deputy Director Kim is.
As soon as you you submitted your resignation, he's already so busy to put his people in the important positions.
Do you think that's all? All the dramas with great quality, which you gave the time slots, they are all cancelled now.
Woon Hyeong, I'm begging you. To Drama Department, please come back.
What are you thinking so hard about?
No, it's nothing.
By the way...
Why did you really run in?
You were the kind of person who worked on the principle of certainty based on numbers.
I'm just curious if you had such confidence when you ran into the fire.
Seriously, why did you run in?
Someone pushed me from behind.
Honestly, I don't know either.
Why I did that in that moment.
I want to know.
The more I know you, the better I want to get to know you.
I am Brad Pitt.
Oh, Bit Na It'll be hard to see you today. I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
That person who got hurt is fine now.
You have to throw a party for him too?
Even so a person I work with came back from the dead.
What am I supposed to do.
So... now you're saying that ajusshi is more important than I am?
That's not what I'm saying.
You're saying you can't come because some nobody extra got hurt.
Some nobody extra?
Am I wrong?
How can you say something like that?
So RUDELY?
Oppa, are you... mad at me right now?
Be honest, right now you're drinking and playing with that bitch Sung Min Ah.
I'm playing with Sung Min Ah.
I want to play with Sung Min Ah. All night long!
Do you like that bitch?
YES I LOVE SUNG MIN AH, I LOVE HER VERY MUCH, I LOVE HER SO VERY MUCH!
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH SUNG MIN AH!
HANGING UP!
Don't take this wrong.
I might look crazy now, but ...
Don't come any closer!
That's not it-
I said don't come any closer!
No, I mean...
Find someone within your league.
- Good Morning!
- Have you slept well?
Representative isn't here?
Ah, he had to go to Seoul.
Ah... riding on that food truck?
I wonder if he's doing ok with the trip.
Oh, you're here.
Writer Lee, let's go together in my car.
It's raining all of a sudden.
This is the first time I've ridden in a car with a writer like this.
Ah, you said before, that you and Representative Kim are like an angel and a demon.
Ah, before...
What happened so that he's called as a demon-like bad producer?
I'm just curious if he was different (to you) from Representative Kim whom I know.
Frankly speaking, I like Representative Kim.
No, I mean, two of us used to love each other, so we're trying to work it out from now on.
I'm hoping you, Writer Lee, can help our relationship.
You can tell Represenative Kim is a really great guy as soon as you see him.
All of you, aren't you embarrassed to bring me this rating chart?
CP Choi of the daily drama.
Yes, Deputy Director.
Why do you think your rating is bad?
Why is such bad ratings happening?
And, "Children of Paradise", make it end within this month. It's quality is good and the reaction from viewers is getting better.
It's quality is good and the reaction from viewers is getting better.
Quality, potential... Do you think such things will bring more advertisement?
Until when will you wait for the bit-by-bit increasing rating?
The next drama after "Children of Paradise"...
Where is CP Oh?
Oh, CP Oh!
Don't make some trivial one, but something sensational, something stunning! Yes.
Listen carefully!
I care about only rating.
Rating, rating, rating!
Do properly, please!
Shall we buy a dog, too?
No way. I really hate dogs.
We love dogs a lot.
- Then, who will take care of it?
You must be coming back from grocery shopping.
You should say hello. Hello!
Oh this kid.
You look a lot like your dad, huh?
But, Who are you Ahjussi?
Ah, someone dad works with.
Go in, first.
I'm sure you've heard the news, and I have nothing to say to you.
Please, just leave.
Were you somebody who feels so little responsibility?
Well, is that good enough to be a reason? and I found that out later.
Well, is that good enough to be a reason?
Nam Gook Hyeon, Chairman of Empire Group.
I got the position because of my father's power.
Maybe, that's why I hated you more, Representative Kim.
To me, you seemed worse than my father.
I wanted to deny such father, so I have lived, thinking I don't have a father.
I wanted to hide it until the end if I could.
Well, then that's enough for the reason, isn't it?
If that is why (you resigned), it can't be a reason to me even more.
I also had a family whom I wanted to deny once.
But even so, I didn't run away from the path I had to go.
You once told me that people like me should disappear from this field.
But in the end, I'm still here, but you're leaving.
Before you leave, just keep this in your mind.
Then, at the end, there will be only dirty people left with shady tricks.
Now Hyun Min, pass the thugs sent by Choi, look towards Min Ah.
Hyun Min's face is full of surprise!
That's right, that's right!
Good! Still in shock, Hyun Min's line!
Hyun Min, what about your line?
I'm done with you!
Have your way with the shooting snogging your oh-so-beloved Sung Min Ah!
Um, isn't she... Yoon Bit Na of the idol group Angels? Yoon Bit Na of the idol group Angels?
(moron)
Let's take a break for 5 minutes.
- Gwang Soo. - Yes, Hyung.
Why didn't you block her? Even if I had blocked her, you'd still have gotten slapped.
So unlucky!
To be honest, I like Representative Kim.
To be more specific, we used to be in love with each other.
And now, we're trying to get back together.
I'm hoping that you, Writer Lee, could help us with that.
Once you get to know him, Representative Kim is quite a catch.
What do you mean "why"?
What do you mean "what"?
You said you were going to re-sign your contract.
That's why you're calling right now?
Is there anything to talk about besides that?
Looks lire you're at your studio, so I'll head that way.
No, don't come.
I said don't come, since I'm going out now.
Do I have to report that to you too?
You're here!
He's been waiting!
Why are you so late?
I heard that you're going to sign a contract for 100 episodes.
He's also promising a lot of money!
Well, I'll leave you two to talk.
I'll run some errands next door.
How did you know to come here?
Besides the writer's room, do you have anywhere else to go but here?
Okay, let's make this contract, Writer Lee.
Did that SSD Production Company or whatever contact you again?
How much did they offer you?
Do you think I'm doing this because of money?
Then what is it?
Don't forget how much I had to suffer in that bitter cold because of you.
No... I - I need to read and review the contract, don't I?
You can't take your word back, alright?
Alright, I got it!
Don't let me wait too long. Hyung, Hyung, Hyung, Hyung, Wake up.
[Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah are actually in love with each other]
Gwang Soo, how did this happen?
I guess one of the staff members who were there at the set that day must have informed the reporters.
The day when you got slapped by Miss Yoon Bit Na.
I'm done with you now!
Have it your way with the shooting snogging that oh-so-beloved Sung Min Ah!
Oh my mother, father... Unni, does this even make sense?
Min Ah, you should calm down first. Calm down, calm down.
I think Kang Hyun Min released these articles on purpose.
He did it because I wasn't accepting his heart.
Would he go that far?
A moron like him would easily do this!
Unni, you have no idea how much he is into me right now.
That bad?
What the heck is Representative Oh doing, letting these kind of reports get published?
I know, right?
Really!
Representative, Miss Sung Min Ah is in a scandal in the reports!
Well, it's...
Is it Anthony?
What the heck is this? What the heck is this?
The report on Miss Sung Min Ah's scandal.
What the heck?
Since when did they get so close?
No wonder...
I knew it the moment Yoon Bit Na of Angels slapped him.
Slapped him?
Come on, spill it!
We have no time to lose! Well, you should take a look at this.
[Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah are actually in love with each other according to a MiK staff]
Representative, were you aware of it, too?
What would you like to have?
Hot Jamaican Blue with extra shot.
Espresso.
What the heck are you doing?
I know very well that you released those reports!
Take those reports off while I'm still being civil.
(informally)
What did you say just now?
Yes, you!
Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah, you both look so great together.
I wish you to continue loving each other in a bashing manner, fighting.
Why are you sitting here?
Oh my Jesus.. Oh my Jesus..
Have you read that scandal news about Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah?
People will now watch the drama with more interests.
It will help the rating, don't you think so?
"Children of Paradise", I think I told you to end it earlier than its original plan. Well, that's...
In case of "Children of Paradise", both the production company and its actors are so determined to work for it until the end.
Moreover, if it ends earlier, the next drama's first airdate should be moved up, but its production company is complaining a lot because they're not ready yet.
Production company, production company, PRODUCTION COMPANY!
What can you do if you keep kissing the asses of production companies!
?
Yes, that's right. Scheduling the dramas is the own right of us, the broadcasting station, but at the same time, it's the promise with viewers.
Yes, I just met President.
As of 5 PM, today, I'm approved to come back as Director of Drama Department.
Deputy Director.
Thank you for your work. First, for leaving my position because of my personal reason,
Then, before starting the meeting, let me tell you one thing. That's right, as our Deputy Director Kim said, we're the "A".
But I would appreciate if you remember this point as well.
Justice without power is really helpless and vain.
But power without justice is just violence.
Now, the era of violence must be ended.
The era of violence must not be repeated.
Well, then shall we begin the meeting?
I heard there was some hiccup on the shooting schedule because of the fire accident. I heard there was some hiccup on the shooting schedule because of the fire accident.
Wouldn't there be any problem for our air schedule?
I don't think it's something a jobless person has to concern. Listen well,
I'm talking to you now as Director of Drama Department.
Yes, I understand, Director. Everything will go well without any issue.
Okay, I will rely on you, Representative Kim.
I heard you're reinstated.
As you see.
What is the reason you changed your mind?
Well, if you hear that, you will be disappointed.
Well, there is nothing more to be disappointed about.
Yes. This position, that's right, not by my competence but by your power, Father, by unjust method, it's given to me.
Even if I didn't know that, it's also my fault.
I thought that is very important.
Well, times have changed, I guess.
I will keep watching whether you would change or the world would change.
Let's think about warm things.
For me, it's baked sweet potatoes.
The first thing coming in your mind is that cheap baked sweet potato?
What's wrong with baked sweet potatoes?
If you're not careful enough, your mouth will get burnt.
You have to blow on them as you eat since they are so hot.
Miss, would you like a sweet potato?
No thank you, I'm fine.
Please keep selling many.
No. No, Lee Go Eun.
Don't think useless thoughts.
Concentrate on the script.
Concentrate for the waiting viewers of your drama.
Okay, you can do it! Aja aja! Lee Go Eun, FIGHTING!
What are you doing, not opening the door?
Have you made a decision?
What decision?
Renewing the contract.
Is that why you came?
Because of this. No. Because of this.
You said you wanted to eat roasted sweet potatoes.
You don't remember that night?
You said while shivering that you wanted to eat sweet potatoes.
I didn't do this because of the contract renewal and I didn't do it for some other ulterior motive either.
Honestly, I just bought them when I saw the street vendor selling them nearby, so just enjoy.
Eat it before it gets cold. I'm leaving.
I don't even believe in myself sometimes but I believe in you.
You're not... crying, right?
No, the two of us, we used to love each other, and now, we're thinking of working it out.
Do they taste bad?
Why do you confuse people?
You're dating Sung Min Ah, why are you being like this to me?
Dating Sung Min Ah?
What do you mean, "who"?
You are.
Why would that person give me sweet potatoes?
Who said I was dating Sung Min Ah?
I don't know where you heard that strange rumor no, I guess you're saying that because you saw me with Sung Min Ah here before.
I don't have such feelings for whomever, so you don't have to be concerned.
Well, it's not that I'm concern about that but...
That is... And, if somebody buys you sweet potato, are you always confused?
What are you confused about?
Well, this... if this is from China or from domestic... I was confused...
That is... Do you by chance like me?
Then again, that would never happen.
Episode 15 We have crossed the Rubicon Do you like me by any chance? But then, there is no way you would.
Representative. What? N--No, it's nothing.
So silly. Right! I like you!
I said I like you.
I must be crazy, I'm crazy.
I'm not in my right mind.
I like you!
Hyung, what are you waiting for?
Just tell her like a man!
I just can't work up the courage.
That's why you need to get brave.
Just make up your mind and walk up to her...
Walk up to what?
PD Joo, what is it?
No, nothing.
Actually, Joo PD...
Spill it, Goo Hee Jae.
What is it? PD Joo fell in love.
What?
Love?
Yes. The moment he saw the youngest FD of the directing team, he fell for her.
Joo PD.
Are you in your right mind?
Do you think I pay you just so you could chase chicks at the filming site?
What kind of a production PD doesn't separate his private life from his work?
Are you really dating Kang Hyun Min?
I don't know about it.
If you really want to know, you could go ask that moron yourself.
I need to go for more shooting. Min Ah, either Anthony or Kang Hyun Min, the way I see it, your taste in men is really low.
You know it. Our Hyun Min is so gentle and considerate, which could cause such rumors with Miss Sung Min Ah, but... Hyung, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Representative Choi! Red long johns, red pants!
What'cha doin'?
- Just shut up already!
Ah, at any rate, they're not in a relationship at all.
Yes, then, I'm hanging up.
I was just explaining to the reporter about your rumor!
Ah, you were being interviewed?
Yes. You should have said so then.
How can you hang up so rudely when it was such an important call?
They're only going to get more suspicious!
What exactly do you do for me as my representative?
Do you even know that my Korean beef endorsement contract is about to expire?
Don't worry, they're coming this afternoon.
I'm out of your league, so give up and just concentrate on your drama.
Ah well, with your unrequited love and endorsements... you're busider than a bee, no wonder you'd forget about the drama.
Unrequited love?
Busier than a bee?
Is there a bee farm around here?
Why did it fail?
Hey! Isn't "Morning in Kyeongseong" a total hit?
Hyun Min Oppa is so amazing in that one!
But, I'm not sure about the recent episodes.
Why?
Think about it. Jin Hye Rin told Kim Woo Jin that she loves him and whatever.
They even kissed!
And now she's going to betray him?
What's up with that?
That doesn't make sense.
Roasted sweet potatoes, chips, ramyun...
Such a childish appetite you have.
Don't you care about staying in shape?
Your mother is at your studio, so get going.
Aigoo, it already started!
You're watching it again?
Of course! I'm watching all the reruns, too.
Is it that fun?
Whose daughter wrote it, after all?
Gosh, why is he like that again?
Go Eun... That Jin Hye Rin, is she betraying Kim Woo Jin after all?
Actually, this will be revealed much later, but she's not really betraying him.
She's pretending to betray him because there's no other way, but she's really helping Kim Woo Jin.
Oh, it was like that?
Had I known that, I wouldn't have been cursing her.
My daughter is amazing!
You are a genius, genius!
Why, what are you doing?
Representative Choi! - Just shut up already!
Your voice came out also.
How embarrassing...
Ah, seriously!
Celebrity couple in the making?
I told them no! Why don't they believe me?
! That's why you should have been more firm!
My CF, my money is here!
I've been really enjoying "Morning in Kyeongseong" lately. Ah, speaking of which,
How about doing it with Miss Sung Min Ah this time as a couple?
Judging from the drama, the two of you really look great and work well together.
I've been doing this by myself for 3 years, why would I do it with Sung Min Ah now?
Well, it is the wish of the sponsor.
Send the sponsor my message clearly: Either I, Kang Hyun Min, do it by myself,
He will never be able to do it with someone else.
I won't do it!
Oh, you know, right?
That scandal... is total nonsense.
Of course, I know it better than anybody.
Did you want to see me to talk about that?
No. There is someone I'd like you to meet.
Ah, there he comes.
Say hello to the Chief Director of Taesan Group, Kim Sang Jik.
I'm Anthony Kim.
A production company?
Our company is going to create the largest production company in Asia.
We would like you to be the CEO of that company.
We'll offer you the highest salary in the industry as well as 10% of the shares.
I'm sorry, but I will decline.
Are you passing up this exceptional offer? Of course, it is an attractive offer, but However, I don't want to work under other people any more.
In thinking about our entertainment group, it's not only into drama but includes management.
This first management contract will be with Sung Min Ah.
If you confirm, then we will move immediately.
You said that you wanted to make the world's best production, right?
Why don't you make it, starting from here?
Every year, I will invest $40 million into World Production.
Of course, the owner will be Anthony Kim.
As long as we get 49% of the shares.
What do you think? This offer?
I will accept. You have made the right decision!
We will complete the operating details and
I will take it as a confirmed contract.
You are finally able to achieve your dream. Watching you succeed, while watching you, is also the dream that I hoped for.
♫ Because your two eyes are far away, I only see you.
The person who created Empire's myth is exactly you, Anthony, is it not?
You said that you wanted to make Asia's best production did you not?
Why don't you go ahead and try making it?
Of course, the owner is you, Anthony Kim.
Bong Dal Representative, it's me.
I'm in the middle of a meeting. I'm busy, so hang up.
From this moment on, I will start my own drama again.
I think I said that I was in the middle of a meeting.
I'm busy, so hang up.
If you hang up this time, I'm not going to leave you be.
What are taking my word for?
I'm busy right now but because of you....
You said you were a busy person.
You said you were in the middle of a meeting.
Exactly what kind of person has a meeting by himself on his deck?
Until a few moments ago, I was busy with the meeting.
But what are you trying to say?
By tomorrow morning, please gather the "Morning in Kyeongseong's" crew.
Gather?
It's something more important than anything.
So, you're going to fix the uploaded episodes 11 and 12?
Yes, I wanted to show more of the love between the two characters.
Up to now, only in Episode 13, it is realized that Hye Rin came to help Woo Jin.
And then, it was my idea that Hye Rin's character would be seen as nearly sinister.
Because trying to make it too much a film noir was the wrong choice.
So you will modify episode 11 by accelerating the content of episode 13?
Yes. With that change, I think it will be possible to see the audience rooting for the two characters.
But, can you amend the screenplay in less than four days?
It's not something to be dealt with by talking. You have a point there to put the story together, but it's a big risk.
If that is to happen, we will have to be shooting live straight through the week before.
Hyun Min, what do you think?
Do it like that.
She says she can do it, so why don't we try believing Writer Lee?
Is it not unimagineable, too difficult and are there problems every day?
Can you really do the script in four days?
Yes. I can do it.
Fine. If Writer Lee says she can do it, then I will wait.
Then, take care of yourself.
Let's see how well you can do.
The writer says she can do it, so why don't we trust her once?
I mean, that's living.
That fox!
We're in a state of emergency now.
I know. Even if you manage to rewrite the script for 2 episodes, what comes after that is the problem.
For the following episodes, even if there is a problem in the script, we still have to shoot it without changing a thing.
I'm fully aware of it.
You have to keep this in mind, that the decision you just made, put "Morning in Kyeongseong" on a path of no return.
Like Julius Caesar who marched toward Rome in B.C. 49, we have crossed the Rubicon River.
Let them find out at this point... and make a powerful ending...
It's unlocked. Since we're in a state of emergency, we have to save the time for sleep as well as food.
Naturally, until you're done with the revision, you can't leave the studio.
So, what are all these? Multivitamins, Red Ginseng extract, Omega-3 for improving circulation, and this is yogurt, good for constipation.
If you're sitting in one place too long, you get constipated.
Since your physical health is top priority, make sure to take them.
And what is that? Toothpaste, shampoo, and lotion.
Also, since I don't know what you use, I just bought one of each kind.
Why, you don't use the ones with wings?
I bought them because they cost 1500 won more.
You're a man, Representative.
Isn't it weird for a man to buy these for a woman?
I'm not a man, but a producer. You're not a woman, but a writer.
I'll put these away and sit here, so call me if you need anything.
What?
Why would I leave?
You're not Writer Kim Soo Hyun.
What, are you sleepy already?
Then, we will meet next week and discuss.
Make an appointment with the production company, please.
Yes, yes, good work.
By the way, Director...
There's barely enough time for shooting, how can they revise the script now? How about this, hiring a more experienced writer to help Writer Lee Go Eun...
Why don't we trust Writer Lee Go Eun and wait? Seriously, Director, she's a rookie, how can we just trust and wait?
Why, didn't you call her another Writer Kim Soo Hyun?
Well, that..
after continuing 10 more years..
Listen, Director Lee...
Just... Just, just...
Uh, Director.
What do we do Hyun Min?
Why? What's the problem?
I just heard from the Korean beef commercial.
Tthe sponsor says, if you don't do it with Sung Min Ah, he'd choose another couple.
!
Like who? I guess they're trying to contact Jang Dong Gun and Go So Young.
Jang Dong Gun and Go So Young?
(A married couple of superstars)
Miss Sung Min Ah...
I think I warned you, not to stare at me.
Let's talk for a moment.
I don't have anything to talk about with you.
It's only for a moment.
It's a very important thing.
So, let me get this straight.
you want us to be in a Korean beef commercial as a couple?
I'm not interested. Look for someone else.
I don't want to be in a commercial with you, Miss Sung Min Ah.
Then why are you asking to do it together?
Well, you could call it the responsibility of the leading actor...
Besides, why are you so selfish, Miss Sung Min Ah?
When Writer Lee is working so hard, are you just going to sit there and do nothing?
When we do a commercial as a couple, it will also promote more awareness of our drama... Stop that nonsense, and tell me the real reason.
Ah man, really...
Can't you just do it this once?
I'll do anything you ask.
Fine, but I have one condition.
Do a TV interview in person, Mr. Kang Hyun Min, that we're not in a relationship.
Also, release news reports to clarify the rumors.
Just make sure to clean up this whole mess about us.
Can you promise to do that?
Deal.
Then, me too.
Deal!
Do you think this makes sense?
Why doesn't it?
Kim Woo Jin gives up his lifelong dream and goes to rescue Jin Hye Rin?
What a nonsense!
He loves her that much! Of course he'd rush to save Jin Hye Rin, leaving everything behind.
What idiot gives up his dream for love?
If he loves her to death, why wouldn't he? In case you haven't noticed, humans are innately selfish.
In case you haven't noticed, humans are innately selfish.
They cry when they're hungry, and they smile when they're full.
Have you ever been in love at all? Have you ever been in love at all? Have you ever been in love at all?
How can you not understand this?
Unlike your elementary unrequited crushes, I have had lots of experience.
How many? Like what?
Kissing and sleeping together.
You mean, doing those is love?
What else is there to it?
Uh, so low!
Yes, I'm a third-rate lowlife.
But you don't even have that experience.
Ah, whatever.
I got it. Let's stop this conversation now.
I'll just write the script. I'll just write the script.
Sure, you write the script.
I'll make a trip to the office.
You still seem to think that you're right.
But admit it, you're wrong.
Just go already!
Your son looks really amazing.
Producing a great drama like that.
You must be really proud of him.
He should find a good woman before I pass on.
He's not married yet?
I even wonder if he ever liked someone?
Because of the hardships he had to endure, he only knows to pretend to be strong.
He doesn't know how to open up his heart to someone.
If he had been born to good parents, he could have had a happy life... What are you doing, not writing the script?
It's a movie I must watch for the script.
Love Letter?
Yes, I've watched it about 100 times now.
Why would you watch it again then?
Well, to get into the emotional mood, I have to watch it even for 101st time!
It's all because you've never been in love that you're watching something like this.
Stop nagging like that.
I'm going to watch it anyway.
Are you doing well?
I'm doing fine!
You're supposed to make others cry, not cry yourself.
Are you doing well?
(In Japanese) Are you doing well?
Is that sad?
Please stop crying so ugly.
You're disturbing the person next to you.
It's sad but really beautiful, right?
About what? After a long time has passed, she finally sees the letter the man had left in the book.
Even the title of the book is "In search of lost time."
I read that book so many times even...
I mean it. You were never in true love, Representative.
Because my eyes are blinded, all I see is you, because my heart is frozen,
I wrap my arms around you.
When your trembling lips get closer to my ears, Anthony, are you crazy?
This is nonsense.
How can that tomboy look so pretty in my eyes?
Are the terms of the contract ok?
- Both Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah agree... so I don't think it'll be a problem.
Don't we need to hear what Writer Lee Go Eun thinks?
Shall we call her?
Well then, Representative...
Um, Representative?
Oh, what did you say?
Ah, so cold.
It's too cold!
It wakes me right up!
Yes, Chief Director.
I'm calling because the chairman would like to meet you in person and discuss the contract.
How about Friday evening?
That's fine. I'll see you then.
Alright, we'll decide on the time and place and contact you again.
Yes, good bye.
The door is open, what are... Wait, why am I doing this?
Stop this, Anthony. I'm a producer, and she's a writer.
I guess the others haven't come in yet?
Here's the revised draft of the script.
The revised draft makes it so much easier to empathize!
The starting point isn't too bad. PD Joo, what are you doing? !
What is the viewership rating for today?
19.8%.
It went up 2.1% from the day before!
Ah, good job everyone.
"Morning in Kyeongseong" soars even higher as the truth behind Jin Hye Rin's betrayal is revealed
"Morning in Kyeongseong" leads the viewership rating for 6 weeks in a row, going over 20%
As the romance of Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah develop, "Morning in Kyeongseong" keeps its lead.
Lately, the viewership rating has been soaring up impressively.
Well, I don't concern myself too much over the viewership ratings.
The only thing that I'm interested in is the love from you.
Today, we'd like to hear the truth.
The rumor with Miss Sung Min Ah, is it really just a rumor?
Today, until you give us an answer about the rumor, I won't let you go.
Ah, just answer him, you moron!
Miss Sung Min Ah, right.
She's a great actress.
She's a good actor and a good person. I can swear over my family, sadly, it is only a rumor.
We're not dating.
You're not dating.
However, you may count on the Kim Woo Jin that is acting with Miss Sung Min Ah. The promise made with my pride as an actor at stake,
I must keep for sure.
Ensure the health of the hubby with Korean beef?
Newlywed couple style?
More like an arranged marriage.
Today's shooting is about a newlywed couple.
Did you get a botox shot?
Well, you look somewhat different.
Chu~?
Take care of your husband's physical health with Korean beef.
Korean beef!
I just visited Hoengseong recently.
[Hoengseong: famous town for Korean beef]
I count on you to promote more awareness about Korean beef.
What's with that face?
You got money and Korean beef!
Isn't this awesome?
Ah, what a pathetic bum.
Pathetic bum?
Do you think I'm just doing this for the money? Even Anthony and Writer Lee, for the drama, are working on the script together.
Then we, also for the drama, could shoot commercials and promote our drama!
They're working on the script together?
Didn't you know? All day long, they're stuck together like this, working on the script, I think.
I told you not to skip the supplements.
You caught a cold because you're not physically fit.
Thirty minutes after a meal.
I'll make sure to take them this time.
You grow on me.
My studio isn't that far.
I can just walk...
It's because I'm cold.
It's me, Min Ah.
(Wait over there for a moment)
Are you busy?
Well, busy as usual.
Then, can you get out for a moment?
I have something to tell you, and I'm free this evening.
I'll see you then.
We're going to relocate our office.
The office?
Yes, to a much bigger place.
Is it something Miss Sung Min Ah helped you with?
She introduced me to a company that wants to invest in our shares.
Yes. Once the contract goes smoothly tomorrow, I'll get you a new studio with a better view, so you can prepare for the next project.
With Sung Min Ah as the lead.
With Miss Sung Min Ah as the lead actress?
That was their condition.
So stop beating around the bush and putting off your contract renewal, and let's renew your contract.
It couldn't have been easy for a rookie writer to change the course of the storyline in the middle.
You must have really helped her a lot, Representative.
Of course. She couldn't have come this far without my help.
Speaking of which, I'd like to let Lee Go Eun write our next project, too.
Well, if the script is good, I have nothing against it.
Sure.
Ah, you know what's tomorrow, right?
The contract with the chairman of Taesan Group.
Yes, at 6pm in Cheongdamdong, I heard.
Since you'll meet him for the first time, it would be good to talk over dinner.
So I asked them to meet there.
You used to like the restaurants there. Also, tomorrow, I'll also expect to hear your answer to my question.
Don't tell me you forgot?
Can you tell me that you don't have any feelings for me?
Then, stop telling me to forget.
Once we start again, there won't be any reason for us to break up ever again.
Min Ah, I'll wait.
Also, tomorrow, I'll expect to hear your answer to my question.
Don't tell me, you forgot.
Your vision got blurry all of a sudden, and you felt dizzy?
Did you have a lot of stress lately, or did you overwork yourself?
What man in Korea doesn't live like that?
Then, are you taking any drugs for long term?
I've been taking an antidepressant for about 3 years now.
Three years... Then, have you had these symptoms before that? No, it never happened before, only recently, about twice.
We'll know more after you get a thorough physical exam and get the results back.
At this point, it seems like a side effect of the antidepressant.
We'll shoot the next scene after 10 minutes!
Gwang Soo, phone.
Gwang Soo? So, over that pretty faced FD chick, the two of you are having a mental race?
Yes. Gwang Soo, in order to capture the heart of a lady; first, you have to show her your own sexy smile often.
Smile.
Director? Look at Sung Min Ah, she's so stunned.
But if I keep sending her the same smile over and over, someday she'll ask.
Ask what?
Why do you smile like that whenever you see me?
Then, you need to say an impactful, short, and concise phrase that will seduce her.
Your eyes make me smile.
Eww, it's so cheesy!
Did you take your pills?
I said did you take your medicine?
How's your fever?
I think it went down.
Stop writing the script for today and rest.
No I'm fine.
I have to hurry and write and turn in the script for episode 13, so I can't rest.
Don't argue and just go to the hospital.
Go and get another shot.
Did you leave yet?
I'm also leaving in a few, so don't be late.
The CEO is sensitive to timeliness.
Or, shall we meet up and go together?
Stay conscious!
Hello? Representative!
Get up.
What's is it?
No, it's nothing...
I think we have to leave now.
Oh...ok... I got it... Lee Go Eun, stay focused.
You're here, President?
Oh, it's been a long time.
There must be a lot of traffic.
Yes. A little.
Why don't we order first, President?
Yes, let's do so.
Hold on, Lee Go Eun.
We're almost at the hospital, so hang in there!
Where is she hurting?
She had an oncoming cold this afternoon, and right now she has a really bad fever.
She overworked for a few days...
How is it?
Her temperature is 40.8.
She must've been in a lot of pain...
Prepare her some fever reducer. Yes.
I think we need to wait until her fever cools down.
Are you conscious now?
What do you mean what happened?
Your fever went over 40 and you fainted.
If it hurts you should've said so.
What about the contract?
Hurry up and go.
Did you forget who was here today?
How could you throw away such an important contract?
There was a situation.
What problem is greater than your dream, your future?
Was Writer Lee Go Eun such an important person to you?
Why can't you answer?
Is Writer Lee Go Eun so important to you?
Lee Go Eun is an important person to me.
I finally realized it.
That Lee Go Eun... is such an important person to me.
[Preview] About when Kim Woo Jin goes to save Jin Hye Rin...
You have a guy, don't you?
Is it Kim Bong Dal?
If you bother Writer Lee one more time, I swear to God.
Kang Hyun Min is all over the place.
I only saw his foot acting.
Am I that bad at acting?
Do you honestly think my acting is that bad?
Have you ever put effort into acting?
What are you doing tonight?
We have to sign a contract.
Why are we writing a contract on Christmas Eve?
...but why does my vision get cloudy at times?
How would getting a check up at the eye hospital sound?
Episode 16 In search of lost time I'm sorry. Something came up.
What came up? What can possibly be more important than your dream and your future? Is Writer Lee Go Eun that important to you?
Why aren't you answering? I asked if Writer Lee Go Eun is that important to you. That's right.
Lee Go Eun is a very important person to me.
I didn't realize it until just now.
How dear she is to me.
Excuse me, the person that was here, where did she go?
Ah, she was discharged earlier.
Lee Go Eun! Lee Go Eun, snap out of it!
If you were sick, you should have told me so!
Are you feeling better now?
What happened with the contract?
It went well.
It's a relief.
Yes, it's a relief.
Get some rest.
By the way, about Kim Woo Jin rescuing Jin Hye Rin. Pardon?
Yes, this is Anthony.
I was just wondering about calling you, too... Don't worry. I heard that the Writer was critically ill.
Is she doing alright?
Yes, she is, but how did you...?
I heard from Miss Sung Min Ah.
The chairman is also impressed by your devoted care of your writer, and does not want to miss the opportunity of working with you.
We'll make another appointment soon for the contract.
Thank you! Bye!
[A K]
The person you called is not available.
Connecting to the voicemail...
Good news!
Another commercial offer.
This time, it's for a painkiller.
Miss Sung Min Ah is in agony because of a bad headache, and tada~ I appear to hand you the pills.
Listen carefully...
From now on until I die, I won't ever do another commercial with you, Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
What's up with her?
Does she not like it because it's painkillers?
"Meltaway Q!"
Thanks to you, the contract will be fine.
Also... Your feelings for Writer Lee Go Eun, I understand. Working together for some time can bring the two of you closer, and you can grow on each other.
However, even after the drama is over, will your feelings stay the same?
I won't be impatient.
When the time comes, I'll be able to hear the answer.
Are you sure you were sick?
Yes. I was really, really sick.
Did you see a doctor?
Of course I did!
Aigoo, if you were that sick, you should have called me.
How could you go see a doctor by yourself?
No, I didn't go alone.
Well, with... a person?
A person?
Who exactly?
Ah, Mom, I'm eating!
You... have a man, right?
Lee Go Eun got a man!
Is it that Kim Bong Dal guy?
Oh, no!
My tummy might get upset!
Aren't you Writer Lee's mother?
Omo, if it isn't the Representative!
I fixed some food for Go Eun, and now I'm on my way home.
I'll give you a ride then.
No, well, you don't have to.
The day is too cold for you to walk.
Have you been doing well lately?
What is there to do well?
Just being busy with my livelihood, not even noticing my own daughter getting sick.
But, by any chance, Representative, do you know Kim Bong Dal?
Kim Bong Dal?
But why are you curious about that person? Well, it seems like my Go Eun is interested in him, but she wouldn't tell me anything.
According to what I've heard, he even has good looks.
Then, take care.
When you're not too busy, come in for a meal.
Then, you should get back.
No, I'll see you get in first and then take off.
Ah, don't worry about me and just get back.
Then, I'll see you again later.
Aigoo, did he take something wrong?
Where did his manners come from?
That's so not like him at all!
I think the Grand Prize for Best Actor should go to Shin Ha Gyoon. His acting was good, and, more importantly, the viewership ratings were excellent.
In terms of viewership ratings, Kang Hyun Min is a good contender, too.
Though his acting is nothing out of the ordinary, but he's scheduled for another SBC drama next year.
The Grand Prize for Best Actor should go to a good actor.
Yes, I understand both of your positions, but how about Jang Joo Sung?
What, Jang Joo Sung?
Yes. Yes, well, the viewership ratings were low, but just looking at acting alone, he was the best this year.
Listen, M broadcasting is giving it to Cha Seung Won, and K broadcasting is giving it to Park Shin Yang.
Yet, we're going to give it to an obscure, aged actor?
It's the Grand Prize after all, it should go to a star with some clout. It's not an award of appreciation.
It's not an award of appreciation.
Yes, isn't that even more reason for Mr. Jang to receive it? Yes, isn't that even more reason for Mr. Jang to receive it?
It literally is the Grand Prize for Best Actor.
Regardless of starship or viewership rating, but solely looking at the acting performance, right? Well, Director, let's take things with a grain of salt.
The awarding ceremony for the Grand Prize is another TV show.
It is another competition for viewership ratings.
Besides, we have to discuss this matter with the Variety Department as they're preparing the ceremony.
So, Director Nam, you should pay attention to our opinions, too, this time.
Then, we shall continue this discussion in our next meeting.
Take care of yourself.
Now, let's eat before going to the next scene!
Then, we'll resume shooting in an hour.
Have a good meal!
Does a top star have to eat at such an open place?
There are no good restaurants around here.
Have you watched "Morning in Kyeongseong" this week?
Kang Hyun Min was practically flying in his action scenes.
All I could see of Kang Hyun Min was his sucky acting.
My eyes are all for Min Ah Noona.
How could you even notice Kang Hyun Min? Hey, isn't that Kang Hyun Min over there?
He is!
He's good looking.
He does look superb. For real!
Don't miss your classes.
Only Kang Hyun Min. Um, Hyung, is Sung Min Ah even prettier than on screen?
Make-up does wonders.
It's Sung Min Ah.
Sung Min Ah!
Hyung, do it quick, hurry!
Sung Min Ah is leaving!
I'd like to get an autograph, too.
By the way, what is your name, young man?
Alright, one person at a time.
What is your name?
- Park Sung Hoon!
Gwang Soo?
From now on, we should always eat in front of an all-girls highschool.
I was thinking of preparing Red Ginseng as presents for the broadcasting companies for this season.
Red Ginseng?
Red Ginseng my bum.
That doesn't suit the scale of the Empire.
Prepare imported wine. Top notch grade.
Yes. Understood.
Present Red Ginseng to the broadcasting companies with seasonal greetings?
Yes, I think that would be appropriate.
Are you in your right mind?
We don't have money for that!
You may leave.
Yes. Ah, PD Joo,
Bring me the CVs of the writers with whom we have contracts.
Our... writers?
The only writer that has a contract with us is just Writer Lee.
Yes, bring hers.
Why do you want her CV all of a sudden?
Do I have to explain that to you?
Sorry, I was too busy.
I sincerely apologize.
But I don't think I can come to the Christmas reunion this year, either, because I have to work on my script.
I guess you guys will have fun without me. Yes, but instead,
I'll treat you generously next year after the drama is done.
See you next year.
Her hobby is to watch movies, specialty is Tae... Official 4th degree Black Belt in Taekwondo... Favorite food is grilled mackerels and... roasted sweet potatoes.
Favorite movie is Love Letter. Love Letter... Yes, I've watched it about 100 times now.
It's really sad, but really beautiful at the same time.
Are you fine?
(In Japanese)
Man, that scared me.
What a shock.
Don't you know how to knock?
I did knock, but you must not have heard me because your ears were covered.
At any rate, why have you come here?
To get some printer paper.
What were you watching, anyway?
Ah, I think I know.
Well, what men normally watch.
Steamy stuff.
I know men watch it quite often.
I said that's really not it.
Oh, that's Love Letter!
Yes, it's Love Letter!
I thought you didn't like this movie?
Just to review my Japanese.
But your Japanese is excellent. Superb.
To learn the dialect of Kobe. Their accent.
My eyes were too busy watching Min Ah Noona.
How could you even notice Kang Hyun Min?
Hyung?
When is the SBC Drama Awards ceremony?
The 31st. Why?
Let's see... possible contenders for the Grand Prize of Best Actor are... me... me...
There's only me!
No way. There's Shin Ha Gyoon.
Ha Gyoon Hyung.
Ah, the Brain...
Shin Ha Gyoon of the Brain is too strong...
Can't let that happen.
The viewers will be totally awed!
Hyung, tell Gwang Soo to get the car ready.
Well, Gwang Soo has been rather busy lately.
The personal assistant is busier than the actor?
Well, that's not what I mean...
Let's just go the two of us today.
However, take the wage for today out of Gwang Soo's payment for the month.
Take it out!
The closer you are, the more clearcut you have to be with money.
Isn't that right, Bumblebee?
You're going to the military service soon?
Yes, I just got my draft notice.
Please take good care of our Hyun Min Hyung. Unlike what appears on TV, there are many surprising things about Hyung.
Yes, I heard from Representative Choi that he requires a lot of extra care.
Actually, Hyun Min Hyung does not like to read the script.
So, when he's playing videogames, you have to read it out loud to him.
Also, when Hyung chooses a drama, he prefers melodrama.
It's because melodramas bring more commerical endorsement offers for the male lead.
That's what he believes.
The more I think about it, the more it doesn't make sense.
How can a drama not have the aspect of melodrama?
Gwang Soo.
Sung Min Ah is very punctual with her schedule?
I told you to go slow, Gwang Soo. Lastly, he may say preposterous things sometimes, but you should just agree with him.
He may not be that bright, but he's a good Hyung.
Ah, hey...
Jin Hye Rin, Kim Woo Jin.
I need something that can bring out their emotions to the maximum...
Writer Lee!
Merry Christmas, a present for you.
What is it this time?
Just take it, it's really just a Christmas present, nothing more.
Omo! The size is perfect, and they're really pretty!
Now that you received my gift, shall we cut to the chase?
This drama is for Kang Hyun Min, and this Kang Hyun Min wants to bawl his eyes out.
Kim Woo Jin is shot, and Jin Hye Rin embraces him and cries.
Yes, but instead of Jin Hye Rin, Kim Woo Jin can cry!
Tears of a man.
How innovating is that?
Well, I suppose it could be innovating, but Sung Min Ah is better...
She is better what?
Ah, well, what I mean is..
Kim Woo Jin gets shot in Jin Hye Rin's place and is bleeding...
Just keep in mind that this is the third time.
Third time for me to ask you to change something.
I ended up swimming in the ocean and kissing that Sung Min Ah. Humanly speaking, if I scratch your back, you should scratch my back, too. Give and Take.
I warn you. If you don't change it this time, I won't go easy on you.
I sent off the new script to the printing office.
I'll be stopping at Writer Lee's studio to drop something off before going home.
Yes, I see.
I'll just take it to her. I need to talk with her anyway.
You, Representative?
What's with that look on your face?
Why, is it something heavy?
I heard about everything.
You're going to serve in the military?
Yes. I got the draft notice unexpectedly.
I've come to say my last good bye.
Stay in good health, Hyung.
I bought it myself from the grocery store.
Hyung! Hyung, thank you for everything, in 2 years from now, I'll be back in better shape.
Yes, I'll be waiting.
I mean, does that even make sense?
He wants to do the crying scene of Jin Hye Rin?
At any rate, what should I do?
He won't get over it easily this time.
PD Joo told me to bring it to you.
Ah. So you came all the way here just to bring this to me?
Well... thats right...
Is the script going well?
Ah, what should I do?
Mr. Kang Hyun Min came by earlier, and...
What did Hyun Min want?
But, why are you here, Representative?
Did you see Writer Lee Go Eun earlier today?
Did Writer Lee say that?
She's such a snitch.
Well, about that sobbing scene, don't you think it would be better if Kim Woo Jin did the crying?
Kim Woo Jin crying?
You sure are professional, understanding my gist right away. Well, at the awards ceremony at the end of the year,
Ha Gyoon Hyung and I are strong candidates for the Grand Prize for Best Actor.
If I were to show an impactful scene at this point, I might be able to secure the award!
How's that? Okay, so you want the script to be revised so that you'd do the crying instead?
Exactly that!
Do you think you can do that?
You only got this far by pure dumb luck.
With your pathetic acting skills, do you really think you can do that?
Are you done joking with me?
Nope, I've still got a lot more to say.
Got it? But... I said, do you understand!
What's up with him?
Why is he like that to me?
Yes, I just saw Hyun Min.
You saw him?
Didn't he throw a fit?
I talked to him with reason, and he accepted it with no problem.
Yes. He'll do according to the script.
He even said he's sorry for bothering you. Is that true? He even said he's sorry for bothering you.
That's a relief.
I mean, you're really amazing, Representative.
You took care of it so easily. I was getting a headache over it.
Don't mention it.
If anything ever troubles you, just let me know any time.
You have come.
The chairman expects a lot from you, Mr. Anthony.
The preparation for relocating your office will be finished within this month.
Ah, Miss Sung Min Ah is already here.
Oh, I finally get to see you.
Aigoo, I've heard a lot about you.
I think I'll need to take business lessons from you, Mr. Anthony.
Don't say something like that even as a joke.
I don't deserve such praise.
Dramas are made by people, after all.
And you, Mr. Anthony, know the importance of people.
Which makes me very glad to be working with you. Well, then,
I look forward to the business you'll lead, Mr. Anthony.
Best wishes.
I don't know how to express my gratitude to you.
Then, instead of saying it to me, show me.
Just like you had made the actress Sung Min Ah into a top star, make your World Production into the best company in the world.
I look forward to it.
A new personal assistant?
Yes, my name is An Sung Mo. You may have heard from Gwang Soo already, I totally abhor posers, hypocrites, and such.
Call me Hyung from now on.
Yes. Yes, Hyung.
At any rate, how did it go with Writer Lee?
Is she going to revise the script?
Hyung, don't get me started on it.
Last night, that bastard Anthony came all the way here, and...
He came here?
My script analysis is elementary level and he called me the worst performing actor ever!
Does that make sense?
I'm a bad actor?
Who does he have to thank for leading the viewership ratings?
Sung Mo?
What else?
My acting.
Yes, you used to be one of the normal viewers, so you would be an accurate judge.
Is the acting performance of this Kang Hyun Min pathetic?
Just be honest.
Is it really true?
What do you mean, yes?
Well, I mean, you have good looks, but but your acting isn't... that great.
Hey, Sung Mo, you must be referring to Hyun Min's debut performance!
Uh... I've watched them all... even the most recent ones.
Well, you told me to be honest.
Gwang Soo...
[Gwang Soo]
Uh, Hyung, what I said earlier didn't upset you, did it?
Why would it upset me?
Who do you think I am?
Sung Mo, I'm not that petty. Well, that's a relief. You know,
I'm really bad at lying.
Just focus on driving. So that we won't be late.
[Kang Hyun Min's impactful performance crosses the sea with his eyes]
Honestly, Kang Hyun Min's acting is overrated.
His good looks covers it all. However, those looks are fading, too.
I'm only watching it for Sung Min Ah. When I see KHM, I can't concentrate on the show.
He sucks.
Hey, what day is better than Christmas Day to confess your felings to her?
You have to make a dash for it!
Well, that's why I bought something for her,
Let's see!
Show us!
Matching rings!
Am I going too forward with this?
Does the woman express the feelings first?
It is the man who has to open up first! Hear, hear!
Besides, a matching set of rings sends a direct message of "let's date."
It's straightforward!
I read a report that the gift that women want the most for Christmas is jewelry!
I got this after reading that.
What's so merry here?
Well, PD Joo got a gift for the pretty FD.
I'm sorry, Representative.
Not separating my personal life from work...
Well, that's life after all.
So what is it that you're hiding?
Let me see what you got her.
They're couple rings.
Supposedly, this is what women want the most for Christmas.
Good luck.
Where do you buy stuff like that?
Would you like me to take them out for you to see?
The second one from the right.
Is it a gift?
My nephew has been begging me for it.
Well, I guess my nephew got a girlfriend, but he's so shy.
What is the nephew's size?
Well, maybe... about this? Ah, I guess his size is the same as the uncle?
We're family, after all.
Then, what about the size of the girl your nephew likes?
I think about this big.
You're going to gift it, you should call and ask first.
If the size doesn't fit after opening the gift, she may think you're not considerate.
Bong Dal Kim.
Mr. Bong Dal.
Do you have plans this evening?
Why else?
We've got to write our contract.
Why are we writing the contract on Christmas Eve?
In the evening even?
Because I say so.
At 8pm, come to the restaurant that... No, I'll decide on the location.
A nice place that I really like.
Must be a shabby place that suits you perfectly.
You'll have to see for yourself. I'll text you. See you later then.
Finish the script before you come out.
I'm done already.
This is the Moonhwa University Hospital.
Your test results from Thursday are out.
Now, don't get too excited because it's Christmas Eve.
Let's finish this quick so we can get home early.
For the next scene, use the 300mm lense and zoom in on Hyun Min's face.
I'm sorry. I only prepared the 200mm lense.
Then, use the 200mm lense, we'll crop later, and magnify it to look like 300mm.
Excuse me.
Where is the FD?
She's probably in Mr. Kang Hyun Min's room.
Well, then... do you have time this evening?
Well, if the shooting gets done early enough, sure. Then, we'll resume shooting in 5 minutes, so tell Mr. Kang Hyun Min to get ready, please.
Yes, I understand.
Woo Jin!
How can this be?
Let's go again.
Soon, people...
Don't worry. Soon, people...
Don't worry. Soon, people...
Let's take a break for 10 minutes.
What exactly is the problem?
Is it because I refused the commercial endorsement deal?
If not, then why are you making me cry for hours like this?
I'm just feeling under the weather today.
I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.
How much have I cried?
My eyes are gonna be all puffed up.
Unni, can you get me an ice pack?
Do you have some time?
Start talking. What is it?
You're not hung up about the commercial...
Is my acting really that bad?
From your perspective, is my acting really poor? From your perspective, is my acting really poor?
Please tell me honestly. As an actress. For you to ask me in person, doesn't that mean you already think so?
Then, let me ask you one thing.
Have you ever put any effort into acting?
Or do you know about your weaknesses?
Then, what about you?
Do you have a weakness you know about?
Who doesn't have weaknesses?
I'm still practicing in front of the mirror at least 1 hour a day to improve my pronunciation since my debut.
Ga Gya Geo Gyeo, like a child learning the alphabet, with a pen between my teeth.
If you really felt a problem with your acting, you yourself have to know what it is to fix it.
No matter what other people tell you, you have to know it for yourself.
Spend some time to think about it.
It doesn't seem like a side effect of the antidepressant.
There doesn't seem to be a problem with your other tests.
Then why does my vision get blurry sometimes?
Hmm... How about getting yourself tested at the opthalmology?
Since you're here already, why don't you get tested.
Tada~ it looks nice.
What exactly is the problem?
Do you have a family member with poor eyesight?
Is that your mother?
Yes, but how? Yes, you have Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy that is maternally inherited.
It progresses really fast with few preliminary symptoms, so your right eye is already in bad shape.
Looking at the pace of the condition, your right eye will lose its sight completely soon.
Once that happens, unfortunately, even your left eye will... eventually, you'll lose sight in both your eyes.
Wow, I hadn't seen you in a while.
Yes, have you been well?
Would you like to order?
Well, I'm waiting for someone today. When he gets here, I will.
Did you get a boyfriend by any chance?
I'm here...
In search of lost time
Please leave a trace after reading the book.
(All entries are by Lee Go Eun)
Since your mother has this condition, you must know it very well.
There is no real way to cure it.
I regret to say this, but you should make preparations before both eyes lose sight.
Ah, what are you doing?
Can't you pour the water properly?
My eyes sting!
I'm not eating!
Does it taste bad?
You eat it, Mom.
You can't even tell sugar and salt apart!
Dummy.
I guess the traffic is bad.
Um... I'm sorry, but we're closing.
Where did you go to be back so late?
You ignored my text and my calls.
Well, was something the matter?
My mother was not well.
Omo. Is she doing okay?
Well, if that's what happened, why didn't you tell me?
Well, I guess you didn't really have the mind to do that.
Since you so desperately wish to renew my contract, I'll do it.
Let's do that later.
It's late. Get back and rest.
Lee Go Eun...
Your feelings for me.
I deceived you.
I was so mean to you. Despite all that, when did you start liking me?
Episode 17 Do not be afraid of the darkness I deceived you. I betrayed you.
I was so mean to you. Despite that, when did you start liking me? Did something happen?
Nothing happened. Get inside and rest. Representative!
Why was he like that?
What happened that he even had tears in his eyes?
Regrettably, it looks like the initial diagnosis still stands.
Since your mother has this condition, you must know this already, but there is no way to cure it at this point.
*Currently, no cure is available.
How to learn Braille
You need to start getting ready for it.
Normally, people with acquired blindness take about 3-5 years to adjust to be able to perform daily functions.
Even just getting out of the house can feel like a formidable challenge.
From just grabbing a spoon to going to the bathroom, you have to learn how to do them by yourself.
Do you have family that could take care of you?
What is the percentage?
The chance of me going blind.
I'll ask one more question.
Why is it me?
My mom wasn't enough?
And yet, after all that, why did you choose me?
Tell me. If you're there, tell me!
Why is it me?
My face... take a good look.
This face...
don't ever forget.
I'm sorry, but can we do it again?
But your eyes were really good just now.
Why? No, my gaze at Jin Hye Rin needs to be full of sadness,
I don't think it was enough this time.
Alright, let's do it one more time.
Carefully look at my face. This face, don't you ever forget.
Let's do it one more time.
The Director said it was okay.
Why do you keep asking him to film it again?
Don't pity me.
I'm not saying this out of pity!
Let's do it one last time.
Carefully look at my face. This face, don't you ever forget it.
How's this one?
You satisfied?
I think it's okay.
Then, get ready for scene 38!
Sung Mo!
Script!
He wants to get better.
Get better at what?
Acting skills.
Hyun Min said that?
I'm going to be worn out, it seems.
Things to do from now on.
Just some things.
Can we speak... for a bit?
Come to the book cafe where we were supposed to meet yesterday.
In Search of Lost Time
After so much time has passed, she finally reads the confession the man had left in the book.
And even the book's title is "In Search of Lost Time"
Lee Go Eun ♥ And even the book's title is "In Search of Lost Time"
Lee Go Eun ♥
When did you come?
I will answer the question you asked yesterday.
It's true that I like you.
I don't know since when, but it's correct that I like you.
I will also ask one question.
Yesterday... why did you cry?
There's something wrong right?
I've been suffering from depression for three years.
That's why I'm crying, so it has nothing to do with you, so don't mind it.
Pretend that the issue of contract renewal never happened.
As if it never happened?
What are you suddently talking about?
There is one reason.
The relationship between a producer and writer should be upright with the right amount of fear and respect.
Since the moment you started liking me, that's impossible.
Working without any emotion, that is my rule.
And that rule is always important.
What about Sung Min Ah?
You didn't do that at that time.
But now it's like that.
We can't continue working together.
Does that answer your question somewhat?
I will take my leave.
You've come again.
Who ... ?
The writer who came last time.
It's good to meet you. I actually wanted to see you.
Is your body fine?
I heard you weren't well yesterday.
Did my son say that yesterday?
I guess I must've heard wrong.
Nowadays is out of control because of the script.
You have a hard time because of my son right?
No, he is so nice to me.
That's good, that you think about him like that. He grew up with a blind single parent, so his personality is _____, but his heart is kind.
I heard...that you couldn't see when he was five...
At that time... my heart hurt so much... At first, my vision started to get blurry, but I thought it would get better over time.
Instead, one eye went blind, and the other eye ended up blind as well.
I found out later that that's how optic neuropathy progresses.
At any rate, you must be a special person to my son.
Why do you think so?
Because he told you about things like that.
Ah. To be honest...
I confessed my feelings to the Representative.. .and I got rejected.
My son... by nature, has no vision for women.
Right? !
I mean I'm this pretty...
I think he really doesn't have an eye for girls.
That doing business together is going to be hard?
Can I ask the reason why you are refusing?
It's a personal issue, so I can't tell you.
I hope that instead of me, you will find a good partner.
Childish! Say if you don't like a person, You're always nagging me about the script.
If you know, hurry up and write the script, everyone is waiting.
I am a crazy girl for worrying about Bong Dal.
Crossing out "cancel the investment deal with Taesan"
Morning of Kyeongsong End of Episode 19
I sent the 19th episode
Ah... it's done, but...
Mr. Kang Hyun Min sure will complain about the hair...
The 19th episode came out.
It came out a lot faster than I thought.
I guess Hyun Min's hairstyle changes, to a shorter haircut.
What? What, what, what?
So you think getting him to cut his hair will be difficult.
Could you please change that part this time?
I was concerned about it, too, actually.
You don't think you can persuade him?
It is to signify the start of Kim Woo Jin's choice of an ordinary life.
To tell you the truth, Hyun Min is currently working on getting an endorsement deal for a shampoo.
An endorsement for shampoo?
So, if he gets a haircut, he won't be able to do it at all.
If it's about an endorsement deal, Kang Hyun Min sure wouldn't want to cut his hair.
I'm sorry, Miss Writer.
I guess it can't be helped.
Really? Oh, thank you!
Miss Writer Lee!
Isn't this Hyun Min's voice?
- Writer Lee!
I guess he's already come to complain.
- Don't tell him that I was here!
Open this door, now!
Oh heavens!
What do you think?
Is this acceptable?
You got a haircut!
A new Woo Jin style.
But, how did you...
I got it cut after I saw the script.
Do you want it shorter?
Just tell me!
Well, Mr. Hyun Min, weren't you after a shampoo endorsement...?
Who cares about endorsements?
Even if a TV or a car endorsement deal is on the table, if it is for the drama, I should cut it!
With overflowing spirit!
Well, actually, to thank her for making your character so awesome.
At any rate, Writer Lee, the last week of Morning in Kyeongseong will be full of this Kang Hyun Min's impactful acting spirit, just you wait.
Fighting!
Director Nam, what do you mean by that? You can't extend Morning in Kyeongseong?
To extend a drama that was originally planned for 20 episodes into 24 all of a sudden will make everybody think that we're only doing it for the ratings.
Rather than that, just finishing the drama with its current quality seems to be the better choice, in my judgment.
Listen, Director Nam. "Morning in Kyeongseong" has just gone over 25%, and is on the verge of getting into the 30% range.
In that case, it may ruin what we have accomplished so far with "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Director Nam, are you crazy?
Do you know how much of the profits from commercials depends on 1% of the ratings?
This isn't a place of art!
This is a business that needs to make a profit! Well, Director... - Director Nam,
I understand your point of view, Director Nam. But this time, I would like you to accept the opinion of the board members including myself.
Four more episodes?
I'm surprised by your lack of enthusiasm.
Don't producers usually welcome extension deals in a situation like this?
Yes, we'll make the necessary preparations.
Does he think 4 is too short?
He says he'll prepare for it.
If we add 4 more episodes, that means 4 more weeks from now, starting with episode 19.
I wonder what the odds are for my eyesight to last until then?
Could I really do it?
No, I must do it.
Please, hang on until then.
Well now, I know how everybody must be tired, but since it's been decided to extend the show, let's do our best to the end! Yes!
What do you think? To spike up the last pitch, new Woo Jin style!
What's with your faces?
Your hair... why did you cut it so soon?
I cut it too soon? Well, We got an extension of 4 more episodes.
Extension?
Well, to prolong the story, the ending will have to change.
Hyun Min, since it's been extended, let's go for 30% of the viewership rating!
What were you doing, not being aware of the extension deal?
My last big impact!
The new haircut of Woo Jin style!
Isn't that swell?
Hyung, is money all your concern?
From now on, don't ever insult my passion and spirit for acting with mere money.
Well, then, are you not going to ask for a raise?
How much more did Sung Min Ah ask for? Are you crazy? You know that you're scheduled for a movie right away, and yet you agreed to the extension?
Min Ah, this isn't just any movie, but a movie directed by Cho Kyu Sik.
Besides, you're the lead actress.
You know fully well how your schedule won't allow for both the drama and the movie.
Isn't it your job to make that schedule work?
So, just do as I said.
Who exactly is the reason why you're doing this?
Is it for Anthony? Or,
Is it because of him?
Don't ever stick me with that moron again!
Why do you keep barging in when I didn't call you?
But I just have one more episode to work on.
How can I add 4 more episodes? In order to write those 4 episodes without sacrificing the quality, we have to revise the script for episode 19 you finished yesterday.
Episode 19... uh...
I know it won't be easy.
However, from episode 19 to 24, you may have to send it to us page by page so we can shoot right away.
The live shooting we had been trying so hard to avoid has now started.
I will have to.
Yes. As this is an emergency, put extra effort and write with speed.
We should discuss the plot.
I'm not doing this because I have ulterior motives.
Did I ask?
The New Episode 19
I'm glad that we got done so fast.
You have to keep this pace from now on.
Ah, before you leave, could you get me a glass of water?
Are you asking me to do that for you?
The writer with high viewership ratings is currently busy writing.
Can't you see it's overflowing?
You can't even pour me some water?
So don't ask me to do it again!
Did you do it on purpose?
Yes, that's right.
Just move!
It spilled to the floor!
Let's go. Just like any other ordinary couple, let's live like that.
Are you sure you won't regret it?
What about your dream?
You won't give up? Sung Mo, get your emotions into it!
You won't give it up?
Ah, this isn't working, either.
I need something to help me get into it.
Are you sure you won't regret?
Are you sure you won't give up on your dream?
As long as you are by my side. Woo Jin,
Woo Jin hugs Hye Rin.
No, no, no!
I can't practice at all like this.
Can't you stop now?
You've been at it for 4 hours already.
We even skipped lunch!
Why didn't I think of this before?
Instead, I can only give you 2 days a week for your drama.
That's the least you can do, Min Ah.
Miss Sung Min Ah?
You can answer it.
Oh, there's no need.
It's not an important call.
The phone is turned off, so the voicemail...
Ignoring my calls, huh?
We have to start shooting in 2 weeks at the latest.
I'm so sorry, Director.
Why do you keep calling me?
If only you had answered it the first time.
You're the one who made me call you several times.
I'm in a meeting with a film production.
That's none of my concern.
Just come to the shooting site right now.
Shooting doesn't start until 2 hours from now!
That's why we should get together and practice!
If you don't come now, I'll call the film production myself, got it?
He must have really lost his mind!
Let's go with this spirit!
I'll be back, Gwang Soo.
Hey, what about lunch?
Looks like I have to go now for the shooting schedule today.
It's ok.
You may go.
I'm really sorry. I'll talk to you later, Director.
They must be really going great together.
Kang Hyun Min and Min Ah, I mean.
Yes? Ah, no, that's not really... At any rate, there must be no wedding announcements before the movie release.
Yes? Just like any other ordinary couple, let's live like that.
Just like any other ...
Isn't it really cold outside?
We should practice it like we're really doing it!
Practice is only practice.
This Kang Hyun Min's acting is for real!
Do you normally practice so casually, Miss Sung Min Ah?
If you really want to do it for real, get rid of that script first.
Now, ready, action!
Let's leave. Just like any other ordinary couple, let's live like that.
Are you sure you won't regret?
Can you really give up on your dream and live on?
As long as you're with me.
Woo Jin...
Mr. Kang Hyun Min ...
We start shooting in 10 minutes.
Go and clear up her misunderstanding!
Is that petty little misunderstanding that important?
My burning passion for acting won't die because of it!
Now, one more time.
Why do you have to be so extreme in everything?
I e-mailed you the script for episode 19, Mr. Kim Bong Dal.
Wow, he doesn't even text me back any more.
Start outlining episode 20.
We can't always work on it together.
Since they've worked for me, I know how skilled and faithful they are.
Well, with your recommendation, I know they must be good, Sunbae.
Hm, looks like they have quite some experience?
They've gone through a lot in this field.
They'll be a great asset to you.
You have to pay them at least that much.
At any rate, why are you handing over such great workers? Ah, well, it's because...
I just needed to stop at the office.
Yes, I'll be there in about 2 hours.
Is this World Production's Joo Dong Suk PD?
Yes, but who is this?
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Drama Production Company Golden Song.
We would like to offer you a position at our company with extra benefits.
Could we have a meeting?
Ah, uh, me?
Yes, I heard that you are very talented.
We'll give you 20% more than your current salary. Ah, yes, well, but, actually, I'm currently working on a project.
Also, to leave my current company all of a sudden seems... Of course, we understand.
You can take your time to consider our offer while finishing up with your current project.
We'll contact you again.
What now? You were so heartbroken by that girl, Did something good happen?
I just got a job offer from another drama production company. Hey, you too?
I got one, too!
We all got an offer from somewhere?
Even so, I want to keep working with Representative Kim to the end.
I suppose I will, too.
At any rate, the salary they offered was pretty tempting.
True, after all, our company is on the low side when it comes to salaries in this field.
Speaking of which, I have a good idea.
The four of us can keep our loyalty, but let's ask for a raise of 10%.
Or else, we'll quit.
Threaten him like that in fake?
Isn't it great?
I'm in, too.
Are you in?
In.
He's in, too.
What are you doing so huddled up together?
Representative, I have something to tell you.
I'll listen to it later.
I have something to say first.
Once "Morning in Kyeongseong" is finished, I'm going to close my company.
What? I got a partnership offer from Taesan Group, but they didn't want to keep your employment.
By Taesan ... One of the top, leading companies in the country.
Therefore, everybody needs to look for a new job once the drama is over.
Team Leader Park, you should calculate the severance fee for everyone and put it on my desk.
Hey, what was that?
Did we just get backstabbed?
I heard that wrong, right?
No wonder he had been surprisingly nice to us lately.
What was the number from that other production company?
Crossing out "Transfer employees (close the company)"
Sweet Potato
I just got done with episode 20.
So, if you're in the office, make a short trip to my studio.
You did pretty well by yourself.
Where? Scene 38, If Hye Rin is meeting with Representative Kang, is she betraying Woo Jin again?
Ah, that's because there is a surprise element later on.
It's all explained in scene 56.
Ah, no, nothing.
Yes, you did well up to the ending.
You didn't even read it to the end!
You just flipped the page, and you read it all?
Yes, speedreading.
Besides, I said it's good.
Why are you complaining?
Just keep writing the script. Starting tomorrow, we'll have to go page by page.
Moonhwa University Hospital, please.
Your condition is progressing much faster than most other patients.
Unfortunately, your right eye has already lost it's sight.
It's already started for your left eye, too.
How long will it take?
For the left eye to lose sight completely?
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.
He was so careless and rude.
Was I clingy or what?
Is reading this that hard?
Why does it have 2 sheets of page 3?
Then, he didn't get to see scene 56 at all.
What do you think.
You didn't even read to the end!
Why did he lie like that?
At first, my vision was just blurry a little.
I thought it would get better over time.
But one eye lost its sight, and eventually, the other one did, too.
It's overflowing!
I found out later that that's how optic neuropathy progresses.
This can't be!
Are you inside?
What to do from now on: 1. Mother 2.
LearnBraille 6.
Care facility for the blind
At least up until now, Writer Lee has been good about not making us do live shooting.
Of course, that ends tomorrow.
It's been 5 years since the last time I had to do that dogged live shooting.
Do you think you can finish Morning of Kyeongseong if I am not here?
Can you do it?
Does that Taesan or whatever company want you to start working with them sooner?
I heard from Joo PD.
I heard that you got a partnership offer there.
Go if you must, but only after finishing this.
Even though I have been calling you crazy dog and made fun of you, this drama doesn't work even for a day without you, Representative Kim.
Therefore, until this is done, don't even think about running away.
Now, let's pick up the pace!
It's going to get dark soon!
Is the preparation for the move going well?
I'm talking about the move to Taesan Group.
When will it be?
Ah, that matter ... I want to send flowers. When is it?
Well, the priority at the moment is "Morning in Kyeongseong."
So just focus on the drama for now.
The date for the move hasn't been decided yet?
We'll get to it eventually.
ForgetLeeGo Eun
Therelationshipbetweenthe writerandtheproducer requires a balanced tension of fear and respect.
Now that you have started to like me, that's impossible.
Crossingout"ForgetLee GoEun"
Shall we go in?
Too much cold air isn't good for you.
Maybe in just a little bit.
You're busy.
My employees are doing all the work.
Still, as the representative, you should be present in the work place.
You shouldn't just leave all the work to your employees.
What? When I was young, what was it like when I made fun of you and was mean because you couldn't see?
Wasn't it upsetting?
When was that...such a long time ago.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Did something bad happen to you?
Once my current drama is done, I might be off to abroad because my business is going so well.
So stay still. Since I might not be able to see your face for a while,
I want to keep your face in my eyes.
It's a good thing that your business is going well.
Instead of worrying, just go and return, because I will be fine.
Let's go inside, Mom.
By the way, is that a new scarf?
I got it as a gift.
She begged me not to tell you... Actually, to tell you the truth, I... confessed my feelings to the Representative and got rejected.
Mychild just doesn't have a good eye for women.
I'm pretty like this.
I agree that he doesn't have an eye for women.
I brought a present for you.
There's a present?
I knit it myself, It keeps you really warm in the winter.
If you look here, it says B D K.
B-D-K?
You shouldn't do that to such a nice young lady. If it's because you have to go abroad, tell her.
Because it seems to me, she really is a nice girl.
Did you finish the script?
it's cold. Instead of catching cold again, go in.
How long were you going to conceal it?
Until when were you going to conceal the fact that you are going blind?
You said it was depression.
You said it had nothing to do with me and it was none of my business.
It's none of your business so beat it.
How can it not concern me?
What you are saying about my not being able to see is correct.
I won't be able to eat by myself or go to the bathroom.
I won't be able to see the dramas which I made.
or the scripts either.
I won't be able to see your face And where you are standing, and whether you are smiling or crying
I won't be able to see.
Is that why you are giving up?
What if I say it doesn't matter to me?
For me, it doesn't matter.
The last tape of "Morning in Kyeongseong" hasn't made it to the editing room yet.
Even if it's just 1% of hope, that's better than nothing.
A miracle is not something you wait for, but something you create.
The Representative, the Representative, on his way, had an accident...
You must come back with that miracle!
The Finale The Last of the King, or The Last King. Where have you been?
Did you finish the script? Don't catch a cold in this cold weather. Hurry and go in.
Until when are you going to hide that? Until when are you going to hide the fact you're going blind now? You said, what, depression?
Didn't you say it's none of my business so don't bother?
It's none of your business, so back off.
Why is it none of my business?
What can you do for me, then? That's right. As you said, it's true that I won't be able to see any longer.
I won't be able to eat or go to the washroom by myself. I won't be able to see the dramas I made, or your scripts,
or your face either.
Even where you're standing, even whether you're smiling at me or crying,
I won't be able to see all of them.
Is that why you're giving up?
What if I say it still doesn't matter?
I'm saying it doesn't matter to me.
It will be difficult (for you) to endure.
Even so, I want to go that way.
Let's go together.
Maybe, this will be my last time to see the sunrise.
Even if you can't see, I will make you be able to feel it.
And beside you, I will be there.
Since we came all the way here, will we have some time to sleep?
What... what did you say?
Why are you so startled?
Wa... wait!
I... am... not that easy of a woman.
What are you thinking now?
I'm saying let's take a short nap in the car.
Considering that our way back home would be a great hardship, don't you think we should take a nap?
So vulgar!
I'm so vulgar!
With this driving skill, how on earth did you get your driving license?
I told you, this is the first time I'm driving since I got the license!
To be precise, this is your second time.
Once to come here, and second time to go back.
If it's your second time, there should be some improvement.
You chickened out!
Just look where you're driving!
Okay. From now on, for the entire 24 episodes including the extended 4 episodes, we should run around busily making sure they will be aired with no accident.
Well, then do your best in your post.
You can do it, right?
I will even kill Jin Hye Rin if I have to at the last episode to make sure, so don't worry.
The script for Episode 20 arrived!
Did you send it to all of the cast and staff as well?
Yes.
Well, well, hurry up.
Let's run again!
Kim Woo Jin, Kim Woo Jin, Kim Woo Jin, KIM WOO JIN! Sung Mo, - how many scenes in total?
It's 52 vs 36.
Overwhelmingly, you have many more scenes!
Finally, my effort is shining.
The real value of my acting on the screen finally touched Writer Lee. Therefore, Sung Mo, you should try, too.
Find your flaw.
The one who doesn know about one's self would never be able to improve.
Sung Mo, what is your flaw?
Well, I don't know, my flaw is...
Hemorrhoids?
You just need to go to the hospital to treat it. Well, by the way, Hyung, all those lines, will you be able to memorize them all?
If there are only a few lines, that's the problem, not the other way around.
Taking this opportunity, I should clearly show Kang Hyun Min's burning acting skills!
At the begining of Episode 21, Jin Hye Rin is captured by President Kang.
To save Hye Rin, Kim Woo Jin will fight alone against all the enemies.
So that we can film Jin Hye Rin's scenes at once, all together in a long take?
It can enhance it's dramatic tension and also help us manage the filming schedule.
Kang Hyun Min would have a hard time, though.
Good, let's proceed in that way.
But how are your eyes? Are they alright?
The other side's eye is still fine.
What are you doing now, not writing?
Ah, I think I'm really a genius, don't you think so?
But really...when was it that you started to like?
When did you start to like me?
So, for me... When there was the argument about plagiarism, you... you said... you would believe me no matter what...
What about you?
I don't remember.
I told you everything!
Just write your script.
Hurry up and tell me! When was it?
If you don't tell me, I won't write any more.
If you finish your script, then I will tell you.
That's really low.
Did you find that out just now?
Ready, action!
I have never forgotten about you, not even for a moment.
On that day when we first met at Woo Mi Theater...
The day we first met ...
I will do it again.
I have never forgotten about you, not even for a moment. On that day when we first met at Woo Mi Theater, when we aimed a gun at each other...
On that day...
What was the next line?
Let's read the script once and try again.
No, Director!
Let's try again.
Let's take a 5-minute break.
I really memorized all!
Just use a prompter. What?
Whom do you think is responsible for this?
Are you saying I should cheat for acting, while reading lines from a prompter?
I was just trying to help.
You seem to think I can't do this, but wait and see.
I will act perfectly after memorizing all the lines.
I have never forgotten about all of them, not even for a moment.
So, please, believe me.
This is the only choice to let us be together.
Hyun Min! Everything was great, including your last stare!
Ha! Of course, who am I! ?
Considering the speed of progress of your disease, it will be a burden if you keep working.
But there is something I must do.
Recently, in Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Florida, U.S., there was the first clinical trial of DNA treatment for this disease.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but I have to write the script and send it to the staff as soon as possible.
Geez, I won't interrupt, so just keep writing!
Hey, do you have an assistant writer?
No, why?
Then, why do you have two toothbrushes?
Oh, that is...
I haven't seen these before, either.
Wait, aren't these for men?
No, no... that's not... You!
By any chance, that Bong Dal or something, did you let him in here all the time?
No, Mom, that's not the case!
Oh, you're here!
Oh, you came at the right time.
Representative, you said you know the guy named Kim Bong Dal.
Please give me his contact detail.
Ah Mom, that's not the case.
What do you mean that's not the case? Here are two toothbrushes, and even a man's lotion. These are clearly its evidence!
This bastard!
I have to see his face! Ah...
Mother... There must be some misunderstanding.
The guy named Kim Bong Dal isn't that bad.
That's why I'm saying I will meet him.
Mom, later, later, I will introduce him to you later.
Later my ass!
I can just call him myself now.
Mom... MOM!
Here it is!
Bong Dal!
It's my alarm.
Give it back to me!
Ah, mom, so... just leave!
Can't you see me not being able to work now?
Anyway, you!
WARNING!
It's a cup of coffee.
By the way, why did you write it yesterday?
Over there, on the pillar.
Well, that's because you seemed to have a really hard time, so I just wrote it on there.
Then, of course, that's all.
What else can it be?
Many women don't know their own feelings.
Fine. If your feeling for me is that deep, I won't resist it any longer, not like I did before.
You fell for me, right?
Please, don't have such illusions!
You want to keep your pride?
I also know well about women's pride.
Seriously... what the... Cute. Lovely.
There's a limit to how simpleminded you can get...
What if he starts clinging to me like a leech?
I'm just laughing because of how ridiculous he is.
Ridiculous...
I was meaning to call you as well.
I know you're busy.
My schedules are stacked because of the movie and the drama.
Well I'm calling for your next project which we discussed before.
What do you think to work for Writer Kim Eun Sook's drama? (of "Secret Garden""A Gentleman's Dignity")
That'd be excellent if we work with Writer Kim Eun Sook!
But, did the Rep. agree to that?
To work with Writer Kim Eun Sook?
Oh... did you not hear the news yet...? What news? Oh... did you not hear the news yet...?
What news?
Anthony has declined Tae San group's offer due to personal reasons.
They're saying you declined Tae San group's investment offer due to personal reasons.
So what exactly is that personal reason?
I'll tell you on the day "Morning in Kyeongseong's" last episode airs.
So please finish well.
Prepare the next scene!
23.9!
Good work everyone.
I want to review the documents so send them over.
Happy New Years, Morning in Kyeongseong success to 26.8% rating!
1, 2, 3!
"Morning in Kyeongseong", the New Year's result.
- the highest viewership rate 26.8%.
I've finished up to Scene 52. Oh, PD Joo, we will send the script up to Scene 52 by e-mail, so check your e-mail right away.
"Morning in Kyeongseong", broke its highest viewership rate again to 27.3%.
Here are the scripts!
29.3!
YAY!
"Morning in Kyeongseong", only left for its last episode, aiming to be over 30%.
Send it by e-mail, quickly.
I've sent the e-mail too. Now, it's really DONE!
You've done a great job.
You would want to have a good sleep, but you need to go somewhere with me.
Change your clothes and come out.
Why are you staying there?
Who is...?
The writer who gave you a scarf present.
I know who it is by her voice.
Mom, I kept my promise.
What... promise?
There is something like that.
What is... that promise?
I've just received a message from the U.S.
Please come to the hospital as soon as possible.
The second clinical trial's patient list is announced.
You're on that list. As I've told you before, the possibility to avoid your blindness is as low as a miracle, but let's hope for that miracle.
Ah, and the reason I asked you to come here urgently was because you need to leave tomorrow, right away.
To meet the due date per Florida time, you must leave for Florida tomorrow.
What is that expression about?
I want to send you right now, today!
What? You said before, that a miracle is not something you wait for, but something you make. How great there is at least 1% of hope.
Even if you leave without seeing the last episode, instead, you must make with that miracle and come back.
So that you can keep seeing my face.
Hurry up to make a reservation for an airplane ticket!
What are you doing over there?
Did you book the ticket?
Its departure time will be 3PM at Incheon International Airport.
You might not have any chance to see the staff before leaving.
I will tell them for you.
Ah, by the way, what are you doing, not sleeping?
You can't sleep because you're thinking about me, right?
Why do I like such a heartless person like you?
But even so, you can't take it back.
You too, Representative.
What are you thinking about so intently? Well, today, on this last airdate, it must be like a live show, but do you still have time to come up here?
I don't have much time to be idle, but I can still spare some for this.
Time flies so fast, right?
Already it's the last episode.
You remember what happened here on that day you got the broadcasting schedule.
How can I forget that?
I've received a big one from you to celebrate to be on board with you, Director.
On that day, I couldn't control my strength.
Please forget about that.
We should work together again for the next drama.
Rather than me, you would need to hurry to hold onto Writer Lee Go Eun.
So far, I've been thankful to you.
You act as if we won't see each other again.
I'm thankful (to you), too.
You've never called me Representative Oh.
I'm sorry. Out of the blue, what are you saying?
I didn't know you couldn't be by your father's deathbed.
I'm not sure if you will believe me, but this is my sincere apology.
Comrade Kim, before this midnight, you should give this to Hye Rin.
Before this midnight?
Otherwise, we will be in danger.
Can you do it?
Then, I'll do it.
What is the next scene?
There are only scenes left which can be filmed when Ms. Sung Min Ah arrives.
PD Joo!
Isn't Min Ah's movie schedule done yet?
Yes, it just finished, so they just left to come here.
They will arrive in two hours. Hyun Min, why don't you go to your car and take a rest?
Is Sung Min Ah coming a bit late?
She's on her way, but it seems to take a bit of time.
We will take a break for a while!
Have a good trip.
Once you arrive, you must call me.
Why aren't you answering me?
Because there is no need to say it.
Attention please, passengers for the flight for Florida at 3 PM, please come to the gate for boarding now.
Attention please, passengers for the flight for Florida at 3 PM... Attention please, passengers for the flight for Florida at 3 PM...
Don't worry too much,
I will be back soon.
Yes, PD Joo? Representative, we have a big problem! Yes, PD Joo?
Representative, we have a big problem!
Ms.Sung Min Ah couldn't come to the filming site yet!
She couldn't come to the site yet?
Yes, because of the traffic jam, she said she would arrive around at 7PM.
No, that can't be.
We should stop that accident, no matter what it takes, got it?
South Korea Passport
Passengers for the flight for Florida at 3 PM, the airplane will take off soon, so please proceed the boarding immediately.
What the? You're not on the plane?
There is an accident at the filming site.
I'm not asking that. You should've left within today.
We should sort things out at the filming site first.
Why does it have to be you?
As if there is no one at the site who will take care of that!
And it's not as if there is no flight schedule to go to Florida, either.
I'm going to take the flight at 11:45PM tonight, so don't worry.
Do you think I will do things without preparing such a measure?
What is it to be sorted out?
You should revise the script right away.
Script?
Since Sung Min Ah is coming late, the scenes of Jin Hye Rin couldn't be filmed.
How many scenes of Jin Hye Rin are at the last part?
Five scenes.
We don't have time to film all 5 scenes, so you should reduce as many as possible, maybe to 2 scenes.
Then, there won't be enough to fill the time.
I will take care of that with the editor. You can do it, right?
I have to do it, of course.
I don't even have my laptop. How can I revise the script, then?
Sit. Sit.
You should've driven slowly on this snowy road!
Aish, I'm going crazy.
Worry about that later.
Where's this?
I couldn't even get out of Jecheon.
Listen to what I say carefully.
Get out of your car immediately, stop any motorcycle passing by and ride it to come to the site.
What? "Motorcycle"?
Tell that motorcycle rider to not speed up because it can be dangerous.
To avoid the worst broadcasting accident, this is the only way.
Okay, I got it.
I'm on my way to the filming site as well, so see you there.
Please take good care of me.
Wow, Sung Min Ah is really pretty!
Because of the accident and the traffic jam...
- Be careful! - Yes, it's a snowy road, so be careful!
We have a big problem.
The last tape for "Morning in Kyeongseong" hasn't been handed over to the editing room.
What on earth are you talking about?
The tape hasn't been handed over yet?
Sung Min Ah's arrival at the filming site has been delayed, so the filming crews are now standing by.
Shouldn't we do something, Director Nam?
Then, right now, please check about the status at the filming site, and give me the report.
At this rate, what if there is a broadcasting accident?
Well, at the moment, we have no choice but to wait, trusting Representative Kim.
Before starting the last episode, edit some previous scenes in 3 minutes.
3 minutes time?
Yes, because we don't have enough scenes to air now. And make a flashback of Jin Hye Rin, a bit longer than 2 minutes.
Yes, yes, I got it.
Director, she's on her way, but I couldn't contact her.
For now, send the tape for the first part.
And what about Min Ah?
They say that she left with a motorcycle rider, but after that, I can't find her.
At this rate, what if the last episode can't be aired?
Don't worry too much. Ms. Sung Min Ah will arrive in time.
And Writer Lee Go Eun will reduce the later part to 2 scenes and it tosend us.
Then, we can adjust the later part like that, but in the middle, what about Scene 28 and Scene 31?
Well, we should film Hyun Min's side first.
My side first?
What do you mean? They are dialogue scenes between two, but how can we film them without her?
Oh, you.
Change into Jin Hye Rin's clothes immediately, only the tops.
What do you mean, all of a sudden, that you can't go with me now?
If two of us leave now, the possibility to get caught will be increased.
So, please, leave by yourself.
No, I can never do that. We live together, and we die together.
Then, Hyun Min's sides of Scene 28 and Scene 31 are all done.
Now, it will work only if Min Ah arrives.
Have you finished the script?
Yes, I just sent it now.
How about Ms. Sung Min Ah?
Ah, that's a relief.
Good work. Since your work is done, take a rest there.
Thanks to you, today's episode will be aired well.
Good to hear that.
I'm looking forward to the last episode.
Director, I'm so sorry!
I'm too late, aren't I?
No, no, it must have been so hard for you to hurry up to come here.
Well, let's hurry up, as Min Ah arrived!
Costume team!
Sorry, you were waiting for a long time, weren't you?
A lot. Very much a lot.
You're not the only one who has been in a movie here!
Anyway, let's see after it's done.
Let's do it, then!
Now my work is really done. Everything will be alright.
Don't worry, Go Eun.
If the two of us leave together, the possibility of us getting caught will be increased.
Here is the last tape of "Morning in Kyeongseong".
If you leave now, it will be still tight.
Without you, Crazy Dog, nothing is going well here, even for a day.
Please work hard until the end.
Director, you've done good work.
I will accept such gratitude later.
Be safe on your trip.
Have you left?
When are you going to arrive?
I will be there after handing over the tape to the station, so wait a little more.
You will come after handing over the tape to the station?
That can be done by PD Joo.
Must you do this to the end?
Because this is the end. I really want to hand it over myself.
What if you miss the flight at this rate?
It's the flight at 11:45PM.
I have still enough time even if I stop by the station.
Instead, come as soon as you can.
By the way, why are you going to the airport?
Just because... I'm going abroad to take a break.
Ah, this is not the first time to make us worry to death!
There isn't much time left until its airtime...
Anthony is bringing the last tape now.
He said that he can bring it in time.
Then we just have to wait a little longer.
We should see until he actually arrives!
Florida... 11:45 PM...
He said it's 11:45 PM flight for sure.
There is no flight for 11:45PM?
That's correct.
Could you check one more time?
I'm sorry, customer...
The last flight for Florida was at 3PM, so the next flight will be at 3PM, tomorrow.
It's 9:20 PM.
Why did you lie? From the beginning, there was no flight leaving at 11:45 PM, but why did you lie to me?
Because, if I told you honestly, you wouldn't have let me go.
This was the last chance to treat your eyes, Representative!
That's right, it might have been the last, very tiny chance.
Maybe, I wanted to find that slightest hope like a piece of thread.
But this is my last drama. When I knew that my last drama could be horribly ruined,
I couldn't just leave it behind.
Are you saying it was more important than your own eyes?
Yes. Because this is my last drama as well as your first drama.
I'm sorry. See you later.
What was it about, during your phone conversation?
Don't mind that.
Keep your eyes on the road.
Representative, can you hear me?
Instead of me, you should go and hand it over.
No! I can't leave you behind like this.
Can you see those people over there?
They must have called an ambulance. I'm fine, so hurry up and bring that tape.
Hurry up, or you will hear a lot of blames from me later.
There is someone hurt here because of a car accident.
Please hurry and come!
Where we are is...
Taxi Driver, can't you hurry?
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
PD Joo.
It's not me...
Representative...
Representative was hurt.
What do you mean?
150 Joules!
200 Joules.
The viewership rate is 32.3%.
It's a jackpot!
Good work, everyone.
I may not trust anyone in the world, and sometimes I don't trust even myself, but I, such a person like that... trust you.
Let's think about something warm.
For me... baked sweet potatoes.
The first thing in your mind is that cheap baked sweet potatoes?
What's wrong with baked sweet potatoes?
I... hated it so much.
That awful poverty... My father who left once I was born so that I don't even know his face.
Even my mother who can't see.
I hated all of them, and I was embarrassed about them.
And I even told people that my parents passed away, leaving their wealth to me.
That I grew up happily.
I... am a coward.
This person isn't going to die so easily.
Representative, open your eyes.
I said to open your eyes.
His pulse came back.
Back Hug.
Everybody, you won't freeze to death if you do like we do.
That's OK.
1 Year Later.
Ah, that was good work.
Are the photos good?
Ah, you two deserve the fame of "the best couple in the entertainment world", you really look good together.
We do, right, Photographer Hong Hang Joon?
Then, for the next year, you should renew the contract with us again.
Honey, smiling!
For the next CF deal, let's aim for the water purifier products.
Another CF, again?
What do you mean, "again"?
To catch up to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, we still have a long way to go!
Compliment!
You're so smart~!
Smart!
Smart~!
You're much smarter than Brad Pitt!
Smarter than Brad Pitt?
That's right, I'm like Brad Pitt.
Then I am?
Then my honey is like Angelina Jolie.
You look so pretty today.
After 1 year, those two, who had a lot of rumors and scandals, they became a real couple.
And Director Nam, who was promoted from Director of Drama to Chief Director of Production, made up with the father he was fighting with.
In Yeong, you should greet your grandfather.
Hello, Grandfather.
Can you recognize me, your grandfather?
Now, there is no one who doesn't know that Director Nam's father is the Chairman of Empire Production.
And Empire Production is still the best drama production company in Korea.
But the only change is... they have a new representative.
Sunbaenim, what are you doing here without any appointment? Well, I was passing by, but had a car accident.
Don't worry too much, I didn't get hurt a lot.
Do you have about 3 million won? [about US$3,000]
Representative Oh, who got kicked out, is trying hard to come back. That's about it.
Everyone, I dare say... Soon the flashy video's era will go away, and the unlimited imagination's era listening with your ears, the era of radio dramas will come again.
That's all I prepared.
Everything sounds good.
But are there any good writers these days, writing the radio dramas well like the old times?
It's the almost-extinct genre, so there wouldn't be any writer to do it.
Exactly. Ladies and gentlemen, here let me present the top star writer in current Korean drama industry,
Writer Lee Go Eun!
Hello everyone. I am Writer Lee Go Eun.
I will work hard.
Who can resist your speech skill?
Must you wear the sunglasses?
It looks cool! But no matter how much I think,
I think it's my loss to be a radio drama writer.
Are you going to change your words now?
Well, you're the one who always changes your words as easily as flipping your palm over, Representative!
Until when are you going to call me "Representative"?
Depending on how you treat me.
Even though he's just a third-rate producer now, he's forever the King of Drama in my mind.
Thanks to the wonderful Manager trucalling Thanks to our segmenters: mihaelagh, IceHurt, subject narin78, killerbunnies, trucalling, pumpkinattack, kasxia, steffioana26,
Emma: No!
Emma, come on, it's time for bed.
I'm putting my foot down.
You gotta put your pajamas on.
What if Daddy gives you a cookie?
Congratulations, Emma.
You're already manipulating men at a third grade level.
You're the parent.
You need to stand up to your daughter.
If you're so good at this, you get her into pajamas.
- Okay. Yeah, I will.
Listen, this behavior has got to stop.
When I say it's bedtime, it's bedtime.
And when I say it's cookie time, it's cookie time.
Mm, who do you love the most?
- Bon-Bon.
- Bon-Bon. That's right.
And Bon-Bon loves you the most.
♪ Can take your life and change directions ♪
- She's coming, she's coming! - (Screams)
Ever since Brad left, she can't be alone.
I don't know if you know this, but she can be kind of annoying.
She hasn't let me out of her sight in over a week, and now she wants to hang out today and tonight.
No! Tonight is our special night.
Clash of Dragons is on.
That's why I'm trying to avoid her.
Bonnie: Hey, why is this door locked?
- Oh! - Hey, guys. I just wanted to...
Oh. Mom... do you mind?
Kind of in the middle of something here.
Yeah, I can come back.
Well, actually, if you're anything like your dad, I can just wait in the hall for a couple of minutes.
Will you just tell her?
Mom, there's something I need to talk to you about.
But first, I gotta go to practice, so I'll see you later, okay? Bye.
So... what are you up to today?
I'm just going to work.
I don't suppose you could bring a friend.
- Not really. - Oh.
Here's that salad you ordered for Mary.
I know the show's paying for it.
That's why it's a $53 salad.
Mary's blood sugar's crashing.
Are there cranberries on this?
These look like cranberries!
She can just pick them off like any normal person.
Mary Hart is not a normal person.
She's a star.
It's a completely different beast.
Please don't tell anyone you heard me call her a beast.
Dude, you gotta stand up to her once in a while.
Don't let her walk all over you.
Look, Ben, I don't have time.
Look, I don't have time for this right now, okay?
- You're a mess.
- I'm fine! Okay? !
- Look, I'm fine! - (Shutter clicks)
- I'm fi...
- Does this look fine to you?
Look, man, we're just... we're all under a lot of stress, all right?
This week, it's our big Mary Hart SweetHarts Special, and everything just needs to be perfect because Mary likes perfect.
Oh, my God! She's coming!
Save yourself! Go!
I didn't realize you actually had to go to a farm and plant the vegetables first.
And could you possibly be more incompetent?
I said I wanted to give away Crock-Pots.
You forgot the "Crock" part of the "Pot".
There's 50 pounds of weed sitting on my loading dock!
And... are these cranberries?
You know how much I hate cranberries.
I know, Mary.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
How does this sound to you, Tucker?
Hello, America.
I'm Mary Hart.
On tonight's show, the death of a senior producer who gave me cranberries!
How could you not know after all these years together that I hate cranberries?
! I hate them...
Ah, my good Lord Craigmore, bastard son of Leon Ravenhelm, to what do I owe this honor?
Ah, Lady Zelda Dragonbreast,
I have come to avenge thee... and perhaps do some ravaging?
Well, the ravaging will hate to wait because seriously, the show's about to start.
I couldn't find mutton, so chicken wings will have to do.
Bonnie:
Open up! It's me!
I found mutton!
Well, she either figured it out on her own, or she guilted me into inviting her.
I'm honestly not sure.
Just... just tell her to go away.
I'll tell her that it's just us tonight.
I mean, sure. Yeah.
I was devastated when Brad left, you know, but now, I'm just lonely.
You know, and I can't go get all un-lonely because I'm married.
Stupid morals.
Mary: Hello, America.
On tonight's show, the death of a senior producer who gave me cranberries!
Yeah, thanks for the instant replay, but I'm still picking the cranberries out of my ears, so I'm good.
Dude, I'm trying to show you how pathetic you look.
You know, I wish I had physical proof of my mistakes.
Not now, Emma.
Ben, why is this such a big deal?
All I see is a completely normal employee-employer relationship.
Oh? Oh, is that what you see?
Oh, okay. Then maybe we should take a survey and find out what other people think.
How about I just post it online and get some feedback for you?
- Oh, you do that.
- Oh, I will.
- Here I go.
- So doing it.
- So not caring.
- Three, two, one...
No. Stop.
Fine. Yes, Mary is a horrible person.
She's also a compulsive gambler and a philanderer, so what's your point?
You're better than this!
You've gotta stand up for yourself, man.
Fine. I'll talk to her.
You're really lucky.
How about I buy you a beer to celebrate, huh?
On tonight's show, - the death of a senior producer - (Tablet beeps) who gave me cranberries!
How could you not remember after all of these years... (Ben laughing)
Cats are stupid.
I think we lost her!
I knew your mom was fast, but she actually scissor-kicked over the subway turnstiles.
You guys are amateurs.
Always run through a bar.
She has to stop.
Wait, wait, wait. This isn't good.
Cranberries?
How could you not remember after all of these years of working together how much I hate cranberries? !
How is this online? !
A million views?
Oh, my God. I have to warn Tucker.
Oh, no. Come on.
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.
Aah, pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
- Aah, come on. Voicemail? - (Elevator dings)
Hey, perfect.
Can you please take Emma to daycare?
Mary's about to kill Tucker.
Oh. Yeah. Tell me when that's on.
I want to record it.
Riley: Oh, my God, Danny.
Your mother is driving me crazy!
Danny: Don't get mad at me!
You're the one who invited her over last night!
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's only because you couldn't stand up to her.
She spent the night at my place and then she went to breakfast with us, and now she's gonna go to the movies with us?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Tell her I'd rather spend time along with my girlfriend than with my own mother?
Danny, that's exactly what you're supposed to do.
I mean, if you don't stand up to her now, this is only going to get worse.
I mean, today it's a Crock-Pot, tomorrow it's our anniversary.
Wait, tomorrow's our anniversary?
I mean... tomorrow's our anniversary.
Hope you didn't forget.
Oh, I think we both know how this is gonna end.
Someone is about to get schooled... and it ain't gonna be me.
High five it.
Fist it.
Care to explain what this is?
It's basically just a really big phone.
There's 50 pounds of weed on my loading dock.
They're saying, "Mary has no Hart."
I wish that didn't sound so evil because it's catchy as hell.
No, of course you have a heart!
No, Mary puts the Hart in heart.
Obviously someone is jealous of our close, professional relationship.
Perhaps I overreacted with the cranberries.
I'm... I'm sorry, are you apologizing?
But seeing this made me realize just how much I... appreciate you.
So, I want to make you an executive producer... as long as you find out who did this, publicly humiliate them, and fire them.
Tucker, hey!
Whatever you do, don't...
What's up, Mary?
Well, hello there, stranger.
Wait, why do you look so familiar?
What do you do here, Jason?
I make the melon balls.
Well, make them smaller next time.
It's bad for my face to chew.
Danny: Mom?
Mamacita.
Best mom in the world.
I was hoping we could have a little chat...
I was just sitting here thinking about you, and, you know, how amazing you've been during this painful, awful time.
You're not just my son.
And all my friends, you know, they complain that their kids never want to spend any time with them, but not me.
I always say, "I have the best son in the world."
- What about Ben?
Listen, honey.
I know that I have been very intrusive lately, but you have honestly saved my life.
You know I'd do anything for you, Mom.
And you know what would really help me?
Make me feel whole again?
I would just really love to go to that Mary Hart whatever-she-calls-it thing with you.
Wait, the SweetHart Special?
But I've only got two tickets and Riley's got her heart set on it.
I mean, we've got our costumes picked out and everything.
That is a problem... but I know you'll do the right thing.
Dude, I'm gonna get my own Tucker to scream at!
But don't you still have to find a fall guy and fire someone?
Oh, please. Believe me, I've got a list.
Enjoy your last stolen yogurt, Todd.
Payback for my applesauce, bitch.
What about Jason?
I have the advantage of actually being guilty and I don't actually work here, so no one actually gets hurt.
Yeah, that's genius!
After an extensive investigation I've traced the video to Jason's phone.
Well, Jason, why don't you just take that pretty face of yours and your melon baller and get out?
I can't believe we just got away with that, man!
We're geniuses!
I mean, Mary is kind of a moron, right?
I mean, like, a big, dumb blond.
That thing's not actually on, is it?
No. This?
Mary: Tucker!
Yeah, I guess it is on.
What flavor do you want your goodbye cake to be?
Man, I did not see that coming.
You shot the video, your kid posted it online, and it was your idea to fire Jason.
You were in charge of it coming.
Well, I worked in TV for one hour, and even I know how the headsets work.
I know how the headsets work, okay?
And I also know how friends work.
And if you weren't so busy trying to teach me some stupid lesson, none of this would have happened.
This is my career, Ben.
And you just destroyed it.
Oh, hey. How am I doing?
Funny you should ask.
Um, not well.
Because despite my talking about the Mary Hart Special for the last six months, I am now not going.
Am I supposed to have any idea what you're talking about?
Shiver me timbers!
Who's ready to hunt some dragons?
No one on Clash of Dragons has said that.
Is Danny ready?
This corset's got about four hours on it before m'ladies explode.
(giggles) Thanks for the ticket, Riley.
Your mom stole my boyfriend.
Uh, kind of the one woman I didn't think I'd have to worry about.
Well, Tucker gave me two tickets.
You can have 'em.
Well, will you go with me?
Because you can only get in if you're dressed as a famous couple from history.
Uh, well, won't me going with you make Danny...
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
And that's what us girlfriends call a win-win.
No, no, no. I can't. I can't.
Do you have any idea what Mary would do if she sees me?
I mean, after she hits on me of course.
She may not like my melon balls, but she definitely likes my...
You get the point.
That's genius!
I will go with you!
All right, what's a costume that we can do at the last minute?
Um, I've got a black wig and some 60s clothes.
Sonny and Cher?
Oh, my God, that's perfect!
Plus, they were great friends after their breakup, and you know, it's... it's just like us!
Yeah, so totally like us! Yeah!
How was I supposed to know you wanted to be Cher?
Uh, again, I'm gonna go with, "Really?"
And why are you with my brother?
I don't know, because Ben didn't dump me for his mother?
Because Ben is a true friend.
Because Ben would never abandon me.
Ben's gotta go.
See you later, Riles.
- Hey, Sonny.
Oh, hey, Riles.
Ever hear the expression,
"Two is company, three is a pathetic girl dressed as Cher with no partner"?
I found this costume on the couch.
Figured it was the perfect way to get past security.
Don't you work here?
Oh, when I'm done with this show, nobody is gonna work here.
It's time I got my dignity back.
Hey, Mary.
It's me, Jason.
I think we both know what I'm doing here.
I saw how you looked at me before.
Oh, you're here to seduce me just like the real Sonny did in '79.
You bet I am.
Should we lock the doors so your husband doesn't walk in on us?
Please, I've done this 100 times before and he never found out.
He's about as in the dark as the IRS is about my Swiss accounts.
Now... why don't you make a deposit at Infidelity Bank?
- Gotcha! - Mary:
I want you to give Tucker his job back unless you want this to get out too.
You know he deserves it.
He does everything to please you and all you've ever done is crush his spirit.
I actually need Tucker.
His little revenge video doubled the show ratings.
So he can have his job back?
Now put the mustache on and take me back to 1979.
Okay, SweetHarts, let's do this.
Oh, he was just here.
Sorry, couples only.
Desperate singles is next week.
If you could just give me a minute, he'll be right back.
- You two, you two, next.
Riley, I am so sorry.
Danny, come on!
The gay pirate boys are taking our seats!
As soon as this is over, I'm going to make it up to you.
Danny, come on!
She's just giving you a hard time.
- Can you give me a minute? - No, Danny.
It's fine.
Not now.
- Yeah, Danny. Not now.
- Mom, enough!
You've been controlling, bossy, and honestly, a pain in my neck.
I'm sorry that you're lonely, but you're not the woman that I love.
Riley is.
So, you need to back up out of my life and get your own.
Well, it's about time!
Both: What?
Danny, I have been in your face the last two days, trying to get you to push me away.
No man should let his mother come between him and the love of his life.
And no woman wants to be with a guy who can't stand up to his mother.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I was right about this corset and my m'ladies are about to blow, so...
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
How many times do I have to tell you to stop stealing my clothes?
It doesn't matter. I got great news.
So do I, man.
Look, I finally realized you were right.
This job, this humiliation, it's beneath me.
I am better than Mary Hart.
- I got your job back.
- Oh, my God! You did?
Man over speaker: And we're live in five seconds.
I slipped something to my buddy in the audio booth.
I gotta stop him.

Any chance it'll work again?
Hey, Mom, watch this.
Emma, it's time for bed.
Let's go put your pajamas on, okay?
Now who's standing up to a two-year-old?
All right, my little monkey.
There we go. All right.
Let's get your jammies on.
Here's your cookie, sweetheart.
I'm soon taking a fine new house, in Soho, Greek Street.
This move is too much risk.
Is your master in?
Mr. Lennox is my husband.
Harriet knows all about us.
You want me to invest in your house, and I shall.
I am in need of a girl.
A sweet, untouched hanging risk.
- Hello, sprat.
- I'm not a sprat anymore.
Have to keep myself pure for Lord Reptile.
Tell Dame Death Mary Cooper's dead.
Under normal circumstances, the Crown could fall, Christ could rise, and a gentleman would still find himself well met at the door of Margaret Wells, but today, we are closed.
Tomorrow we re-open in Greek Street.
But I must warn you.
Mrs. Wells has tweaked the tariffs in accordance.
More money for the same girls?
Way of the world, Mr. Armitage.
You can flog a sweetmeat for twice the price if it's in a pretty paper.
There'll be no "twice the price" coming our way.
Mr. Armitage is exactly the breed we don't want following us.
He's got lovely thick arms.
Better than Lord Repton's.
Weak and flabby from a life of opulence.
Better than his pintle.
Poor old wonky.
You're just jealous I'll be off gallivanting in splendor.
You're almost a proper lady, Lucy.
And you're almost a proper whore.
Can I not rely on you for better?
Do want the other girls to piss in your supper?
I was just joking, Ma.
There is an art to joking without putting yourself above 'em.
Am I not above them?
You make yourself the toast of the Reptons and they will catapult you to the heavens, just as they did Charlotte.
I don't want a life like Kitty and Fanny.
You... you are gold and they are pinchbeck.
Won't prove that by gloating.
The carriage!
Mrs. Lennox?
Nathaniel was stricken last night.
The doctor says his heart is failing him.
He wants you.
You must ride back with me now to see him.
You visit for more than the amusements,
Justice Cunliffe?
The beast requires feeding again.
If I knew the nature of the beast, how much better I could nourish it.
And procuring unused girls is perilous.
Are they worthy of the risk?
If this is you... who are they?
- Closer.
Though they are without heart.
I will depart, madam, before a stench like the fleet ditch reaches me.
Our business is not concluded.
You vile wretch!
You're more repulsive than the blackening corpse left on my doorstep.
It wasn't deliberate, Mumma, I think her belly is unsettled.
Then today you will fast so as not to upset your stomach further.
Forgive me, gentlemen!
"I support my right honorable friend's assertion that the cost of war has been grave."
This will be my first speech in Parliament and you're not even listening.
I'm hanging on your every word, my love.
I can't help thinking your wife would make a better audience.
Lady Caroline's a passionless shrew.
She wouldn't understand an artful performance if it fumbled her cockle.
I'm not asking you to understand the politics.
I understand that Parliament wants to tax the natives in the colonies to get back what was spent fighting them.
You make it sound unreasonable.
Then perhaps I do not understand it as well as I thought.
There a more straightforward performance you could show me?
Don't scratch it, or they'll dump you on the church steps.
You look so handsome, Lucy.
You won't be a bit out of place at the Reptons.
Old wonky.
I shall have to mount with care.
The men at the new house will love you, Fanny.
Master Benjamin is with him now.
The children!
Mama, Mama!
Come to me.
- I'm so sorry. - Is Papa with angels?
Our faces will not always fit as well as they have done here.
I won't mind moving to Greek Street.
I could use some luxury.
There'll be plenty of pockets to lighten.
Off you go, then.
Be seeing you!
Come visit us!
Yes, miss?
This is not the way to the Reptons'.
We're going to their country estate.
Do you hear me, I want you to stop.
I wasn't told I'd be leaving London.
If you will not take me home, then I will get out and make my own way.
And become the plunder of footpads?
It won't just be your purse they shove their fingers in.
Then I will take you.
But you will have to make good with me.
My mother will pay you as soon as we return.
You can take me in your mouth, if you prefer.
I'm a guest of your master.
You are not his guest, you are his doxy.
And you won't even be that once you've jilted him.
Have to drag 'em out their cannons.
I think you're on the wrong street, friend.
I'm sure I'm not, friend.
I said leave her alone!
Don't touch her!
Hay! Get your grubby fingers off her!
We've not come looking for trouble.
Well, then take your rancid bitches and your rabid little picaninny... and fuck off.
Filthy beast!
Next time, we won't be so merciful.
Fuck you, dead boy!
- You're disgusting.
- You are a trollop.
- Fucking oaf!
- You're a maggot boiler.
You're a maggot boiler, that's all you are!
You should be ashamed of yourself!
They are retreating.
Then our undertaking is accomplished.
By organizing a few mischief makers and a sack of slops?
They will return, and you will attach yourself to that house like a dog on a rope.
The gentlemen should be scared to pass you.
I am no dog, Mrs. Quigley.
I do hope you are not too proud for the task.
Because there are others I could install in this house.
And you could be back in your hovel.
You have not been born rich or fortunate enough to enjoy congress with the likes of me.
I do hope your journey was not too torturous, my dear.
I'm sure you'll want to bathe.
Scrub London from your skin.
I'm not really his wife.
His children are bastards.
You know if you're provided for?
You must check before Benjamin returns.
But what if I am not?
Then rectify it.
Commit a fraud?
Commit Nathaniel's wishes to paper, nothing more.
You do not have the luxury of compunction.
You've left me mid-game, old friend.
My freedom papers.
The greatest gift Nathaniel ever gave me.
They... they aren't signed.
Did he lie when he said I was free?
Fate smiles upon you.
Smile back.
- My condolences, master.
- My father is not yet cold.
You will not scavenge here today.
That sour tits will have me starved!
You bait the bear and then cry when it mauls you.
No food, no fancy.
I haven't the energy.
I'm throbbing.
Your hand will do.
Mine is limp with hunger.
Use your own.
She has spent this much already this year.
Lady Caroline, she has spent that much already this month.
She is like nothing I have ever known.
It is she who possesses him.
She is the wickedest harpy.
I'm here to surprise my husband upon his return.
It's not every day one makes one's debut in Parliament.
I watched Sir George rehearse his speech.
You are easily impressed.
My husband is a man child.
A fopdoodle who's frittering away my fortune.
In the eyes of the law, it is Sir George's fortune, of course, but in reality, it was gifted to me by prudent ancestors.
Marriage is the worst kind of thief.
Then you will be my ally.
In what?
In curbing Sir George's extravagance.
His finances are not my concern.
His estate falls into disrepair.
You are ruining him.
If you'll excuse me, Sir George has sent word.
His speech is delivered and he requires. Miss Wells's company.
Well, we'll send a message that you are here.
He will return at once.
We both know he will not.
You will excuse me while I dress?
But do take these with you.
They're yours, after all.
There's no need to hide yourself, Lucy.
And here... is a token.
A little doll for our little doll.
But she doesn't hold a candle to you.
Hurry and dress.
This afternoon, we hunt.
Hurry, we will be late.
Good... very good.
I am stuffing you full!
Full to bursting.
You've got to stop playing the jester.
Mumma once starved a girl for three days.
She didn't have a little Charlie to look after her, - did she?
- I'm not joking, Emily.
If you go at her too far, she'll give you Mr. Osborne.
And who is Mr. Osborne?
He's the short straw.
Confounded musket.
The sight ain't true.
Perhaps you should take a shot, Lucy.
Lord Repton will show you.
I can feel your heart fluttering like a little beast's.
Where's Lady Repton?
You'd better go to her.
You'd better run, girl, she might need your help.
Quickly, now!
You'd better run, Lucy.
We can see you, Lucy.
We're following your little trail.
The dogs are off the leash, Lucy!
Not far now.
That's it... run, girl!
Your first kill.
Margaret will solve it.
She's clever as a cat.
Hisses like one too.
We'll leave them to it, girls.
Don't start, Margaret.
How could you abandon that house?
You've watched me fight tooth-and-claw for it.
We were ambushed.
Fanny was practically frigged in front of me.
- You could have fought.
- I did fight!
What, with all your passion?
I'd have ripped the sinews from their necks before I walked away from my house.
Well, I'm not like you, Margaret.
I can't wear blinkers to the cost of it all.
What cost?
The cost to Jacob, to Lucy.
- The cost to all of us.
- Would you have Lucy rut her days away as a bawdy house whore?
Or better still, some smock-wife to a penniless laborer?
And what about Jacob?
Shall we teach him to crawl on his belly as some rich man's boy?
I am weary of doing this alone.
You do it alone?
Sometimes I feel I do.
I'll tell you what you're alone in, woman.
The noxious squabble with Lydia Quigley that you're too puffed-up to finish.
What's that got to do with anything?
You think those louts paid for themselves?
It's payback for Mary Cooper.
Don't add stupidity to the list of your misdeeds, Margaret.
Plenty long enough already.
Nathaniel Lennox.
He was a slave owner, Mags.
He's chosen the worst moment to die.
You pretend it's only your pocket feels the ache.
I remember sometimes you tupped him for free.
You should have slapped me for my foolishness.
His wife said he got lusty about me on his death bed.
Filthy dog.
His prick was stiff before the rest of him.
I wonder if Will won't dance a jig when my time comes.
It'll be your own fault, you nipping crab.
You've forgotten he's the only man you've never made pay for it.
Tell me, how can I get into Greek Street?
You've a very solemn countenance today, Miss Wells.
Why don't you join me and I'll see if I can rectify it?
Alas, I'm summoned to service my master.
He'd have you pleasure him in public?
Only with words.
It's harlotting we do with our clothes on that matters most.
Charlotte!
Why are you loitering?
To warn you in private that Haxby conspires against you.
He summoned Lady Caroline to curb your spending.
The impertinent gargoyle!
He picked the wrong fellow if he thinks that George Howard will be enfeebled.
Well, he has indeed.
Sir Christopher.
Did my lord acquit himself well in the House today?
He was... masterful.
Later, you shall master me.
Lord Howard, I am throbbing with envy.
You take our mischief in the woods very timidly, Lucy.
Where's that Wells wild streak I'm so fond of?
Have you no retort?
Sir, you are too cruel.
She's not yet out of her shell.
I'm sure Charlotte Wells never had a shell.
Lord Repton should be careful I don't tell everyone he didn't hit a target all day.
He should indeed.
Every shot he made was wonky.
I shall call him Lord Wonky.
This fricassee is delicious.
Off to bed, off to bed.
Come, come on, hold on to my arm.
What is it, Mama?
Hold on to my arm... Quiet, quiet!
Stealing away like a thief when I was coming to bring you these.
You've signed them.
To release myself from my father's depravity.
- I wasn't sure you would.
The deed grants you your own liberty.
It doesn't extend to the children.
So we're not free at all?
You are free.
- I won't leave them.
- The choice isn't yours.
Abigail, the children.
No, it's... no, you...
No, you can't keep them!
I don't intend to.
They will have most value to me on the plantation.
No!
- Mama! No, please, Benjamin.
Please, Benjamin, no.
You will go.
We're not shy of men, what are you doing?
Fighting, Margaret, like I always did.
You are returned with your organ grinder.
Get him, boys!
Nancy, go on, Nancy, get him!
Get him, girl!
Keep away from the cart!
Piece of shit!
Run for the watch, girl, as though your life depends upon it!
Yes, Mother!
We shall retire.
Have you ever laid with a man after insulting his manhood?
He will pound you to tripe.
What devilment is this?
We're new tenants, sir, set upon by villains as we're trying to move in.
She is a filthy bawd.
Our masters don't want her here.
She's a hellcat!
Then your masters will take it up with her landlord, or the King of England himself.
But you rogues will move on.
All right, clear the way, or I'll...
There's a fine fellow now.
Get out of here, you piece of shit.
You heard the man.
- Move off.
- Yeah, go home.
Right, let's get this gear off.
My lady has sent me to dress you, miss.
Soaked into the wood.
How long you been down there?
We'll never be free of the stench.
We haven't got enough beds or girls to fill the place.
What if I've brought a scourge upon us?
What if the stench is me?
You have brought a scourge upon us.
Lydia Quigley.
The stench, that's Mary Cooper.
- I can't do this, Will.
- Well, that's too bad.
This is the course you set us upon.
The girls will soon awake.
The culls will arrive.
Culls might not come.
In which case, the lack of beds will not be a problem.
And once she had got inside, did Margaret Wells emerge again?
Only her bully man, dragging' out the sack.
No doubt filled with what you left them.
You have a better play than that.
The skill is knowing which card your adversary holds.
Mr. Osborne is here, Mumma.
It's Mary-Louise's turn and she's disappeared.
Well, take him to Emily Lacey.
Miss Lacey.
Mr. Osborne for you.
What if nobody co...
The tits come to the lard.
I have no home, no money, and I wouldn't care if only I had my children.
I would rather be dead than be without them.
If they're slaves, then surely they're for sale.
You will buy them back.
All I can do is pay you what I pay another girl.
I can never be a whore.
A kitchen maid.
Work for me, and you'll go to bed every night knowing you have worked.
You forget I was a slave, Mrs. Wells.
Lucy's home.
The journey from the country took hours.
You left London?
It was astounding, Ma.
Haxby?
Don't let him squirm off the hook, Howard.
Haxby!
I need the piss pot.
I'll summon the maid.
No, I have the piss pot.
What I require is a menial to hold it.
- Hold my piss pot, Haxby.
You think because your family have been with the estate for generations that I'm forced to endure you, like an ugly old heirloom.
Meddle again and I'll kick you out in the street like a dog.
My wife will snivel for all of five minutes and then she'll forget you.
Because a servant is just a servant.
Hide your faces, harlots!
And damned are the weak and wayward men who would indulge in fornication.
This temple of vice will burn to its very cinders.
You're welcome here always, Mr. Armitage, and at your usual rate.
Less, if you can extract that eyeless tumor from the doorstep.
And if I don't have Fanny Lambert right this moment, I might die a death of wanting.
She was a treat before.
But in that new dress... You have buttered the bacon, Mrs. Wells!
Hide your faces, harlots!
Hide them in very shame.
But the severest damnation be reserved, for it is she who provides both instrument and opportunity for vice.
Is this how you welcome your new neighbor, Mrs. Scanwell?
I bid you no welcome, flesh-peddler.
Your mistress is also a bawd.
It is Pimp Quigley that set you upon me, - is it not?
- God alone is my master.
I am a good Samaritan here to warn you that your mistress will lead you to the bonfire if you let her.
Her soul is three shades blacker than your skin.
Mother is fearlessly fighting your campaign, but... her health is not strong.
And Mrs. Wells just mocked us with scorn.
She feasts like a rat on a corpse pile but she will become bloated and complacent.
Do not falter in your campaign, my dear.
Then we can stay in your house?
What a jewel you are.
Your mother's very fortunate to have you.
Your mother tells me you play.
I'd love to hear you.
Does your hand trouble you?
Then unfurl it.
Mr. Byrne?
I don't think she likes me.
There's a rotten smell in here, Ma.
I'm trying to fix it.
Before I take this test... willingly, I might add... you want to tell me who you really are, Edie?
"U.S. Piss"?
"USPIS." It rhymes with "justice."
It rhymes with "juspice."
The United States Postal Inspection Service is the oldest law-enforcement agency in America, created by one Benjamin Franklin.
- Ever heard of him? - No.
Then I guess you guys don't go to Broadway.
It's only the hottest ticket in town for like a year.

Yes, massa!
Didn't "Schoolhouse Rock" do this like 40 years ago?
I don't know what they're applauding, the anachronisms or the shitty rap.
Oh, yeah, we saw that.
It was just a little overrated.
It won 14 Tonys!
How many Tonys have you won? !
_
Smell that head.
Aww. Yeah, it's not the smell of the head you love.
It's the smell of talc you love.
Babe, are we sure we don't want another one?
Isn't it a little late?
I thought you already got your vasectomy.
No, I got my consultation.
There's a one-month waiting period in New York.
Yeah, it's to prevent buyer's remorse.
Yeah. More like pliers remorse.
Hey. What are you guys talking about?
Well, uh, we were just discussing
- your father's vasectomy.
- Every man should get one.
Why is it always up to the woman to get it?
We don't do enough pushing a 10-pound bowling ball out of our vagina?
We've had some frank talks.
This shit should be on TBS.
Oh, my God. This family is too funny.
Hey, show her the part where the boy gets his first hand job from the girl next door.
Please, don't tell me you watched that.
_
It's going everywhere!
It won't stop!
Well, you know what, that actually wasn't the funny part.
It was the dad's sock.
And he didn't know what it was.
And he was like, "What is this?
Shampoo?"
What's shampoo doing in my sock?"
And then he started sniffing it.
This isn't some raunchy sitcom we're watching!
This is two months of surveillance footage trying to connect this family to USPIS enemy number one... the goddamn Big Tuna! Wow!
Okay. That's so intense.
You do realize we're just the mail police, right?
You, outside!
The mail is a lot more dangerous than you think.
You know, maybe male predators, but not mail predators. You know what I mean?
Let me educate you, rook.
14 USPIS members have been killed in the line of duty.
Like 1776?
14 is too many.
And eight of those were suicides.
Because this job was so rough on them, it pushed them to end it all.
We have exactly one month to get something approaching collusion on this woman, or else this operation is in for a world of trouble.
Oh! I found that clip.
Oh, that's familiar.
It's my favorite socks.
- It's not shampoo.
No, it's... it's, like, right on the tip of my tongue.
- Focus, please! - What?
- You've been out of time.
Yeah, you were out of time like five minutes ago.
I hate to say it, but they seem like a perfectly normal family.
All right, what is this?
Bank deposit, garbled.
It appeared a couple times in the transcripts.
He's making a deposit, big deposit.
He's uncomfortable.
He thought they were past this part of their life.
He says, "Why this bank?"
She's like, "Well, it's across the street" from that Vietnamese place I like... very discreet."
Looks like it's time for a good old-fashioned stakeout.
Boom. Target is active.
Vietnamese, Hasids.
Best guess is diamond smuggle.
Excelsior Cryobank.
Uh, I'm here to, um... uh, make a deposit.
Fifth floor, down the hall.
Yeah. I mean, you were literally just talking to someone.
Wait for the buzzer, please. Just...
He's having a little trouble, there.
Yeah, you buzzed but it didn't open.
Are you pushing, sir?
- This guy's an idiot. - Just push the door.
Should we follow him?
No. Hang tight.
We're after her.
You're gonna go into room five.
There's a 15-minute time limit.
Why is there a time limit?
This isn't a peep show.
No, I didn't think it was.
I'm just... I'm... I'm only doing this for my wife.
You know, she wants the baby option on the table.
I'm getting a vasectomy, so...
Don't forget your cup.
Why is it so big?
Some men can be very productive.
What the...
Jesus. Sir.
Five.
I like that sweater.
I think it makes me look boxy.
They only had it in a medium.
I was thinking about returning it... to the store where I got it.
Come on, get to it.
No, you need to [Bleep]
Ooh, yeah. Ew! What is this?
This is a long conversation that we need to have.
Oh, my God. Are you still talking?
Lookin' to get some?
Then take it off, then.
- Oh! - That's all you go?
- Oh! - You can take more off.
I like a little reemo between my chemo.
This is not really my thing.
Why would you think I'd be into this?
This is no one's type.
"Pubes and Lube"?
"Hydra"... "Big Nasty Rabbits Take"...
Who would...
A lobster?
This is all so niche.
Look, we can't pay for everyone's sexual whims, all right?
There's a lot out there.
No one could get off to this stuff.
That's... That's...
Don't you just have girls playing volleyball or something?
Hey. You done already?
No, I'm not done.
The porn here is way too intense for me.
So go to the volleyball site you always go to.
I don't go to the volley...
- Nate. - Okay, fine.
It's only 'cause they make them wear the spandex.
- It's... I don't... - I don't care.
I tried to go, but I put the Net Nanny on the phone,
- and now I forgot the password.
- Reset your phone.
I haven't backed it up in a while. I don't want to lose pictures, you know.
Baby, you have to back it up every week.
Can you just do me a favor and, like... talk sexy to me?
No. I'm at the spa.
With the children.
Stop! It's tickling me!
Hey, what if I sexted you? Would that work?
No! That doesn't work for anybody.
Okay. Hold on. Watch this.
Is that a peach?
But it's... it's supposed to be something else.
What, a nectarine?
God, you're literal.
Why would you send me a... Why would you send me a picture of a camel?
Humping.
Please just say something like "I'm gonna [Mutters] you tonight"?
Oh, yeah. Whew. Oh, you like that, right?
How do you like it?
You like it a lot?
Yeah, I do, actually.
- Oh, God. - Pretty good.
Oh, that's so good. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Sorry. Watch the bunion.
Hey, is that Dad on the phone?
- I want to talk to him! - What? No.
Hi, Dad! I was getting my foot pumiced, and dead skin was flying everywhere.
- It looked like it was snowing. - Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, tell him about my mouth!
Dad, it got all in my mouth!
Hey, hey. Give me the phone.
I'll meet you in the lobby. I'll take care of this.
Is it on?
Oh, it's on.
Get mine.
- Hey, which one is it?
Can you...? Yeah, I'm gonna push... I'm just pushing them.
Just cover up. Just cover up.
- What do you want? - Gary, that you? Why can't she go in the room with me?
You said it wasn't a peep show.
Well, it's not a brothel, either.
This is a weird-ass bank.
I am not going in the bathroom.
- This is so gross.
- Take your pants off.
- Yeah. Slow down.
- Well, I know, but my nails aren't done, and I got to get back.
- Take 'em off. - Okay. All right?
- Sorry. - Jesus.
- Can you...?
You know, show me that or something?
- My tits? - I wasn't gonna call them that.
Well, what do you want to...
I mean, you've seen it. I don't...
- I'm sorry. - I'm not... It's a dirty bra.
It doesn't just go up on its own. Yes. Go.
Just look in there.
It's nothing you haven't seen. - Okay.
All right. That started it.
- That did it?
Well, it started it.
You got to finish it
. You want me to do it?
That's why I called you.
I thought you just wanted company.
Well, don't roll your eyes.
I was just breathing.
I had hummus. Just...
Yeah. Oh, that's fast.
Don't critique.
- Okay. I need like 20 more minutes.
I told you, I've been working on my tolerance.
- NATE: We can just move past the whole... - He brought it up.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You okay?
No. Hey, don't let this get you down, okay?
We've gone three times over budget, we've broken like 10 U.S. laws, and we're not even close to finding the Big Tuna.
No. Hey, look at me. Look at me.
It is. I'm the commanding officer.
Say I went rogue.
Did... Did you just finish?
Um... God, you have a problem.
Well, my girlfriend says it's not a big deal.
It is a big deal. It's a very big deal.
Oh, hey, I have an idea. What if we just brought them in?
Uh, I'm not done talking about this yet.
What if we just brought them in for a good old-fashioned interrogation?
She's never gonna give up the Big Tuna.
How do you know unless you try?
If we brought them in, we'd have 13 hours to break them, tops.
Perfect. Separate them. Divide and conquer.
They're terrible when they're apart.
- Let's do it. - Awesome.
_
Oh, God. Why am I doing this?
'Cause it's important to your daughter.
Just take a couple extra painkillers and take it easy.
When do I ever take it easy, okay?
And besides "Fun Walk"?
That doesn't rhyme.
I'm gonna run.
I'm gonna win.
Hey. There are no winners.
It's just to raise awareness for spaying and neutering your service animals.
God, talk about a first-world charity.
This guy knows a little something about being neutered.
Shhhhh... Why would you do...
! - It was funny.
- It wasn't funny!
I had a vasectomy three hours ago!
This means so much to me!
Okay. Okay, sweetie.
I know. I know. Just too sore for hugs.
Just think about it. As soon as you cross that finish line, it's unprotected sex for the rest of your life.
Stop touching my balls!
I want them brought in quiet, and I want them brought in fast.
Do not draw attention to yourselves.
Um... What branch of the government are you guys with?
"U.S. Piss."
No. It's "USPIS."
It's "us," like "we."
Like "we..." like "we-PIS."
They piss.
Okay, you know what? Just go.
Thanks. Just had a vasectomy.
Lap three!
Yeah. Where'd you get that bike from?
It's a fun run!
Hurry up, slow poke!
I'm already on my second lap.
'Cause you're on a skateboard!
Where did you get these things from?
Whoa! Yeah, no. No way, brother.
I'm not getting lapped by a guy in a costume.
Whoo! God damn it, he's fast.
Do you have the catch?
I repeat, do you have the catch?
We'll circle back, pick him up at the finish.
Mother f'ing...
Hey, hey, hey, hey. It'll be fine.
Oh, do not tell me to relax... ever.
Look. Hey, it just seems like you're a little tense, all right?
I'm such a shit show.
It's all right. All right? Hey.
You see your father?
Oh! Oh, there he is!
Oh, Nate! Nate! You're so close!
Fun run.
Come on! - Come on!
You got this!
Oh! Why do you keep doing that?
How you doing, babe?
I got a little emotional out there.
- You did? - Yeah.
Aw, why?
Just knowing that this part of our life, which is so great, is coming to an end.
- Yeah. - No more kids.
It's a little sad.
That's why I had you put some on ice.
I knew you weren't quite ready to be done with it.
I came by the bird's nest to sweep up, and guess who's knocking on their door?
- Big Bird.
Big Tuna!
100%. Perfect match.
Abort! I repeat, abort!
We are fully committed now!
Pull back! I repeat, abort!
We have bigger fish to fry.
We are 10 feet from the target.
Hey, man. You talking about me?
There is no cover.
Uh, does he see you?
Of course he sees me!
He's waving!
Don't wave back.
Not much. What's up with you guys?
I think I know what this is about.
Yeah. It's supposed to be a fun run, and I'm out there acting like a jackass.
I just get a little carried away.
It was the drugs, I think.
If it makes you feel any better, I think I came in last place.
- You did. - Okay.
Little consolation prize.
That's a pretty sweet costume, dude.
Yeah. That gun looks very real. It really does.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, it looks a little too real. Oh, my God.
You should get one of those orange-rubber tips on there. Yeah, seriously. Let me see that.
- I mean, look at that, Nate. - Oh, Jesus.
Look at that, man. Wow
It's so authentic. And it's really solid. Yeah.
Yeah, you better not get caught by the real cops.
They will shoot you.
But seriously, uh, no hard feelings, huh?
- Great costume, though. - Same to you guys.
Yeah. Get a lighter one if you want to beat me next time. Sorry.
Wow. Did they run with their guns?
They didn't even finish.
How did that son of a bitch get the file?
He just gave me the copies.
Which you were going to publish.
A quarter to six!
Wake up, this ain't a vacation!
Ten minutes for showering!
Get up, people!
Get up, people!
- Gastón!
- Yasolórzano.
Miguel!
Céspedes, Céspedes.
Enrique!
Contreras Vidal.
Stand up.
Button up that shirt, this ain't a party.
One more infraction, and you'll spend a month in isolation.
Joaquín!
Guzmán Loera.
Five minutes for breakfast.
One hour in the courtyard.
Time to eat!
Silence!
Good night, Quique.
Good night, Professor Rubén.
Get up, this ain't a vacation!
Out of your cells!
Backs against the wall, eyes down.
Don't look!
I heard you've been crying at night.
- No, what?
If I find out you're crying and the other inmates can't sleep... I'll make you cry for a month in isolation.
- Yes, sir.
- Got it?
In this prison, you can only eat... sleep... and breathe.
My daughter told me she had sent more letters.
They never gave them to me.
Sons of bitches.
Is security always this tight?
Everything is forbidden here, Chapo.
Even dying.
One line.
Empty your bag.
This stays here.
Take off your ring, earrings, and glasses.
Go on.
I've been searched twice.
It's procedure.
If you refuse, there's the door.
Stand there, please.
You can't bring blue pens.
Excuse me? I said you can't bring blue pens.
Miss, I've done everything you've asked.
It's no coincidence they're not letting you see your mom.
It's one of their games, Chapo.
They want to break you.
How are the kids, and how's Mom?
Everyone's fine.
They want to know how you are.
Any news on Toño and Chío?
They're in another cell block, but that's all I know.
Did you talk to the person who promised me a bigger cage?
All I can do for you... is move you to another penitentiary. A friendlier one.
He will keep his promise, but he says you have to wait.
Years.
A few, at least.
JOURNALIST GABRIELA SAAVEDRA MURDERED IN STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES
Let's take a walk.
Where?
Keep driving straight.
Has anyone made a friend here?
Do you mean the guards?
No. They're watched all the time.
Their schedule changes almost every single day.
What about the doctor?
The cooks?
Same thing.
The Lawyer changes their schedule.
Who's the Lawyer?
She's in charge of the prison.
Wait, I thought De Tavira was in charge?
He only handles the administrative stuff.
The Lawyer controls the daily stuff.
She's a criminal protected by the law.
Don't mess with her, Chapo.
All new houses have flaws.
I just need you to find one so I can focus on it.
General Blanco's body was found this morning.
He was one of the most important men in the Federal Judicial Police in our country.
It is believed to be a robbery.
The president is saddened by this tragic event and demands a thorough investigation.
General Blanco was my mentor, sir.
I'll help you find the perpetrators, no matter what.
Thank you, Conrado.
Let's keep his family informed.
Of course.
What did you do to end up here?
Ask my lawyer if you don't believe me.
And you, Professor? What did you do?
We blocked a road with my comrades.
We were protesting.
The government considers it a federal crime.
They treat us worse than they treat you drug lords.
You really don't want to know, Chapo.
The new house has got a fat cat.
Do you know him?
The fattest cat?
His kitten's been sick for some time.
They don't have money to take her to the vet.
I can pay for your girl's treatment.
No dinner for Guzmán.
I need sleeping pills.
The doctor used to give us those.
But the Lawyer banned them.
We feel you, Chapo.
We can't sleep either.
But you're new here, Chapo.
With the punch you took, you should ask see the doc.
Maybe he'll give you something.
If they catch you, they'll fuck you up.
Good night, Professor Rubén.
Good night, Chapo.
You can't have pills without the doctor's authorization.
Who gave them to you?
You're going to the padded room.
No, please, no!
Please... beat me!
Take my food!
But, please, don't send me there, I'm begging you, please...
I'm begging you, please!
Please, I'm begging you!
Don't do this!
Don't send me there!
Please, don't!
Samuel.
What's the padded room?
You sent him there.
Watch your mouth, asshole.
Rubén was brave enough to be quiet.
Don't you be the one who snitches.
They'll hear us.
Quique here is scared out of his fucking mind.
What's the padded room, Quique?
The worst punishment, Chapo.
- Lunch time.
- I'm not eating.
Lunch time.
I'm staying here.
The Lawyer would like to remind you you have to follow the rules here.
Not eating breaks the rules.
Quique.
Have you ever been where Rubén is?
Just a couple of days.
And I don't ever wanna go back.
If the rooms weren't padded, one would hurt themselves out of desperation.
My daughter got worse.
Darling...
I'm sitting there.
I've been praying for you every day.
Look at you.
Don't worry, mom.
I'm tough as nails.
Chapo says you owe him.
How long until Rubén is back?
A couple of nights, and the punishment will be over.
Rubén.
You're loyal.
I owe you.
- Professor.
- What are you doing?
- He's hanging himself!
- He's hanging himself!
Let me die. Let me die.
Put him back in his cell. Watch him 24/7. I don't want him doing something stupid.
Let me die... Please...
Take him to the doctor.
Help him like I helped your daughter, asshole!
You're such a tough guy...
Take him to isolation.
This is no place to sleep.
Step back, you reek.
If you want me to read you the letter, step back.
It's from your old lady.
She says she really loves you.
But she has needs, and the wait is long.
So she's already fucking some other asshole.
That's life, Chapo.
Wait!
I'm the Deputy Director of this prison.
You've spent a month in the padded cell because I gave the order.
I'll decide whether you stay in there or not.
Let me ask you just one question.
Do you promise to live a different life?
Do you agree that so much luxury, money, and power was a mistake?
You can look me in the eyes to answer me.
Yes, Deputy Director. I promise I've changed.
Take him back, one more month.
Wait, Ma'am!
I'll take revenge!
Be harsher with your discipline.
Make it clear to him that he's in Almoloya.
Turn it off!
I have a stomachache.
I have a stomachache!
I have a stomach ache!
Deputy Director.
El Chapo has not been eating for several days and he says he has a stomachache.
Take that off and tak a shower.
I left you a clean uniform.
Lay down on your back.
If you tell them it's serious, I'll pay you a shitload of money.
- I can pay you a lot. - How much?
You set the price.
You just have to convince them to take me back to my cell.
The pain will go away if you eat.
Do me the favor, doc.
A message from the Deputy Director.
For trying to bribe the doctor, you've just won yourself two more months in here, asshole.
No, please, no! No!
I'll do whatever you want!
Take me out of here!
Deputy Director, I swear I've changed!
Deputy Director!
Deputy Director! I swear I won't live like I used to.
Keep pressuring Mr. Guzmán.
I want to know everything he says or does.
Give me what's in your pockets.
No.
It's just a thread.
Do you think you are the first one to try this?
You're counting the days to see when you're out, right?
You just have to ask me.
Chapo... you'll never leave this place, son of a bitch.
Deputy Director, Joaquín Guzmán has once again attacked the authorities of this prison.
Very good, Chapo.
Take good care of your plants.
Mr. Pedro will need more opium gum.
I think these will do for two more harvests.
You're better at this than your dad.
I'll get the same or more with the other two harvests.
Great, my son.
Go hide it.
You thought I wouldn't find out about the money from the harvest?
I earned it.
It's mine, not yours.
Who taught you how to farm it, you ungrateful punk!
Joaquín.
Joaquín.
Son, go and get your father.
Get away from the car.
This car needs to be properly cleaned and waxed.
I can do it.
You can name the price.
I can even clean the interior.
There's some buckets and water there.
Son of a bitch!
Come on, Pancho! Get in!
Get out, son of a bitch!
Come on! Pancho, get in the car!
Come on, punk!
Did you want to steal my car, fucking punk?
I only wanted to go for a ride and see how it felt to drive such a car.
I wouldn't steal from you, Mr. Pedro.
I want to have that same car.
That's why I want to work for you.
You go for a ride in my car, and now you're asking for work?
Joaquín Guzmán.
But everybody calls me El Chapo.
You're the one who is taking good care of the poppy field?
- Then you're already working for me.
No, Don Pedro,
I can do much more than just taking care of the fields.
I want to do more.
If you want to join me, you've got to earn it.
Tell me what to do. What do I have to do to earn myself a place?
There's someone who is stealing money from me.
I can't stand those things.
I bet he won't do it.
I bet he will.
Have you used one before?
You're going to lose the bet, buddy.
Chapo, what's up?
Damn it! You did better than I thought.
You killed him!
Welcome to my organization.
Tomorrow we'll go to Culiacán.
- You're coming with me.
- Thank you, Don Pedro.
Now go and have some fun.
Enjoy the party.
Hold this.
Take this.
The guys at the back, the ones all dressed up, are the DEA guys.
The guys standing over there are the politicians.
Be careful with them.
They're the real assholes.
Those guys are the military men.
They take care of the fields and watch our backs.
No crooked games with them.
- Your package, boss.
- Let me see.
Look! Fresh from the ocean, just as we like it!
For all of you to eat!
Long live Don Pedro!

When you have money... you have power.
When you have power... everybody wants to be with you.
Your mom says you're going to work for Pedro Avilés in Culiacán.
Don't pack, you're not going anywhere.
You're just going to be one more servant to a drug lord.
Just a fucking servant.
I'm going to have more power than anybody else.
I'm going to become the most powerful drug lord.
Did you get that?
I can swear on that!
Four months locked up.
Surely that was enough.
You've behaved.
Take him to his cell.
Chapo.
We thought you were dead.
5:45!
You're not on vacation!
Rubén was never himself again.
They took him to a special area.
Chapo.
They keep you all these months in isolation?
Contreras Vidal.
Permission to speak, sir.
Is it true that there is community work in the prison?
I'd like to work. Anything is fine.
I tell the Deputy Director who deserves to work and who doesn't.
Believe it or not, it's like a prize.
Adrián.
Velázquez Saavedra.
Where should I put the bags?
Container in the backyard.
I came every two weeks.
They didn't let me see you.
I filed defense statements, but it was useless.
- Hello.
What's up, buddy?
How are they treating you?
Do you remember the party we had for Mr. Palomino?
Yes, of course I remember.
Could you please organize a similar party?
This time is for Lora's wife.
She's a nice girl and she's been helping him out a lot.
Please, help me with that.
I won't hurt you, buddy.
I'll reward you if you do as I say.
I'm going to escape.
Joaquín, unless they transfer you to another prison... escaping is impossible.
I'm going to escape using the trucks that enter though the back gate.
We need a false floor in the truck.
And we need to bribe the driver, the loaders, and the guards.
Ask Ismael for the money.
Joaquín, this is crazy.
I don't care how long it takes me, I'm going to be free again.
C5, keep I3 in red.
Message received.
Are you going to open the door?
You're very naive if you think I trust people.
Everything is being monitored, Mr. Guzmán.
That's why nobody can escape from Almoloya.
Take him back to isolation.
♪ You may say you never loved me ♪
With or without money ♪
♪ I always do what I want ♪
Do you wanna call your daddy? Yeah, I wanna tell him I'm okay.
Okay.
Lizzy, be careful of your husband.
I can only lead you to the truth.
I can't make you believe it.
She's calling herself jolene parker.
Elizabeth keen is not your wife, she's your target.
You've been threatening to tell me the truth about my husband
Since the day we met. And I'm ready to listen.
Right now, the only thing that matters Is the immediate threat, your husband,
Finding out who he is and who he works for.
The rest will come.
Asset on board. En route.
12 cc's epinephrine.
45 seconds.
We need more adrenaline.
Cover her mouth.
You're okay.
Rest.
You'll be in america by morning.
We're taking you to washington dc.
Do you know where the prisoner was transported to?
Ah, washington. Okay.
Yeah, we'll take care of it.
Since when did jolene parker's case Go from missing person to murder investigation? And have you seen my keys?
Crazy, right? Yeah.
What, uh...
Police say they have a person of interest.
Who is it?
Isn't it possible that she just left town? Like she said, move to dayton?
They found blood.
Matches hers.
You see this stuff every day,
You know, people getting hurt and killed.
And I don't, and it freaks me out.
Just the thought of that happening to you, you know...
Just promise me you're as careful as you can be when you're at work.
The desk. By the computer.
That's where I saw your keys.
I'm going to give myself a tardy slip.
Found 'em!
They were under the newspaper.
What would I do without you? I gotta run.
Uh, tonight, for dinner,
Let's check out that new thai place.
He knows something's off.
What makes you say that? I can feel it.
I know him.
Tom is on his heels.
He's behaving erratically.
He killed jolene parker.
I felt if I told you it would inform your behavior with him.
I found her body, called the police And reported a missing person. I was confident that in the course of their investigation,
They would reach out to you and tom. And they did.
Jolene parker undoubtedly worked for the same organization as tom.
In what capacity, I have no idea.
If they worked together why would he murder her?
Perhaps he was ordered to.
Or perhaps he's just Out of control, irrational.
Paranoid and reactionary.
He's scrambling for a foothold. And therein lies our opportunity, to wait and to watch.
But tom is not the reason I'm here.
I'm afraid there's something quite timely afoot.
The pavlovich brothers are back in town.
You're talking about the team from the bridge That grabbed the general's daughter. They're an extraction team.
Cut their teeth on milosevic's protective detail
During the ethnic cleansing of the yugoslav wars.
We lost six of our men that day.
To the best of our knowledge, The pavlovich brothers have no political agenda.
They specialize in snatch-and-grabs Ranging from kidnap and ransom To extracting political dissidents.
Reddington says he has a contact, A money launderer sourced by the brothers,
Claims they're coming after a chinese scientist named xiaoping li.
What do we know about her?
Eighteen hours ago the agency sent an undercover team To extract her from a clandestine labor camp in the yunnan province. Break her out.
Why?
She's an immunologist.
Specializes in viral and bacterial diseases.
Four months ago she signaled to one of our assets That she had a willingness to talk about a secret weapons program.
A month later she was jailed for treason. She's scheduled to land at andrews in under an hour.
We have a team standing by to escort her to langley for a debriefing.
We gotta assume that the pavlovich brothers already know the route.
Well, then we'll re-route her. Bring her here.
Coordinate the adjustment with langley.
This way.
What's going on?
They said I'd be safe once I arrived.
We have a credible threat you're being targeted.
As a precaution, we've altered our route.
Get up to the chopper.
Donald ressler. Fbi.
Where's the asset?
Ground transport's been arranged. Negative.
Evac's been compromised.
Moving to beta protocol.
All right. Okay, copy that.
Anne arundel county sheriff's department Is reporting a downed aircraft burning two miles outside of crofton.
There's no witnesses on the ground.
We do have units en route.
It's gotta be the dump site on this chopper.
They knew cia protocol.
That if he routes were compromised they'd send in air support.
They snuck in and they're gonna sneak out.
We should coordinate with homeland, get their faces everywhere.
Agent malik, you want to tell me why The director of national intelligence is calling?
What don't I know about this case?
The program li was working on, it's germ weaponry.
Banned by nearly every nation on earth.
It's called whitefog.
The day before she was jailed, xiaoping li sent a message Indicating that she had access to the designs.
If she did, and she shared those with us, That would represent the biggest intelligence coup in a decade.
A germ warfare program?
That's why the chinese can't turn this Into an international incident.
Where are you? Busy.
The brothers.
They took xiaoping li.
How do you know?
Do you have a lead?
Something we can...
Your husband is not in school. Wait.
Where is he?
Meet me at 9th and constitution.
Reddington says he has a lead on the brothers.
Wants to talk.
Let me know what ntsb says about that downed aircraft.
He called in sick this morning.
Returned home briefly before making a stop At the radford bank in adams-morgan.
He's made three phone calls, all from pay phones.
He's been sitting at that cart for nearly an hour.
I'm sorry, lizzy.
This must be difficult.
You wanna know what's hard?
Sitting here when all I really want to do Is get my hands around his throat.
Shouldn't we follow him?
We are.
They all work for you.
Lizzy.
Wait.
The boat.
How long for the boat?
No. Please.
Tom? I'm in the dining room.
Where did you get that thing?
Found it in the basement.
That's where that was.
I'd been looking for it.
My father gave it to me.
It's in great condition, too.
Looks almost new.
Why haven't I seen this before?
Your pot is gonna boil over.
I thought we were going out for thai.
Yeah, well, I just thought it might be nice, you know,
To stay home alone.
You know billy salter, he was acting up again.
'cause his mom keeps packing these fruit roll ups And they give him this satanic sugar high, you know, so...
Oh. I did stop by the national archives. Just to maybe book a field trip for the kids.
Its funny, I, uh....
I could have sworn that I saw you there.
There was a woman there and she looked just like you.
Ah. No, I wish.
I was cooped up in the office all day.
Should have known.
Well, whoever she was, She could not have been half as beautiful as you are right now.
All right. Keep stirring.
I'm gonna walk the dog.
Come on, bud. Hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.
Yes, you're a good boy. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
Come on, bud.
Who's a good boy?
You're a good boy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How may I direct your call?
Hi, I'm having a problem with my account.
Number's delta, sierra, four, five, one.
Proceed. Mockingbird knows.
Requesting immediate evac.
Your husband never existed.
Lizzy, I understand why you went after tom today.
The instinct to jump in is...
But it isn't going to serve you well here.
And from the emotional point of view this must feel like An extraordinary violation and betrayal,
But for tom it was business.
Do you know we had sex the other night?
Do you have any idea how filthy that makes me feel? Unfortunately, lizzy, you're chest deep in filth
And you are going to have to wade through it to get to the other side.
I fell in love with him.
We were going to have...
I was excited to have a child with him.
He was the one person I chose in my life who made me happy. Who made me feel safe.
What does that say about me?
Everything we had was just a figment of my imagination.
Worse than a figment. A lie.
It was right in front of my face and I didn't see it.
I just
Believed it.
Time is the only thing that will allow you to find yourself again.
If you tell me to be patient one more time, I swear to god... I'm going to find him. I'm gonna find answers.
I need a lead.
Lizzy, if you want to find where the pavlovich brothers are, You need to find out where they've been.
The helicopter is key.
The pavlovich brothers burned that chopper to cover up evidence.
Fingerprints.
Those things might have identified the brothers, but what about the chopper?
The tail numbers were falsified and the chopper was re-painted. That's what they did, but where did they do it?
Is there a deeper forensic analysis we can run?
What particulates were in the heat exchange?
Was there moisture in the compressor?
I'll reach out to forensics.
Analyze every drop of fuel, track every grain of sand.
I want to know where that chopper's been.
Sorry, man, not for hire.
Hello, symir.
I'll be brief and to the point.
Yesterday you had a customer, Picked him up outside the national archives.
Oh, symir.
You should have taken the money.
Your passenger.
Where'd you drop him?
Ah, calculus.
I can't even think about derivatives Without thinking of that tutor in manor hall.
Cindy something-or-other.
Never wore a brassiere.
Always a bounce in her step.
Look, I'm talking. Cooperating.
You don't need to copy my driver's license, my credit cards.
We want to make sure we know where to reach you, geoffrey p.
Seevers. Should we have more questions.
So, tell me about the book.
I told you, I pick up and drop off.
I don't know names.
What is it, some kind of code?
How many times have you done this?
These drops.
This was the fourth.
I need you to write down the location of each drop you've made.
The pick-up and the drop location.
Oh, my god.
Pagosa springs public library?
I had a water pump go out in pagosa springs.
Bitch of a mountain, wolf creek pass.
Thought I was going to end up living out there with the hill people Until this teddy bear of a man Fixed me up at the local garage.
Tracy woods.
You don't know tracy, do you?
Leather vest?
Mustache?
Tracy woods?
I wonder if he's still fixing water pumps.
Anyway, it will always be a fond memory.
The list.
So that's it?
What about the package?
You are going to deliver it. Or return it. Or whatever the people you work for want you to do with it.
And as far as you're concerned, We never had this conversation.
Dembe. A copy, please.
I hope you have nothing pressing, this may take a minute or three.
You're sure you don't know him?
Leather vest. Mustache.
Tracy woods.
Shame.
I got something.
Okay, I never wanted to know this much About gas chromotography or gear lubricants, But I think mr.
Reddington is onto something.
We pulled the lab reports from the ntsb And the chopper's engine tested positive for two distinct compounds.
The first is ethephon. Which is a ripening agent for tobacco.
And how does that help us?
Tobacco production's way down in this area.
In fact, since 1998, the federal government Is actually paying farmers not to grow it.
Okay, but there are still plenty of tobacco farms.
I agree. Which brings us to chemical compound number two.
This one is used to grow sweet corn.
So we cross reference the two? Exactly.
We're looking for a pesticide manufacturer
Who used to supply tobacco growers, But made the transition to corn.
And how many of those are there?
Seventeen.
Of those, 11 are outside of the fuel range of this chopper.
Of the other six, Only one has a structure large enough to get that stolen helicopter Out of view and under construction.
Halifax agro-chem.
If I had to bet, I'd say that's their staging site.
It's around the corner, half a block up.
I make seven exterior cameras. Those are the ones they want us to see.
And it's on the list of drop sites I gave you?
How long has mr.
Keen been inside?
I tailed him here four hours ago.
Thank you, preston.
You want me to call sabusawa?
That would be ideal. But he's working an extraction in ecuador.
Then how do you plan on getting keen out of that concrete box?
We have a lead on xiaoping li.
Excellent. Tell me.
We think she's being held at halifax agro-chem in falls church.
We're assembling a team.
Lizzy.
I don't want to talk about tom with you.
You have your opinion on how to proceed and I have mine.
Just don't bother yourself, I'll deal with tom.
Lizzy, I assure you that will yield no answers and little satisfaction.
Well, I'll find out won't I?
I wish I could talk you out of this.
Well, good luck with xiaoping.
I'm raymond reddington.
Get out of here.
Go!
Move, move, move!
We're moving to the cars.
Or an atomic number. Something from a periodic table.
Why do you think that?
Because the only word I know that contains
The letters "vg" together is avgolemono. I don't know what that is. It's a soup.
Chicken stock, egg yolks and lemon juice.
Point is maybe xiaoping li left us a message.
I'll run the letter combination against the dmv registry.
See if we get a hit. Any luck?
I can't get ahold of reddington.
You told him the location where the brothers were holding xiaoping li, right?
Don't you find it a hell of a coincidence
That we show up there, they're gone, And now we can't get ahold of reddington? We've been played.
Red put us onto the pavlovich brothers
Because he knew it would lead him to xiaoping li.
That woman is worth millions.
Where are you going? I'm going to find reddington.
Get some answers.
Reddington, I need you to call me, please. I need some help with the case.
A gift from reddington. Enjoy.
Wasted. Two years we've spent.
On what?
Do you care at all about what you've done to me?
What you've done to my life?
What has it done to you? Who could do such a thing?
Finding you, stopping you...
You'd think I'd be happy you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison.
You think I'd get some satisfaction out of that.
But I don't. Because nothing,
No sentence, no punishment, no revenge Could ever come close to making up for what you've done. I was doing my job.
Your job?
That was our life!
We were going to have a baby.
You begged me to have a baby!
I was doing my job.
Stop talking about your job.
You, this...
Everything was a lie.
My life was a lie. Every feeling.
Every memory.
Say something to your wife who is dying in front of you.
It was the shoes.
That's when I knew.
It was those brown leather shoes.
It was our third or maybe fourth date.
You'd come over to my place on halstead and we ordered, a... Take out. And rented a movie that we never finished because we ended up...
And you had to get up early for work
And by the time I got up you were gone.
It was the sweetest thing.
And ever since that moment I just felt... Sorry for you.
Because I knew.
I knew that I had you.
Part of me didn't want it to work.
But it did.
Archimedes.
I beg your pardon? Archimedes' formula.
You know, the naked guy who shouted "eureka!"
Why would she write down a mathematical formula?
Maybe it's some kind of code. A language they don't understand.
Archimedes' principle indicates that the upward buoyant force Which is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid...
Aram.
Um...
Water displacement.
Boats displace water.
She's trying to tell us how they're getting her out of the country.
Contact the coast guard.
Get photos of the brothers and xiaoping li To every port authority on the eastern seaboard.
What's going on?
Where are we on xiaoping li?
They're trying to ship her out of the country.
We're combing through the manifests now. Where are you?
Waiting on reddington.
He still hasn't shown.
I'm telling you, keen.
He used us.
These guys, the pavlovich brothers?
You remember what they did.
You were there that day on the bridge.
When we take them down, I want you to be there.
I will be. Just as soon as...
I gonna have to call you back.
Xiaoping li. You took her.
You used the fbi and the pavlovich brothers to get to tom and, what?
Get xiaoping, make some bigger deal? Trade on her secrets?
I have no use for germ warfare.
And as for using the fbi,
I wouldn't be in this relationship if there wasn't a mutual benefit.
Where is she?
I tried to bargain for her life, but negotiations went sideways.
It was all I could do to get tom.
If we don't find her, if she gets sent back to the chinese,
She's going to die.
Tell me what you know.
We think they're putting her on a cargo ship. We're not sure.
We're looking over the manifests, time tables and shipping routes.
She isn't cargo, lizzy, she's contraband.
This is a smuggling operation.
And nothing is smuggled in or out of the chesapeake
Without rolph cisco knowing about it.
Have donald pay him a visit.
What is his obsession with you?
You guys got like a daddy-daughter thing going on?
Is daddy coming over?
So you gonna make me talk?
Rolph cisco.
Tell us about the pavlovich brothers.
Who do you work for? Liz, come on.
You don't have it in you.
Get me out of here.
Get me out!
It's okay, it's okay.
Easy, easy.
Come here.
I'm going to put you down.
Easy, easy.
You broke my thumb. Yeah, I did.
If you're looking for sympathy, you might want to start with honesty.
Here's an example of honesty, tom.
You've been making me pancakes for two years. I hate pancakes.
You want honest?
Here's one.
If you're going to handcuff somebody,
Don't break their thumb.
Your handcuffs.
One on the wrist.
One on the banister.
I am not here to hurt you, liz.
My job was never to hurt you.
I'm one of the good guys.
Reddington, he's not who you think.
I will find you.
I can prove it.
The key in the lamp.
I know you found it.
Take it to radford bank.
Box number 3929.
He is not who you think he is.
Goodbye, liz.
You want me to stop him?
We'll just let the tail follow him.
Tell me about whitefog.
Whitefog was a black project started by the chinese about five years ago.
You wanna tell me what's going on with agent keen? Sir?
Where was she today?
And don't tell me you don't know.
Was it reddington?
Are there problems?
I think she's having trouble at home, sir.
This whole time you've never let him out of your sight.
Your people are following him now.
How is this all going to end?
This is an end.
And then something new will begin.
You deserve the best in life, lizzy.
I know that sounds odd coming from a man Who's brought you some of the worst,
But it's the reason why tom Had to work so hard to be that for you.
To be kind. To be thoughtful. To make you laugh.
Because you deserve that.
And it will come.

Count Chloride takes Edna and her father for a drive in the park.
The suburb is deserted and the late hour favours some dark deeds.
The young girl finds safety in the main street, in the Excelsior Cinema, which still draws in passers-by.
That evening, after endless screenings, the film "Cabiria" had filled the cinema.
The heroic deeds that the brave Maciste performed for Cabiria, have affected the pursued girl.
The following day The following day
The post arrives at ltala Film studios.
Maciste's aperitif
October 1915 Dear Sir, a helpless young girl, pursued by powerful evildoers, dreams that Cabiria's saviour will also defend her.
She will be waiting on the old bridge, next Saturday at 4 pm hoping that, if bravery and goodness are not just screen fiction, she will meet Maciste.
Maciste is tempted by this adventurous task.
Caution suggests Maciste disguise himself as a good-hearted chap.
On the "Old bridge".
She tells her story:
"My father died suddenly, and the house was filled with sorrow.
Then Duke Alexis, my uncle, came."
"My mother was broken-hearted and he became the master of the house."
"One night I heard an anguished cry echoing."
I tried everything, but it was in vain!
It was as if she were mad and would not listen to my accusations."
"I also fell into a strange kind of lethargy, but it did not dim my conscience."
"When I recovered my senses, after many hours, we were already far away."
"A poor fisherman took pity on me and hid me."
"But the villains would not give up.
They still waited and, the other evening, I managed to escape them."
- But why don't you go to the police?
- What would happen to me if I were taken back to my uncle?
The villains sought help from some suspicious characters in the town, who joined together, assisted by an intelligent dog.
This wild story seems unbelievable and arouses Maciste's suspicion.
- I don't know how to help.
- I don't have much money on me, but...
- No. Thank you.
"Help me, Maciste!"
"Help me, Maciste!"
The road winds on. The villains realise they are being followed and they thwart their pursuer, by paying off the driver.
Maciste is persuasive, but gets no information.
"The dog reappears."
"If you found the girl, then you can find your master!"
Maciste begins to search patiently once more.
Shortly after, an old man enters the tavern.
Half an hour has already gone by.
Maciste might lose his shirt, but he's not about to die!
The innkeeper suddenly begins to like Maciste a great deal.
"Please, let me go!
I'll get you out of here."
"He's broken his neck down there and drowned."
The revolvers are empty and it's a good idea to load them.
But Maciste is good hearted, and takes pity on the poor things.
END OF PART TWO
PART THREE
Meanwhile, Duke Alexis, together with the psychiatric doctor, Krauss, hide the other victim.
But the villain who has escaped Maciste comes back to bother him.
"On no account must that man cross the border!"
A sad awakening.
Meanwhile Maciste, led by the young woman, is off to do his heroic deed.
The station at the border.
The railway line is out of action.
In order to continue the journey they need to travel to another station far away.
The chauffeur is the only victim of the attack.
But someone we know is traveling on the same train.
When he sees the man he thought was dead, the villain thinks that he is done for and plays his trump card.
"Your mother is held prisoner in the farmhouse in Valdeserta."
A new piece of luggage.
Come to me at once and bring your tools to the farmhouse in Valdeserta.
The farmhouse in Valdeserta is alone on a steppe.
"This is the farmhouse.
I'll wait for you here."
The scoundrel at work.
END OF PART THREE
PART FOUR
The prisoner isn't there.
Maciste sees a trick has been played on him.
The young girl is exhausted; only the farmhouse can offer them shelter.
Maciste made do with "a few eggs" that evening!
It was no coincidence that the villain led Maciste
It was no coincidence that the villain led Maciste to the farmhouse in Valdeserta. He knew the owner.
"I'll come back with a vehicle to carry the prisoners and the wounded."
Thus the second attack on Maciste was as unsuccessful as the first.
Duke Alexis trembles with rage at this new setback.
Meanwhile, Maciste and the young girl have arrived in town.

PART FIVE
Maciste observes his enemy's fortress.
The two pretend they know nothing, but Maciste finds something to refresh their memory.
In fact, thanks to the snow that fell recently, in just a couple of hours they remember everything.
The lady is being held by a certain Dr. Krauss, but I don't know where.
I do know that there'll be a party at the palace on Saturday.
Maciste has a plan.
"On Saturday at 11 pm, we must send this urgent telegram to Duke Alexis."
Another servant will come in useful for the party.
Maciste is in a great fervour of expectation.
At 11 pm.
Some unknown giant has been hanging about my building for several days.
I think he is interested in our patient.
Please send instructions.

EVEN AFTER MY DEATH
The City of Silence, where pride and ambition shudder.
Shadows and memories sleep under the peaceful cypresses.
In each gravestone, a story, a name, a date...
If only the most private tragedies of those standing by the graves could be read, too!
Here lies Elvira Meró May She Rest in Peace.
That morning, a man and a child were standing by a humble grave. What a sad memories they seemed to be evoking!
The man was mature. His features and manners revealed his distinguished origins, also the passing of time and the effects of thoughts.
The child was a spring-like portrait of the man.
A string of reminiscence stroke the man's spirit.
In just a few minutes
his tortured mind went through twelve years of memories.
Rosario, 25 september 19...
Dear Carlos,
Please hire miss Elvira Meró,
I've already spoke about her.
She's well educated, and reliable. She's may serve you to works of trust.
She's an orphan and has no friends or relatives.
- You'll be cashing up daily, also putting the money in the safe and handing accounting forms to me.
- This is the key.
- The manager, please.
- Our new cashier needs a place to live - Please, recommend her for some good decent guesthouse.
Luis Rodriguez and Sofanor Garramuño, two medicine students whose night studies obliged them to sleep during the morning.
Garramuño wouldn't want to graduate as some quack doctor, He was almost turning into an old man before graduating.
Mrs. Abundia de Palomeque, the widow of three captains dead during the war against Paraguay. She earned her own living by providing lodging for guests.
They were lacking of wine.
- Add some water to it.
- Didn't anybody give you hygiene lessons?
Dear Mrs. Abundia de Palomeque,
It is with great honor that I hereby recommend
Miss Elvira Meró, our cashier. She wishes to stay at your house, where she will feel as home.
A. Justo.
- You can rest assured. L'll be like a mother, or even like a father!
- This piece of junk won't awake anyone else!
- This projectile was thrown at me from your house.
- Who stays at the higher floors?
- Two students.
But don't get mad, Mr. Justo...
I'll deal with them. Not only they don't pay the rent, They also damage my reputation!
- That projectile was not thrown at the soup tureen, but at my head!
- L'll punish these punks terribly!
The students took position with their own artillery
- If this gentleman insists in molesting this lady, - I'll kick him so hard - that his own family won't be able to recognize him.
Lunch time.
L gladly introduce Mr. Ambrosio Hair to you.
He invented an anti-baldness device.
Its effects are quite remarkable.
Please, see for yourself.
Mrs. Abundia begins taking her terrible vengeance.
What are you laughing about, Mr. Bad Manners?
Starving to death,
Luis and Garramuño must go and find our daily bread.
Appetite has a good nose.
- Do you like candies and pastry, boys?
- We sure do!
- L'll give you lots of them if you call me dad.
- Yes, dad!
Elvira's kindness inspires her to be generous to her two nice and unfortunate fellow guests.
- Chocolate cream and pastry for my little children.
- Get your finger out of your nose!
- You can't hit me! You're not my real dad!
A little help from someone who cares about you.
At the restaurant the check turns to be Garramuño's worst dessert.
- L forgot my wallet at home!
- Please, let my children wait here while I go and look for it.
- Give them whatever they order.
Merriment comes with a full stomach. Garramuño goes to his class.
At 7:00 p. M., Garramuño's children are still at the restaurant, causing great surprise and losses.
- Have your dad forgot about you?
- That wasn't our dad.
- He offered us candies and pastries if we call him dad!
- Another tall story!
At night, back at the guesthouse.
Luis was able to quench his thirst and hunger at a friend's table. Then he met Elvira after work.
- Our family sent us money.
Elvira decides to go further.
Days later... The self-sacrificing instinct, most important virtue in a woman, keeps both students under Elvira's determined protection.
- Do you remember this?
- Haven't your families sent you money again?
- It's late.
We'll walk you home.
The good Elvira walks with them to the University. She makes sure that they actually attend their classes.
Her abnegation makes her be late for work. The indignant manager scolds her terribly
Thanks to his willingness, Luis becomes friend of rich and wise professor Doctor Ximénez.
Months later, this friendship between master and disciple makes Luis a frequent companion at the doctor's elegant table.
Meanwhile, at the humble guesthouse, Elvira gets Luis' clothes ready.
Luis,
I waited for you until 11:00 p. M., when Garramuño sent me to bed.
What a long dinner!
Were you thinking of me while eating?
L left two shirts and six pairs of socks ready for you.
The evening goes on in the luxurious living room. The aristocratic girl, not the orphan
- Congratulate me. L found a bride with a million pesos dowry.
- Elvira was waiting for you. - Seeing that you didn't arrive, she left this note.
The alcohol and the devil are the enemies of good actions.
The alcohol and the typical foolishness of a 20-years-old make Luis conceive a strange criminal idea.
The sleep always stands by the good people, and fell upon this kind soul like a gentle caress.
- What's all this?
- You're not worthy of her kind actions, - or my friendship.
- You're so ungrateful!
Tell her you're sorry!
- Young people get confused.
- One has to be careful, my child.
- Rude boys always get through the first open door they find.
- What an abusing young man!
- L never thought he might do something like this!
Doctor Ximénez pays attention to his daughter's subjective pleading.
- Please invite Luis to my birthday.
He's a really fun guy!
- If that's your wish, I'll be very glad to invite him.
Garramuño and Luis are interns at the Maternity Hospital.
- Garramuño, lend me 500 pesos!
L need them, I must buy a gift
The hospital has a holly mission, and Garramuño works tirelessly.
Dear Elvira,
A kind cashier like you won't say no!
The bearer of this letter will receive the money.
- L assure you! She took money from the safe! See it for yourself.
- With whose permission
did you get money from the safe?
- You cheated my sister so lowly!
- Forgive me, sir!
Her face burned in shame, her soul was tortured by sorrow. The unhappy woman returned to the guesthouse.
- L have a terrible headache.
She unburdened herself from her sorrow and shame with good old Garramuño.
- We must return that money.
An accusation would be terrible!
- We must help her. She's a good lady. We all make mistakes.
- L bring you the money.
Please, sign this bill for me.
- This will teach you to be a man, not a villain!
The emotions of such a stressful day make delicate Elvira fall ill.
Unaware of all the damage he caused,
Luis returns to the guesthouse.
- L'm so ashamed!
- Don't be. L'll graduate soon, and then we'll get married.
- The man who abuses of a naïve, self-sacrificed woman is not a man! It's a cynic!
This violent rupture with his friend obliges Garramuño to change rooms
There he goes with his things.
In his blind ambition, Luis only cares about that gift he bought at someone else's expenses.
- L feel ill.
Please, fetch Luis.
The triumph of evil.
- This dose is excessive.
Who prescribed this?
- A medicine student.
The tragedy seemed to threaten the house that night, and the night unleashed its own mysteries.
Cured.
Cleaning his friend's messy room,
Elvira discovers a terrible secret.
The sinister idea of death, perhaps a comforting idea in such unfortunate days, came to the mind of this impulsive poor soul.
Luis, fate does us apart.
L wish you can be happy with the woman you love, the woman you abandoned me for. Good bye forever.
Elvira.
At the same time, that other woman prepares herself for a happy night. She doesn't know that she's a rival.
Anticipating his triumph, the drunk, frivolous student dresses up for such a joyful party.
Dear Garramuño, Luis doesn't love me anymore.
L now know that he even made a thief of me to give another woman a gift.
My only wish was to live for him and with him. Given his love for another woman, my only destiny should be death.
My good and loyal friend, this is my final farewell.
Garramuño goes to the police.
L recommend the retention of miss Elvira Meró, argentinean, 21 years old, regular height, thin, white, blond, blue eyes.
Meanwhile...
I recommend the retention of miss Elvira Meró, Argentinean, 21 years old, regular height, thin, white, blond, blue eyes.
The Commissar.
- Look for her at the Palermo woods.
- No news?
Miss Elvira Meró was arrested by agent Ivaldi at 23:30 hours, when she tried to throw herself to the train.
Few months later.
Recommended by Garramuño,
Elvira becomes the governess of a distinguished house.
But soon...
My dear friend, why did you ruin my comforting resolution of that day?
The outcome I feared the most is now becoming true.
L'm having a child and I'm getting fired!
Help me, for God's sake!
The engagement.
Times have changed...
The girls were ashamed of boys before, but not now.
Only in public charity that poor good soul finds help.
Reserve an anatomic bed for me, I have an examination tomorrow.
- She's in God's hands.
One more, life and death meet face to face.
- Do you know who is she?
No, not you!
- Look what you did!
She donated her body to him, and by being good even after her death, she won his heart definitely.
He sets course to the unknown.
The loyal Garramuño satisfies poor Elvira's last wish.
'Look after the child', commanded him both the dead woman and his own kindness.
And there he was, a complete father, as gentle to the child as a mother could be.
- Don't cry, little boy.
The evocation is over now.
That man was Dr. Luis Rodriguez, who had come back from exile. And his child, now grown up and educated by Dr. Garramuño.
They visited the grave of their beloved woman and pulled the petals off the eternal flowers of memory.

Home of the world's greatest scientific detective,
Coke Ennyday.
EATS
- DRINKS DOPE
- SLEEP
The police chief often came to Coke Ennyday for help.
Coke Ennyday took no chances on admitting a visitor without consulting his scientific periscope.
Chief I. M. Keene Short Beach
We are greatly mystified by the presence of a gentleman down here rolling in wealth, without any viable means of support.
Endorsed find photo.
The gentleman rolling in wealth.
"Press me out a bundle of money."
DISGUISES
At Short Beach, the mysterious gentleman is joined by a female confederate.
The Leaping Fish.
Quietly Coke Ennyday stole out on the rail.
At the bath house where the man of mystery made. his weekly clean up.
"Give me that girl in marriage or I'll spill the beans!"
Inane, the little fish-blower of Short Beach.
Without a moment to lose
Coke Ennyday arrived at the scene of action.
Stuck in the mud.
LIFE SAVER
Exhausted by the mental strain.
"You have saved my life!"
"I am Coke Ennyday, the detective.
See!"
"Is this you?"
"Yep, that's me!"
Even the fish worked against him.
"Tell the fish-blower she has got to marry Fishy Joe within the week."
"You must consent to marry Fishy Joe within the week."
"Have no fear.
Coke Ennyday the scientific detective will protect you."
"Japs on the leaping fish! Get the cans!

"Woman, we've got to make a quick get-away! "
Full of hop.

"Girl, you are in my power."
POLICE PATROL
"At last we meet face to face."
"That means fight in my country."
"The best man walks out!"
The duel in the dark.
The police lost their way.
"Nobody home."
But not the end of this story...
"No, Douglas, you had better give up scenario writing and stick to acting."
In 2004 a tinted nitrate print of Terje Vigen was rediscovered.
From this print a black and white duplicate negative was made in 2005.
The film's original intertitles were inserted into the new negative, and the colours were recreated by the Desmet tinting method.
Act One.
There lived a remarkably grizzled man on the uttermost, barren isle;
He never harmed, in the wide world's span, a soul by deceit or guile;
His eyes, though, sometimes would blaze and fret most when the storm was nigh, -
And now, all I've heard about Terje I'll try to tell from the first to last.
With land underfoot he was never at ease; no, better by far then to dwell on the seas, on the mighty ebb and the flow.
In autumn, when wild-geese were singing south, he met with their flying skein.
A heaviness fell on the sailor's breast;
Life lay astern with fire and zest, and ahead lay a winter's gloom.
They anchored, and off his crewmen went with leave for a wild carouse.
He watched them with envy and discontent while he stood by his silent house.
Indoors there were two bestowed;
His wife sat and span in the peaceful light, but the crib held a rosy, healthy mite, a baby girl, and it crowed.
That instant, and Terje's mind, men say, turned sober upon the spot.
He would sing all his happiest ditties there, where little Anna tugged his brown hair and lay in his folding arm.
Life ambled along till the year of war in eighteen-hundred and nine.
The tale's still told of what people bore, where want and distress combine.
Cruisers from England blockaded each port, by land there was dearth far and wide;
The poor people starved, the wealthy went short,
two powerful arms were no longer support with death and disease outside,
Then Terje drooped for a day or two
But his miseries quickly go;
he thought of a comrade, ancient and true: the sea's great ebb and its flow.
The smallest dory there was to hand he chose for his Skagen trip.
Sail and mast he left home on land, such gear he thought best not ship.
"When winds stopped blustering quite so wild, -
- Terje Vigen rowed for his wife and child crossed the sea in an open boat!"
The Jutland reef was the devil to clear, but worse, he'd the English blockade to fear its look-out's eagle-eyed gleam.
To be continued.
Act Two.
At Fladstrand, reaching there safe and sound, he gathered his precious stores.
Here was the staff of life to hand; and his wife and baby call.
The fourth morning, at dawn, by sun's first rays, a blurred, misty line to scan.
Near home at last; -
That instant the word froze on his lip;
Gæsling's the shoal with hidden top just east of the Homborg sound;
The English officer shouted "stop!" He hoisted an oarbutt, let it drop, and stove in the dory's shell.
"There on the innermost beach ashore watches my wife at our pitiful door and waits with our baby for bread!"
He dived and he swam and he dived yet again;
In two feet depth all that treasure sank.
They lifted him out and over the side
He offered his sorrow, they sold him their glee
Then Terje fell silent, all hope was past, he locked up his grief in his soul.
He languished in prison for many a day, for all of five years, say some
His shoulders rounded, his hair it turned grey from dreaming about his home.
Then eighteen-fourteen came and with it accord;
A Swedish frigate brought home onboard - - Norway's prisoners, and Terje too.
Back at the jetty he came ashore a pilot by King's decree;
But few recalled in the greybeard they saw, the youngster who braved the sea.
His house was a stranger's; and how they fared those two, inside he soon found:
"The husband forsook them, and nobody cared, they came to the plot that the paupers shared, in the parish burial-ground."
To be continued.
Act Three.
Years went by, and he kept to his trade as pilot out there on the isle
His eyes, though, sometimes would blaze and fret, when the reef to the breakers ran high,
And then people sensed he was troubled yet, and then there were few who felt no threat with Terje Vigen by.
One moonlit night, with onshore wind, there was a stir where the pilots sit
An English yacht being carried in with mainsail torn and jib split.
Close-reached to the weather, a cutter sped
Like a hero he seized on the wheel;
"Preserve us alive from the breakers' roar, l'll make you as wealthy as wretched before."
The pilot let go of the craft.
His cheeks they went white, and his mouth shaped a sound, like a smile that at last can break free.
The yacht was broached and ran squarely aground, his lordship's queen of the sea.
"Abandon the ship!
To the boats, I say!"
"My lord and my lady, stay near!"
To Ieeward he glanced at Gæslingen's top, and to windward at Hesnes' swell.
He let go helm and the foresail strop, he hoisted an oarbutt and let it drop, and stove in the cutter's shell!
"Anna, my child!" she cried out in dread
To be continued.
Act Four.
They grounded and sank, but calmness itself inshore of the arc of rough seas
"... There'snocausefor grief!" "A sunken dory supplies our relief, three barleygrain casks our dock."
He knew, now, the sailor that on his knee had crouched on his deck and wept!
"You sailed at ease in your mighty corvette, -
- I rowed in my humble boat."
"I toiled for my own in my forehead's sweat, you robbed them of bread, and could mock me yet and over my salt tears gloat."
"It's time for my vengeance to strike, beware!"
"Stand back there, my lord!
One step if you dare, and your wife and child is the price!"
But Terje's forehead showed peaceful and fair.
"And now Terje Vigen's himself again."
"Like a rocky stream flowed my blood till then; for I had to - I had to repay!"
"The years I spent in the prison's roar, they bred my heart's sickliness."
"But now it's over;
we two are even."
When daylight had broken, then all was well; long lay the yacht in port.
One day milord and lady came by.
"No, rescue came in the nick out there from this little mite by me."
In 1956, Fernando Birri and the Santa Fe Documentary School rescued "The Last Indian Raid" from oblivion. A 35 mm copy, provided by Alcides Greca's family, was screened then.
In 1968, Rosario's Film Society rendered it into a 16 mm copy. The technician Fernando Vigévano was in charge of the project.
Since the 35 mm copy is considered lost, the new restored cut had to be made from the 16 mm version preserved by the Museo del Cine.
Those colour tones were lost during the 16 mm rendering, in which only B/W film was used. In order to restore that,
Cousuelo's notes were checked, and also the testimonies of Film Society member Octavio Fabiano, who was able to observe the original film.
Intertitles extension was also improved. In the 16 mm version, intertitles extension had been distorted because Vigévano had to copy almost all intertitles from stills, choosing the most clearer ones.
THE LAST INDAIN RAID By Dr ALCIDES GRECA
PROLOGUE CIVILIZATION AND THE INDIAN
A beautiful town called San Javier in Argentina, became better known after this event.
The newspapers widely reported the sad events that took place there.
Nueva Época:
San Javier Indian Raid
Mocovi tribe in terrible conditions 48 casualties, 90 wounded.
La Capital:

Seriousness of the events
Dr Alcides Greca, born in San Javier, author of this historical reconstruction, was a representative of his town in Government Congress.
It won't be the sick poetry imported from Paris, nor the pulp fiction, nor the romance.
Mr. Fernando Centeno, Governor of Chaco,
Former Deputy Dr Ferrarotti and Dr Greca, debate about the script of this film.
Mr Centeno thinks that
The Last Indian Raid was still to come.
San Javier.
Near this town, where the pioneers of civilization built their houses and wealth, the Mocovi people live in terrible conditions.
A centenarian Mocovi woman.
China Petrona and her progeny.
The tribe's old chief, Mariano Lopez
The rebel chief, Salvador Lopez, leader of the 1904 insurrection.
"Don" Desiderio Balcaza, the tribe's "coplero" (poet). He, like Don Quixote, rides a skinny horse.
Juan Saldón, a crazy toba aborigine who does a forward roll, howls like the fox and cries like the "chajá" (Southern Screamer).
They use modern weapons for hunting macaws, maguari storks and wild ducks that inhabit the nearby lagoons.
They use "bolas" for hunting ostrich, a highly profitable activity given its tasty meat.
They hunt caiman, a dangerous animal that lives in water habitats such as lagoons and streams.
They use a thick fishing line, a spear and meat. The caiman eat the meat through the night.
The Mocovi are farmhands in the local ranches of San Javier.
Moving away.
Roping
Cutting
Taming
"Latagá" (cane) Is the Mocovi's worse enemy. They get drunk at the local "pulperías" (tavern).
The white people pushed them to drink.
Now they punish them and even take them to jail for drinking.
Rosa Paiquí, a beautiful half-breed girl, was his loving companion.
Jesus Salvador, the old chief's brother, missed the old days, when he would roam in the woods.
He regretted the day when he and his people were leaded to San Javier by a Franciscan missionary brother.
Who he was secretly in love with.
The tribe's poor living conditions, the hatred he felt toward his brother and his love for Rosa leaded him to dream of becoming the Mocovi's chief.
Salvador visits Bernardo in order to convince him of taking care of the people.
- Bernardo, sleeping all day long;
our people are hungry. Go talk to the Police chief and get our land back.
- I won't make chief Benito angry!
Jesus' generosity left a print in Rosa's heart.
Me, I love you so much! Take this necklace, made of caiman and "yarara" teeth.
Wear this and you will defeat the white and become chief!
I bless you Jesus, our savior!
Act II The Conspiracy
Salvador summons his younger brothers and the tribe's "curacas".
- The reason why I have summoned you is that I am tired of working for the gringos, tired of suffering.
Bernardo is not helping the Indian.
The Gringos have taken our land.
Our people are starving.
Let's kick them out!
Gringos have lots of arms,
Mausers and Winchesters...
Indians only have hunting rifles and spears. We can't fight them!
- Gringos will bring troops from Santa Fe in order to defeat us. Chief Benito is mean. He puts us to jailç if we drink "latagá",
He has forbidden the ball.
The police chief has been taking away our daughters and sisters.
Together we can defeat the Gringos!
Saint Francisco Javier will protect the Mocovi.
The bullets will turn into mud.
The Indian will fight using Indian weapons.
The Gringos will turn into pigs, and the town will be ours.
Their women and houses will belong to us!
Juan and Andrés are cowards, just like chief Bernardo.
They fear the Gringo.
Salvador is not scared.
If Salvador becomes the chief and kicks the Gringos out, I will be his woman.
You will be chief Salvador's wife, and the Gringo's daughters will be your servants.
The chasquis (messengers) Were quickly sent to Santa Rosa and San Martín in order to spread the news about the upcoming revolt.
Several aboriginal families immigrated to San Javier in a two year period. Strange ceremonies were held at night...
Those Mocovi, who were still loyal to chief Bernardo, took care of his affairs.
The tribe's spies kept a close look on the enemy's activities the white people from San Javier enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle without noticing that a tempest was about to start.
Meanwhile, in a hidden corner of the region,
Jesus Salvador was proclaimed chief by the tribe notables.
Love affaires, Balls and Religion.
The day of the uprising was approaching and that year the Mocovi pushed the boat out to celebrate San Javier's day.
The procession.
The Mocovi carry their Saint to the church.
The Mocovi celebrated through five days and nights. The executed their traditional dances: "Sarandí", "tontoyogo",
"bravo" and "cielito".
The fellows took a chance to dance with the ladies.
The dancing partners
Those that broke that rule were tied to a pole.
They were bailed out if they paid in money, cigars or alcohol.
The Mocovi sang amusing and kind of melancholic tunes, though they were not refined.
- Mr. San Javier! Mr. San Javier!
Pray for us, the poor ones...
Us, the poor ones!
Turn around again, Cenciona Valdé.
The turn you have made, you've made it in reverse.
Long live Santa Rosa!
Dance, dance Sinforosa.
Stomp your feet fellow.
Stomp your feet like the chestnut horse does...
Your love affairs are like a yoyo. Like a yoyo.
Sometimes they improvised for the local tycoons' amusement.
- Mr. Pancho Troco.
Mr. Pancho Troco.
Buy us some gin.
Have a drink.
Rosa, who had been forbidden to dance by the chief, remained seated among the old ladies, absorbed in sad thoughts.
She rejected many gentlemen that had invited her to dance.
But she couldn't resist one, who didn't care about Bernardo's orders.
Bernardo sees that his orders were not obeyed.
And forces Rosa to comeback home.
- You were dancing with Salvador, that thief!
Don't insult him!
I'll teach you!
The next day, two of Bernardo's men took Rosa to a faraway corner in the islands.
Rosa was kept in there for several weeks, in exile, thinking about Salvador.
Ananoque, one of Salvador's loyal helpers, had tracked her down.
Chief Salvador sends this ceibo (national flower of Argentina) And cochiyo for the day. I'll keep you up to date.
Act IV. The regression
The Indians had started to go back to a more primitive stage.
They had moved away a large amount of stolen cattle to the islands.
Several farmers were killed in their own land
Not even the bullets could hold the hungry of Mocovi back.
The land owners and farmers constantly complained to the Police Chief.
The Mocovi, who prefer mare meat over any other kind, would not miss a chance of satisfying their appetite.
Many Mocovi were arrested for committing such crimes.
This reprisal urged Jesús Salvador to quickly gather together all his followers.
Juan and Andrés, Salvador brothers, were planning to murder chief Bernardo.
Bernardo found shelter at the Police Station.
Meanwhile, the people in the town became aware of the imminent danger.
Women and children panicked.
April 21st, 10 am. Tension between people in town and he Indian was growing fast. The battle was about to start.
The sky over San Javier turned threateningly black, and a tempest broke in the islands.
Rosa hears the ostrich booming. It was the sign she was expecting. The rebellion had just started, and she decides to act.
I've hurt my hand.
Bring some water from the well.
There you go!
So you won't be cheating on Bernardo again! Evil woman!
Act V
Chief Benito reacts to the Mocovi attack.
At noon, the Mocovi interrupted the communications by cutting the telegraph wire.
The Governor of Santa Fe received the following message.
"Thousands of insurgent Indians... "
This telegram and some other alarming rumors reached the Capital city through different via. The newspapers reported out the terrible events.
News received from different places confirms Mocovi Indian uprising in San Javier.
Town inhabitants were slaughtered. Last telegram received at the Government says: "Thousands of insurgent Indians... "
Personnel are assumed dead when going...
They are attacking the town.
Meanwhile in Santa Fe, rumor had it that the storm hadn't have started yet in San Javier...
Gaucho Feliciano Luna went to see the Mocovi in order to claim the horses they had stolen from him.
Hey you, chief of thieves, give back the horses you have stolen from me.
- Indian did not steal any horse, old Luna.
How dare you!
Thief, give back my horses, otherwise I will...
They are going to kill Luna! Fire!
Five minutes later.
The town was besieged by the raging Mocovi for two hours.
The battle ended. The tribe had been defeated.
San Javier's brave youths went after the fugitives.
The wounded Mocoví hid in the rushes and tried to heal their wounds.
That night, in the ranches... The neighbors set the Mocovi campground on fire.
Act VI Chasing the indian
Several groups went out to watch out the surroundings, where the Indians had supposedly committed terrible crimes.
The defeated Mocovi ran away toward the islands, heading the Gran Chaco, avoiding the northern towns.
One group of rebels remained standing. Commanded by Salvador, they had changed their objective. They couldn't conquer the town, but they would capture Bernardo.
The old tribe chief was away from the anger of the Mocovi.
The police dismantled the group of rebels. Jesús Salvador and his loyal Ananoque managed to go in San Javier in order to reach the islands.
At the sunset, the two Mocovi, living symbols of defeat, approach shack where Rosa Paiquí was kept prisoner.
That poor half-breed girl was still tied to the post.
All of a sudden, an awful scene took place in front of her sad eyes.
Salvador!
Epilogue
Once there, in the land of high breakaxes and noble palm trees,
Jesus Salvador was the chief of Rosa Paiquí's heart.
The restless Indian, who fought against civilization, took from it its sweetest legacy:
The kiss, which was unknown to his people.

Act 1
The nights before Sunday were the worst.
Thormund, the wealthiest farmer in the village
- Hjalmar Peters
Ola, his son
- Kurt Welin
Courage, my boy!
I have talked to Knut Huseby, and you will receive a warm welcome.
Knut Huseby
- Theodor Blich
Aslaug. Knut Huseby's daughter - Gull Cronvall
You don't seem to succeed much better then the rest of us in pleasing the Huseby wolf
Sigurd and Oivind, Huseby's sons - Hugo Tranberg and Gosta Cederlund
Since I've been given a daughter, I'm obliged to protect her, boys
You are so right, father.
Whoever makes his way here will be saluted by me
Should we baptize him?
I think you dampened his burning desire.
Darling, come what may, tomorrow I will speak with your father.
Tomorrow I will follow you to Huseby and propose in Knut's presence.
On Sunday, after Tore had escorted his mother home from church ...he set out to address Huseby, just like he had promised Aslaug. - Hilda Castegren
No, no, my lad, don't even think of such haughtiness.
You, a poor smallholder's son, could never get the daughter at Huseby.
I most certainly can, little Mum.
It's plain to see that these two suit each other well.
Although the girl is a little shy, of course.
Is your father at home?
You, Knut Huseby, are a wealthy man, and I myself am no church mouse.
You have many children, and I only have this one son.
What if you gave my son your daughter's hand in marriage?
It seems a fair offer, but in this case my daughter will have to make her own decision.
Go out and find Aslaug, Sigurd.
It so happens that Aslaug and I have loved each other for a long time.
I have come here to ask for her hand.
If I can't have Tore, I will not spend another happy day in this world
As yet, there is no tradition here on Huseby for farmers' daughters ...to share the marriage bed with smallholders' sons.
Nevertheless, that day is likely to arrive.
The end of Act 1
A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 2
A few days later.
Aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture.
The next Saturday night.
Only one road led to the Huseby summer farm, and it passed right by the main farm.
Would you believe that boy!
He seems to be heading for the mountain farm!
God's peace on the summer farm!
God's peace to you too.
It's just not right that this smallholder stud should be allowed up at the Huseby summer farm.
Well, if no one else can keep him at bay ...I guess me and my sons should give it a try.
I may still possess some talent in that direction.
Come on, boy, let's have a bout!
Enough for today, fiddler!
Come back soon, and I'll give you some more!
Don't forget your fiddle when you come to our wedding.
A lazybone like you will have to accept whatever comes his way.
While Aslaug faithfully yearned, Tore approached the Huseby farm.
If next Saturday you manage to slip past the Huseby wolf and his cubs, the girl will be yours.
The end of Act 2
A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 3
A few days passed.
Since Tore visit to the farm, there had been no news from the valley.
What do you want, my lad?
How do you do up here, Aslaug?
You are probably a bit lonely now that Nesset cannot come here anymore?
Yes, he got what he deserve.
We fixed him up so well last Saturday night, ...that he's probably lost all desire to go courting again at the Huseby mountain farm.
Come next Saturday.
Tore was fit again, although not in such high spirits as he used to be.
In the worst case, I'll get a good beating!
We're just here to make sure that the smallholder boy from Nesset stays away from the summer farm tonight.
Yes, we would like to join you.
Position yourselves two at every hill.
If he approaches, whistle!
I bet Ola would love to go to the mountain farm himself tonight.
The two of us as well.
The girl will finally have to give up ...because the engagement will be broken off tonight.
The boys will stand guard down here.
The end of Act 3
A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 4
It was on a Saturday evening. I had been awaiting you.
You promised me to come, but your promise proved untrue.
Where could you find a rose where no rose ever grows?
Where can true love be found if your sweetheart lets you down?
God's peace on the mountain farm!
God's peace to you too!
That fellow is worth having.
The girl shall be his.
The shimmering summer air hangs over Hardangerfjord.
Against the sky in bluish hue the mighty mountains loom.
The glacier shines, the hillsides are green.
The clime is clad in its finest attire.
And behold!
Over green, clear waves a bridal procession sails.

Characters:
Tokuyawa, the daimyo O-Take-San, his daughter The Bonze Karan, the temple servant
Karan, the temple servant Kin-be-Araki, the teahouse keeper Hanake, O-take-San's servant girl Olaf J. Anderson Eva
Tokuyawa, the Daimyo travels from Europe back to Japan.
O-Take-San, his daughter
"Father, I am so happy that You have returned ---- during Your absence I had to suffer so much from the Bonze!"
"O-Take-San, your father has brought this for you from the foreign lands."
The Bonze.
Karan, the temple servant.
"Noble Lord, Your servant is guarding the Holy Shrine from the trampling of foreign feet!"
"May Buddha bless Your return!"
"You have taken many foreign things to Lippon again."
"I noticed from the gifts for Your daughter."
Olaf J. Anderson.
...So, in a couple of days O-Take-San will become priestess in the 'Holy Forest'...
"If my child wants to - I shall not force her!"
"You have lost your faith in Buddha in those foreign lands!
Fear his wrath!"
"That awful Bonze persecutes me, because I have perceived his unclean purposes...
but I will pray to Buddha myself...
and Buddha will hear O-Take-San!"
"Forgive Your poor servant, who is not worthy to be Buddha's priestess... but who wants to sacrifice to the Noble One her greatest and dearest treasures: her puppets."
"Buddha will make sure that You are punished."
Three weeks later the festival of the 'Falling Leaves' is celebrated.
'May Buddha bless you!
The Mikade, his name be praised.
Thanks You for Your message about the traitorous Daimyo, who, with foreign doctrines wants to incite the people against the sanctified person of the Mikado.
The rebellious one will not escape his punishment...'
"An envoy from the Mikado awaits You, master!"
"The noble Mikado sends You this gift...
You know what it means...
within 24 hours You must bid life farewell!"
"A gift from our merciful Lord, the Mikado.
A sign of his mercy!"
"Go into the garden, for our guests are missing You!"
"O-Take-San has something to tell You!"
"The Daimyo is dead!"
"As final sign of his devotion to the Mikado, he gave him his life."
"That is the palace of Daimyo Tokuyawa, he is a favorite of the Mikado and his house is one of the most hospitable in Japan."
"Your father was punished for your sins by Buddha.
Don't change your mind, Buddha is strict, so serve him as priestess."
"Behind this wall lies the 'Holy forest', where no European may enter!"
"Prepare yourself for it, O-Take-San, in a couple of days your initiation as priestess will take place."
"How did You get here, stranger?
Don't you know our strict laws?"
"If You don't want to fall into the hands of guards You should leave quickly!"
"Come tomorrow at the same hour..."
"O-Take-San would be a very good Geisha for the keeper of the Teahouse."
"....a normal garden...."
"I cannot follow You, for soon I will be consecrated as Buddha's priestess."
"...in the evening".
"Come quickly, O-Take-San, I want free you, but promise me you will be quit!"
"Olaf, you changed a lot.
Come with us to the Teahouse!"
"A new geisha!"
"If you pay well, I will bring you the most beautiful geisha in Nagasaki."
"Noble chief, You can only keep this geisha if, according to the laws of the Yoshiwara, you marry her for 999 days.
You have, however, the right to divorce her, whenever you want."
"I am willing."
The next morning.
"Karan!"
"Where is O-Take-San?"
"Bring me O-Take-San, or I.."
Some time later.
"I can't approve the marriage of Olaf Anderson with that Japanese girl, for it won't be long before we return home!"
"Holy Priest, after much effort I've found O-Take-San.
She is married to a foreign marine officer and lives in the Teahouse on the hill."
"Be cursed, an unfaithful one."
The weeks later.
"I went to collect my inheritance..."
"This illustrates the three virtues of Japanese girls!
They may hear nothing, speak nothing and see nothing."
"This is the sword with which my father killed himself, by order of the Mikado!"
"You shouldn't put so much faith in your happiness, O-Take-San...
it could change quickly!"
"Olaf will never leave me..!"
"My dear Olaf, it is not nice of you, to make your little wife sad."
"That little O-Take-San seems to really love you!"
...and when the Honeymoon was over...
"Greetings O-Take-San, don't be sad...
I am travelling back to Europe, but...
I will return!"
"Come back swiftly Olaf...
You do know... that you...
must come back!"
The memories of the land where the peaches grow.
...some little geisha somewhere...
"Little Olav, repeat after me:
Great Buddha, grant me my wish and make O-Take-San happy again!"
Lord Matahari.
"In four weeks it will be four years ago, that O-Take-San's husband left her.
According to our laws, she will be free again then, and must return to the Yoshiwara!"
"...and if she has no money to buy herself free!"...
"I want to know immediately where O-Take-San lives!"
Dear Olaf!
You probably still remember that little geisha, who you married years ago.
The poor creature has taken the affair very seriously, and has been waiting all these years with her child in tender longing for you...
"O-Take-San lives with the keeper of the Teahouse, Kin-Be-Araki!"
"The Bonze wants you to ask her for the rent for the room...
if O-Take-San cannot pay...
she must remain in your Teahouse!"
"That stranger paid for three years, O-Take-San has been living here with me for four years now and if does not pay the rent, she must leave this house immediately."
"I have nothing, but my husband, Olaf Jens Anderson, will be back soon, and then you will certainly get the money!"
"In my department I will not allow the oppression of the poor!"
"You won't be bothered by that Landlord again, take this money!"
"O-Take-San is beautiful...
and I don't want her to lack anything!"
"Today I got the order to set sail for Japan. Would you like to come along?"
...and when the peach trees were in bloom again...
"O-Take-San, an emissary from Lord Matahari awaits you!"
"I love you, O-Take-San, and if you want..."
"O-Take-San, would be my wife?"
"I do not want your wealth.
I am the wife of Olaf Anderson.
I'd rather die than be unfaithful to him!"
"You are mistaken, O-Take-San...
Olaf Anderson is not your husband and your mariage..."
"I won't have you insult my husband, he'll return soon to me and his child!"
"A European ship has entered the harbor...
I can feel that... it's Olaf!"
"Come, Hanake, let us decorate the house with flowers for the reception!"
After a night of waiting awake in vain...
"I'm going to the consulate to ask for him!"
"O-Take-San's time is up.
She must go back to the Yoshiwara.
The child will be entrusted to the State."
"Master, help!
They want to steal O-Take-San's child!"
"Olaf Anderson, help for godsake!
They are trying to steal your child!"
"...now that she is free again, she must return to the 'Holy Forest'!"
"Go away!
You weren't concerned about Buddha's sacred service.
You just wanted to have your revenge!"
"My gratitude for your protection, Lord.
But I cannot become your wife...
I am the wife of Olaf Anderson!"
"Come, it is at least your duty to help that poor O-Take-San!"
"He is coming, O-Take-San!
He is coming!"
"Why doesn't he come himself...
I know... he has forgotten me...
it was Your will!"
"He can come collect the child himself, tell him that!"
"Go inside and get your child!"
"It's better to die with honour than to live in shame!"
"Where is O-Take-San?"
"O-Take-San is dead!"

Die Spinnen (The Spiders) was Fritz Lang's third feature film... and the first to establish his reputation as one of Germany's... foremost silent directors.
Lang's work on The Spiders... prevented him from directing the expressionist classic...
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, a film that had been assigned to him... by producer Erich Pommer.
The credits of The Spiders, however, include several names... famous by Caligari, such as Set Designer Hermann Warm and... actress Lil Dagover.
Filmed in 1919, The Spiders was made... in two parts designed to be shown on two different theatre dates.
Lang's plans to complete the serial story with a third... and fourth part to be titles The Secret of the Sphinx and For Asia's Imperial Crown... were unfortunately never realized.
The film's obsession with diabolical evil directed by... a powerful but unseen force is a foreshadowing... of the Dr. Mabuse films made by Lang three years later...

And Kay Hoog saw...
"You will never leave here alive.
"Tell us how you took her prisoner..."
"During the nigt I saw smoke rising.
I investigated and saw..."
"On the day of the Great Festival the blood of the prisoners will stain... the sacrificial rock and you. Priestess of the Sun, will offer the sacrifice."
"I offer flowers which are pure and white, as sacrifice. But the blood... of a man? Kill?

The Ancestress Austrian silent film from 1919
The Viennese Kunstfilm-Industrie presents the charming Liane Hain in:
The Ancestress based on the play by Franz Grillparzer
Tragedy in six acts Cast
Count Zdenko of Borodin
Berta, his Daughter The Ancestress of the House of Borotin
Jaromir
Boleslav, a bandit
Act One
My cousin suddenly died last night.
Now I am the last survivor of our house, which will perish after me.
Act Two
The last days of my existence shall be devoted to your happiness.
Choose your husband freely from all sons of this country.
This summer night, as I went farther than ever before, I was ambushed in the forest.
By chance I found him again.
Soon, it will not be chance anymore.
Noble be his dynasty, noble his deed Bring him to me, I want to meet him.
Do you want to kill your father?
Was this a dream?
Tell me, what's the matter, girl, that you frighten a life weary sleeper as if you were a nocturnal ghost?
I just came from the balcony When you fell asleep I went out longingly to wait for my dearest!
Woe is me, the ancestress!
The ancestress of this house.
Named Berta just like you.
Beautiful and charming, just like you, forced by her parents into a hated marriage
In her lover's arms, she was killed by her husband, who stabbed her into the heart.
She has to wander restlessly until this house has perished.
Whenever doom is imminent, she appears.
And you can hear her lament.
Lamenting her powerlessness, as she can foresee but not prevent.
Act Three
I come from the woods, where I was ambushed by bandits.
I shall inform the count.
Whatever this house can offer, it shall be at your service.
It's him who saved me.
He is the noble man.
Tell me your rank and name.
My noble guest, go to sleep, may an angel guard you.
Did all hell break loose?
Listen, those words, she prays.
Prays for me!
There you are, beloved.
Don't send me away so coldly.
Berta, my Berta.
Here and there, there and here.
It's her everywhere and nowhere!
Feel me, feel me, it's me.
And at the light of dawn a face appeared with well known features, yes, your face.
Are you already considered family?
Escape my son, while there still is time.
Whatever may happen, I will be on your side.
If necessary I will perish with you.
Act Four
Suspicious folk was sighted near your castle.
Members of the gang of bandits, the scourge of this neighborhood.
My son in law, who was ambushed this night as well.
Many have been hanged already and I will get the rest too.
Do you want to tarnish the soul of this fair maiden with your hate?
You are strong, help us to fight them.
Take this sword.
I'm not much good as a bloodhound.
The incident last night has shattered his constitution.
He barely is himself anymore.
Stop, captain.
I know my duty as well you know yours.
I will fight on your side!
My sword will prove that Count Borotin is no accomplice to the bandits.
What was that?
And how did you get wounded?
To proceed seemed dangerous, so I returned.
As I knew your father was outside,
I wanted to help, ran down and was shot.
We almost caught the leader of the bandits.
I shot him in the arm, we fought, and he escaped, but he left this piece of cloth.
Act Five
Yes, I am the one they are searching for.
I am the cursed bandid Jaromir.
My Berta, don't be sterner than God.
Don't reject me, you lovely.
If you don't escape with me, I shall stay.
Here they shall bind me, chain me, then you will see my bones rot.
Escape with me.
At 12 o'clock I will wait at the crypt.
But one more thing, child - get me weapons.
Your vow gave my life new meaning.
It wouldn't take weapons to take me to freedom.
This bottle would be enough.
If it puts your mind at rest, take it.
Isn't this a dagger?
Don't take it, it's cursed.
Farewell my child, the future is bright and don't forget midnight.
This underground corridor leads to the dungeons of my castle.
They brought one of the bandits, sir.
He says, it is important for him and for you.
20 years ago I passed the castle, when I saw a handsome boy at the lake.
I made him follow me into the dark forest.
Act Six
The others wanted to kill him, but I took pity on him.
So your son became mine.
He forgot you and honored me as his father.
And I thought he had drowned, because his hat floated on the lake.
God, my son is alive.
Bring him to me, even though he is a bandid, I thank you.
He is here, he is the stranger that found shelter here.
Jaromir, my brother!
Tumble, you pillars of earth, the son has killed his father.
I am not your son?
Look at this ground, you walk on your ancestors' heritage, you are a Count Borodin.
Light at the chapel?
I want to see, see, see, even if I should perish.
All sins will be forgiven, but not patricide.
Berta, Berta, escape with me.
I am not your Berta.
Illusion from hell, You are not my Berta.
Everything in vain, I will not let you.
This is Berta's face and there is my place!
Part in peace, you peaceless.
In the film, Robert Reinert wanted to describe the atmosphere that prevailed in 1919 as a "nervous explosive"
caused by war and misery.
The film was modified several times by the censors.
The copy distributed at first in 1919 was 2637 meters long.
In November 1920, the Office of Censorship in Berlin had a copy that was 2054 meters long.
Gosfilmofond in Moscow has a black and white copy 1646 meters long, and the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv has a colorized fragment 65 meters long.
Approximately 777 meters of a U.S. version, whose colors are deteriorating and have a solarized effect, are kept at the Library of Congress.
A third version of has been lost.
Our reconstruction efforts have tried to be faithful to the original concept of the film.
Therefore some shots and sequences were swapped and new headings added.
Colorization reconstruction meets models and conventions of the time.
Only a few of the "animated intertitles"
You, messengers of the most intense pleasure and suffering the deepest!
When you come to fail, Man is reduced to a beast,
Nerves are you not the essence of the soul?
Prologue
A thousand miles from home your son is now dying.

"Our invention, the largest in living memory, will make us masters of the world!"
"With our tools and machines designed to overcome resistance, we will conquer the whole Earth.
The whole Earth.
"The fluttering flag symbolizes the beginning of our reign."
"Start the machine.
Raise the flag!"
The machine explodes and destroys the new plant.
"Like me, you must have nerves of steel. Otherwise, all is lost."
Panic
Roloff will no longer dominate the world.
"I will continue to fight!"
Professor Johannes, an apostle of the people.
Marja, Roloff's sister
"A gap has widened between the haves and the have nots."
"They seek power, while you ask for bread!"
"People are crying from the bloody battlefields."
"This is the culmination of this thirst for power, This hideous monster who wanders the earth drunk with blood."
"But you tremble ..."
"Growing up, I had nerves of steel but since that time ..."
"Since I see the dead coming back to take their revenge against us ... against me."
"Hey, Marja, your wedding dress."
"Happy child, tomorrow you'll be married!"
"Don't you feel the air is filled with a mysterious power?"
"Don't you feel the Earth vibrate with an unspeakable force?"
"I have to go and see for myself."
"Oh, if only the marriage would not take place."
"Do you know what it means to marry someone you do not love?"
"I want to belong to a man who has a soul:
A man like Professor Johannes!"
The assistant gardener
"What's going on?"
The street rises.
"And you, what are you doing?"
"You coward!"
"Butonlyyouinterestme!"
"Let me go, I want to be with them!"
"Have mercy, Marja!
"These people are fighting for their lives.
And you know nothing else to do, only to turn around, sentimentally weeping, you coward!"
Count Richard Colonna, Marja's fiance
"Tomorrow morning, you will give the bouquet to the bride!"
"Am I a coward?"
"No, I am not a coward!"
"I do not know."
"Shoot him!"
"We have also lost our second son!"
"How could this happen?"
"I didn't know this would happen!"
"Blood flows on my wedding day!"
End of Act One.
Act Two
Marja's wedding day
Richard: "Did the assistant gardener finally hand her my bouquet?"
Marja: "This is not a murderer. Give him a religious burial."
Richard: "He does not deserve it."
The blind sister of Professor Johannes.
"Your little sister is looking for you, Professor Johannes!"
"Mother, why you are no longer alive?
You could advise me?"
Matthew 5.28: "And I tell you:
Whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her, in his heart.
"My brother, I cannot see you, but I feel how much you suffer."
The wedding guests
"Professor Johannes - I'm getting married today."
"IthinkI'llbevery unhappy..."
"Do you remember when you were my teacher?"
"You gave me this animal When there are workers who die of hunger."
"I was happy at the time.
Today I am in despair."
"Marja, go!
Please."
"Marja has disappeared."
"I will never marry Count Richard Colonna."
"My God, what has happened to you?"
"Richard, I cannot be your wife."
"No man of honor can take me as a wife."
"Anotherwouldhavetotake meby force ..."
"Professor Johannes!"
"We'll talk!"
"My sister did not get married."
"I'll explain later."
Roloff urged Marja to tell him what happened.
"Marja, overcome your shame.
Tell me ..."
"I lost consciousness in his arms ..."
Roloff is sure her nerves are raw, having seen the scene with his own eyes.
The love I bear for him is unclean and full of sin.
"This professor must be destroyed!"
How can love, the most beautiful of feelings, be so powerful?
"Mr. Prosecutor, this dramatic incident has the advantage of destroying our most dangerous political opponent!"
The faithful dog
"This is not true!"
"This cannot be true!"
"I swear to God, I saw it with my own eyes."
End of Act Two
Act Three
"Johannes?"
The people
"My faithful dog, tell me where to find our Johannes?"
Night
"Marja, for the love of Christ, tell me the truth!"
"ProfessorJohannespossessedme. "
Popular rally
An argument broke out.
He: "Let us not be misled by ruthless fanatics!"
Intuitively, the blind girl feels there was a relationship between the Bible and her brother.
"Who are you?"
"I'm closer to you than you think ..."
"On the day of trial I will prove his innocence."
Thedayof thetrial
"You will apologize for being ill.
The shame of your presence at court would be a disgrace to the family."
No longer find peace
"He was sentenced to six years in prison!"
"I feel as if I have attended the execution of an innocent person!"
"An unbearable tension reigned in the courtroom."
"He refused to pronounce any word in his defense."
"Given the terrible accusations, he remained silent."
"Then his blind sister came forward."
"My brother is a good man.
He reads the Bible every day."
Whoever looks at a woman in lust has already committed adultery with her, in his heart.
"Thischildwhothoughtshewassaving herbrother unintentionallycondemnedhim."
The love I bear him is unclean and full of sin.
"I assume you're referring to Marja Roloff!"
"You confess then to an illicit love for Marja Roloff from long ago?"
"Your silence will be fatal!"
"Then I swore."
"I swore I saw the scene with my own eyes."
"The verdict pronounced, Johannes broke his silence."
"I am wrongfully convicted, but I'll do my penance."
End of Act Three
Act Four
"Professor Johannes was sentenced to six years in prison!"
"Didn't you see him stare at me?"
"It's unbearable!"
"Why did he say anything?"
"Why was he convicted?"
"Herapedyou."
"Johannes would never do such a thing."
"But I saw it with my own eyes."
"My poor brother.
You saw nothing."
"Yes, I did see.
I even testified."
It is impossible for you to have seen anything."
"Tell me the truth?"
Johannespossessedmy soul.
Hedidnotphysicallypossess me."
"I saw it and I testifed to it.
And now she says ...
Am I a fool or a criminal?"
"What's going on there?"
"We aren't saying anything.
Marja must be silent since I have testified so!"
"But you cannot let an innocent man suffer!"
"I committed perjury.
I am a notorious liar."
"I went to the prosecutor.
You must do what your honor requires."
"Another inquest will shed full light on this matter."
Marja leaves the house, resolved to fight for the Johannes's ideas.
"Where am I?"
"Is this my house?"
"Help, help!"
"Help me.
I'm afraid of going insane!"
Wishing to have a clear conscience, Roloff consults a well-known psychiatrist.
"I have a friend who suffers strange hallucinations.
"The worst thing is that he blames himself."
"He gives the impression of being very healthy."
"Here, everyone seems in good health, but all are seriously ill."
"What is the cause of their illness?"
"The progress of civilization, the struggle for survival, fear and the horrors of war, the sins of the parents ..."
"What do you want?
What do you have against me?"
"Why are you crying?"
"You make us feel pity!"
"Nonsense!
You cry for your idol Johannes, whom I arrested."
Our marriage, my dear son, was not happy.

"My God, I think that is Elizabeth, my wife."
"If she is dead, it is your fault."
"Nobody ever died as he did."
"Nobody ever went to heaven as he did."
"I am not a murderer.
He committed suicide."
"Is he dead then?"
"His body is visible?"
"He was here, right here."
"Do not cry, I cannot stand it when you cry."

"Nobody knows why I remained silent."
"I wanted to atone for my sins."
"Forgive me, Johannes!"
"My responsibility for what happened to you is heavier than yours."
Richard seeks Marja, his fiancee, and eventually finds her.
Richard: "Marja, just turn the page and move on.
Like you, I left everything.
Henceforth, I will also defend your noble ideas."

"Now I know why he was silent."
A few days later
Roloff's condition worsens.
"What unhappiness I brought."
"Why are you laughing, you whore?"
"Go as quickly as possible.
I want escape the images that haunt me."
"I choked!
Now death awaits me, too."

Will you have me under your roof?"
This unclouded happiness ends in a strange and unexpected manner.
Roloff's newspaper
His love for Elizabeth stops him.
Why remain living?
I, the unlucky one, will sacrifice for their happiness.
"He knew.
That is why he chose death."
"... and I killed him ..."

"Iprayon my kneesuntilImeetthee,O Lord. "
Elizabeth asked for advice from Marja.
Marja: "Only a magnanimous act will let you reclaim his heart."
In her extreme confusion, Marja chose a terrible act.
"My poor sister is sure to perish in the flames!"
Elizabeth dared not confess her act.
She disappears without a trace.
Richard dies in a street fight.
Richard: "I must make a confession.
For love of you, Marja, I defended ideas which I have never believed in."
Marja:
"Everything is a lie in this world?
Even the ideals?
Why go on living?"
I set fire to the castle causing the death of your sister.
I entered the convent to do penance there.
Marja committed suicide.
Johannes was called to the side of the dying.
"Forgive me again, Johannes.
I pay with my life for that I made you undergo.
I never stopped loving you."
"I think of the ideals that I have defended and for what I'm dying!"

The good Madame Daughter has gone stark raving mad.
Why exactly are you throwing all these noisy newspapers at my head?
Well, the vases have already all been broken.
It's come to our attention that the daughter of the shoe-polish king, Mr. Blakpott, has married a count.
That doesn't impress me at all.
I'll buy you a prince.
I'm so happy I could smash the whole house to pieces.
Seligson the matchmaker.

For that price they've all got a little flaw.

You shouldn't handle any child like that!
Well, children really shouldn't be coddled.
Now you've got to apply some powder.
Not on the face?
It all goes on the other end.
Well that's pretty odd.
We haven't got to that point yet.
Someone's ringing.
I'm sure someone was outside pressing the button.
I'll check to see if we're home.
I'd like to speak with Prince Nucki about a matter of the heart.
I'll check to see if His Highness will receive you.

His Highness bids you to come in.
Don't fall over
Your Highness, I have a proposal for you... a charming young girl... .
This tall!
...and does she have hair...
black as night... .
I go for blondes.
Then she'll just dye it:
With that kind of money it makes no difference.
Your Little Highness!
My adjutant will look her over first.
Put on my suit, so you look presentable.
It's now been 1-1/2 hours, and I still haven't got any husband.

Be my guest!

Josef presents himself to Quaker.
Might I have your card?
Take this one for the time being.
What do you have to say about that, Daddy... that the prince is here?
He's to wait in the parlour.
If you come to an agreement, wake me.
These folks know how to live!
Josef grows impatient.
Where is the good madame?
In the bath!
- And the good gentleman?
Asleep!
Well what am I supposed to do with myself here?
Wait!
His Highness the Prince is growing impatient.
The good madame in person.

Smells good.
Good Lord he looks dumb.
Oh well, he is a prince after all.
So you want to marry me?
Is that what you want or isn't it? !
Of course that's what I want... just don't throw anything.
Don't you want to introduce me to your father first?
Since it's such a trifle, we don't want to wake him up.
On the way to the ceremony.
We'd like to get married quick.
Prince Nucki, do you take Ms. Quaker to be your wife?
You don't even have to ask... he's got nothing to say on the matter.
But didn't I get to sit up front earlier?
Yes, but we werert married yet then.
Tell the servants that I am your husband.
They wouldn't buy it.
I hereby introduce you to my husband.
Well you see how pleased they are.
Go into my father's bedroom and introduce yourself.
What's the nearest route to Mr. Quaker's bedroom?
I'll provide you with a blueprint of the manor.

Excuse me for introducing you to my son-in-law.
Don't be such a pig!
Say a few words.
It's been a long time since I've had such a good meal.
In the course of the celebration, a foxtrot epidemic suddenly breaks out.
Not so exuberant... think about your family tree.
Oh bollocks!
Do you foxtrot?
What will your husband the prince have to say about this?
I could do with a wedding like this every day.
Every day pickled herring... that's bitter.
Nucki is called upon by his friends to go for a stroll.
Would you perhaps be able to lend me a little something?
The wedding nears its end.
I'm sweating like an ape.
Everyone sweats as he's able.
Whereabouts is your husband?
I'm so very happy.
Why did you get married then?
Shame on you! ...
Why you're...
I'm so very happy!
What can be done, will be done.

...and so I say, in closing:
"Down with dipsomania!"
If consulting hours aren't held soon, the patients will sober up on their own.
The associatiors patients.
A shame about the sclönen schnapps.
Hold onto me tightly, my ladies.
Everyone out.
I'll cure him.
No!
Alright then... we'll settle the matter with a boxing match.
Let go of me, my ladies!
Fight, fight.
So now it's your turn.
Bring the gentleman to my car:
I'm taking him on a private session.
Put the gentleman in my husband's bedroom.
The good master is still asleep.
Then take him into my bedroom.
Mousey.
Little Mousey.
Shut it!
Well if that doesn't just take the biscuit!
I'm telling the old man about this.
These aren't my trousers.
Do you have any idea where you are?
With you!
Well do you know who I am?
A sweet little snail.
Do you know that you're a delightful kisser?
Well I never!
A pity that you're married.
I have to get married too.
Do you know that you're both married to one another?
I got married in your name.
The real wedding.
NOW THAT IMPRESSES ME.
This man has been brought to me as one who misleads the people.
My Lord Governor there is a custom in Jerusalem, that at this season of the feast one condemned man should be released.
I remember the custom.
This man who many of you call their king?
-Release Jesus of Nazareth!
-No, not Barabbas!
-Barabbas!
-Release Barabbas!
They"re mad, Lord Governor. Barabbas is a rebel.
A robber, an assassin.
All right, that"s enough.
One man to be set free.
Set free?
The Governor offered them either the prophet or you.
He listened to the voices and they chose you.
I make no comment. Come on.
It ought to be lucky, considering how things have gone for you.
I"m not used to the light. lt plays tricks.
If I was you, I shouldn"t loiter.
I"d want to see the back of this place before they change their minds.
Get on your way, will you?
-Who do you think you"re shoving?
-Get going.
All right. I"m going.
-Get out of the way.
What are you all hanging around for?
Here"s a fine sight.
Six weeks and nobody"s moved.
What"s happened then?
This is a surprise, let me tell you.
is that my duck? It"s him!
-Sara!
-There"s the black knave himself...
I was released to celebrate the holiday as a surprise for you.
Here"s a day to celebrate in all my god.
You"ve not heard?
I"m the choice of the people.
""Give us Barabbas,"" they said.
Give me some food.
Food for Barabbas. Food for a hungry man.
How did you feel when they told you?
Old Sara here dropping tears so fast all the slopping wine got watered.
-Where did you get your luck?
-What witch gave you that?
-Touch him for luck. That"s it.
-l"m not taking chances.
Get away.
Where"s Rachel?
Fetch her down here.
She"s no good for you or anyone else.
-She"s completely changed, I"m telling you.
-What"s wrong with her?
Bring her down.
She"s no good to my old rascal now.
She thinks of nothing, day or night except this prophet from Nazareth, who"s on trial for blasphemy.
Ever since she heard him preach, she has gone off her life like a sick child goes off its food.
Come on, you old empty belly.
There"s no food inside you worth vomiting.
Barabbas, that girl"s no good for you.
Bewitched by a prophet.
And she"s gone to his trial looking like a widow already.
That"s the end of him.
-Condemned, was he?
-That"s just it.
They had the choice between him and me, and they chose me.
How do you like that?
The idol of the city.
Tell you what. You"re as good as a king, Barabbas.
They call the prophet King of the Jews, but they chose you.
-Let"s have a crowning of him.
-The wicked old King of Judea.
-Come on, give him his robes.
-You be nice to your King Barabbas.
More wives than Solomon and his subjects as ripe as old pumpkins.
Here"s your scepter. Take it.
-What"s that?
-That"s the scepter.
Kneel down, all you miserable scum of the earth, and acknowledge.
Kneel down, you scum of the earth.
Hail! Hail!
I"ll make laws for you that will tax your constitutions.
What are you treating me like a clown for?
Look here, Rachel, look who"s been asking for you.
What"s the matter with me?
Why don"t you look at me?
Not until you"ve told me you"re glad I"m alive.
-l wouldn"t wish any man his death.
Don"t make me speak to you.
-Don"t make me speak to you.
That"s a warm welcome.
I couldn"t follow any further.
I daren"t say what is still to come, but God forgive us all if he can.
What did I tell you?
She"s no good to you now, Barabbas.
I"m not here to be made a fool of.
What"s the matter?
Remember how it used to be.
Barabbas, don"t you see what"s happening?
Don"t you understand what set you free?
That"s what"s happened.
-l"m not the same. Nothing is the same.
-You"d better try and make it the same.
For pity"s sake believe me.
He came from God, the man who"s taking your place.
You think I should have been killed instead of him?
That"s none of my worry.
God can look after his own.
-And you can look after me.
That girl up there was always coming back with strange ideas.
She"s got her head full of them.
Well, it seems she"s got something to think about now, anyway.
-l don"t like the look of it.
-Look of what?
What"s the matter?
The light"s gone out of it.
I"ve never known it dark like this in the middle of the day.
Get a light, for mercy"s sake.
Something"s wrong with my eyes.
I can"t see.
Something"s wrong.
Everything"s black.
I knew there was something wrong when I saw that light.
What"s happening?
You know what has happened.
Even the light has left us, now that we"ve killed him.
He"s dead.
Just the same as any other man.
-We"ve seen it.
That"s the end of it.
-He promised to come back.
We shall see that, too.
Only two days and he"ll be in the world again.
I tell you, you"re mad.
That"s the end of it.
Can"t you hear me?
What"s the matter with you?
What"s the matter?
Then today"s the third day?
What"s so odd?
We"ll see, then.
This is the morning of the third day.
Now you know it"s true.
-Who moved the stone?
-God moved it.
You saw him do it?
-First there was the music of a horn.
-Horn?
He stretched out his arm. It seemed as long as a spear.
The point of the spear went between the stone and the rock and the stone rolled away.
If only you had been here sooner and seen what I saw.
My eyes are good.
The Master was a man of truth, and he said this would be so.
Did you see a prophet come out of the tomb?
My eyes were so dazzled.
I think I must have covered them.
But when I could see again a man and a woman were together in the garden.
And the man was the same man they buried in there?
The morning light was behind him.
But I"m sure it was he.
Shadows, light, that"s about the truth of it.
Here"s the truth of it:
Why do you think he should lie about himself when it meant he would be killed?
How do you know what he said?
The priests ought to know more than you do. And they call it blasphemy.
""Love one another.""
""Love one another""?
And they crucified him for that?
There are those who can tell you more.
There"s a house in the street of the potters where they meet.
It"s a trick they"re playing.
Are you afraid of knowing what has happened?
Are you looking for someone?
The clay making itself?
What"s happened? I heard there was news.
The tomb"s empty, the women said they saw him.
Creed can have strange visions. Only it"s true.
Where"s Peter?
Don"t open it.
Can we hide from the future forever?
Let"s see what is here.
What if they mean to destroy us all?
I"m not afraid of that.
-What have you done with him?
-What do you want with us?
-The truth.
What happened?
-What right have you to be here?
-What is the truth of this morning?
-l know the truth.
You think we might have hidden it here among us.
But something else has happened.
If you find him here, it will only be if he comes himself.
Don"t you believe it. I saw the body.
If you were sure of that, you wouldn"t be here.
He"s risen.
I trust in him and wait.
You"re all mad.
What do you think you"re doing, making that net?
There"s no sea to fish in closer than Galilee.
It"s what I"m used to doing, my hands go to it.
He said that in the future our fish would be men.
It was a serious joke. It meant he"d given us the word to draw men out of the dark sea into the light.
Do I have to tell you what happens to the fish?
They struggle about, gasp and die.
You said something good.
That"s where men have the advantage over fish.
They can die to the world, die to the dark sea and begin to live again in the light.
That"s what he promised, and what he promised has happened.
But what has happened we still don"t know.
He"s come back to life.
-He"ll lead us to the new kingdom.
-l"ll believe it when he"s before us.
When I can touch him and hear him.
You"re always full of doubts without any cause.
No cause to doubt that a dead man can come back to life?
I can take you now to talk with a man who was dead.
The Master brought him back to life.
You needn"t be afraid.
Here"s someone wants to question you.
I"ll leave you with him.
You can ask him whatever you like.
They told me death is not.... ls not death.
They brought me here to see because you could make me believe it.
Because you were dead, and were raised from the dead by the man.
That is true.
I was dead.
And I know that he is Christ the Son of God who has power over life and death.
What"s it like there?
-Tell me what it"s like.
-Like?
-Like? -Yes, what is it this thing you experienced?
What is it?
I have experienced nothing.
And death is nothing.
What should it be?
How would you tell an unborn child what life is?
But it isn"t anything.
To those who"ve been there nothing else is anything either.
No one has asked me this before.
They have listened how life came back to me and gone away praising.
Only you have asked about death.
And none the wiser.
We"re two men who might be dead.
Sharing his body.
Listen, everybody!
That"s the word.
-Leave me alone. I want to sit.
-What do you want to do, sit and think?
It"s no good thinking.
Come on, let"s go and find a new life.
-Where are you going, Barabbas?
-To see what ""brought back to life"" means.
-Come on.
-My shoe.
-Hey! Get up!
-Leave it alone.
It"s all you have to do.
It"s not my fault they let him get killed.
You can"t hang it around my neck.
I"ve as much right to be alive as any of you.
You"re afraid to look at me because I"m alive.
It may be today that the new world comes.
Today or tomorrow.
Every day you have promised us, it has never come.
-lt will never come.
-lt will come. I know it.
Please, Rachel, tell us again what it will be like.
You"d better mind what you say.
Don"t you know what can happen to you if they hear you?
Anybody now caught spreading such stories the Son of God, the Messiah and such, is to be judged an enemy of the State and stoned until he"s dead.
Or some blue, like the color of the sky.
Pain and sorrow will sink into the ground, and everything will be made new because the Son of God has risen from the dead.
There"s no truth in any of it.
She doesn"t know the difference between what is real and what she dreamed in her sleep.
Don"t you listen to her.
She"s raking up trouble.
Nothing but trouble.
Trouble for you if you won"t turn and listen to the sounds that have come.
How can you see or hear what"s to come?
He"s right. lt"s dangerous talk.
They"ll pull down our homes, drive us out.
Better listen to this man.
-Let"s hear what the prophet said.
-Don"t leave.
To where the lepers are, to tell them to be ready for the freedom that"s coming.
-She"s going among the lepers!
-Stop her!
She"s going to set the lepers free.
-Don"t let her go among the lepers!
-Don"t let her set the lepers free!
You have no right to go among the lepers!
Look out, it"s a temple guard!
We don"t want the lepers to be free!
A charge has been lodged against this woman.
-She must be questioned.
-We heard she preaches blasphemy.
Bring her to the temple and we will judge her.
-Take your dirty hands off her.
-Don"t take her! She"s done no wrong.
Don"t take her away.
For stirring up evil matters among the people for misleading their minds and denying the wisdom of authority.
For her sins, she has been condemned to death by stoning.
Let the man who accused her and was found just in his accusation cast the first stone.
-l"ve nothing against her.
-You accused her.
-The law gives you the first stone.
-lt was you.
Or you"ll find yourself there beside her.
Throw quickly. lf you wait, I may be afraid.
You don"t have to think of Barabbas any more.
He"s not coming back.
And if he did, we"d know what to do with him.
You"re still afraid of him because he used to roar at you like a brass bull.
You can"t stand up to him even when he"s gone.
He"s gone to the devil once and for all, I can tell you.
He"s lost his nerve.
He"s creeping about the city like a shivering priest.
Why do you think he"s not come back?
Because he"s afraid to stir hand or foot.
-We don"t know yet, he won"t come back.
-Who cares if he does?
We"ll soon see it then.
So, you remembered the way to get here.
You"ll find things altered.
What"s over is over.
God"s curse on you!
The money is sacred! It belongs to the temple!
-The god of battle will destroy you!
-Blasphemy!
You hypocrites. I"ll kill you both.
Here"s all the treasure we wanted. Come away!
I"ll kill you the way you had her killed.
It seemed to me at the time, Barabbas, when you were given your liberty before it wasn"t a fortunate exchange.
This is what I thought and this is what has occurred.
By that I mean you and your life.
They"re dying because of that.
This is a local matter, which I hope will soon be adjusted.
The shock and fear of an unreasoning fanaticism will pass.
But the appetite to destroy which, alas, the human being shares with the wild beast, is always with us.
And it has rigorously to be disciplined in the name of civilization...
-...and according to the law.
-That"s what you say.
But I tell you, whichever side of the law we"re on, we"re the same men.
What we haven"t got, we go out and take.
Let him speak.
Whoever"s against us or gets in our way, we get rid of.
They"ve split thousands upon thousands.
If I"ve taken a passing woman to myself your armies have looted and raped across continents.
I was born by a girl thrown out of a brothel who gave birth and cursed me before she died.
The law is the pass and permit to life in this world.
You were without it.
However, the law here tells me that a man released by the will of the people at a holy festival cannot thereafter be given a capital punishment.
You can"t kill me?
I sentence you to transportation for life, whatever that"s worth to the sulfur mines on the island of Sicily.
I can"t be killed.
Deliberately he did it.
He died in my place.
He"s taken my death.
That"s it. He"s taken my death.
That light, that wasn"t light.
The dark, that wasn"t dark. That wasn"t dark, that was life.
-That was life.
-Take the man away.
You"ll die and rot, but I"ll live forever!
I"ve got my life and you can"t take it!
I"ve got my life and you can"t have it!
I"ve got my life!
-Well, which are you?
-l"m Scorpus.
That means nothing, idiot.
What"s your number?
-563.
-That"s better.
-Who"s the god?
-The divine Emperor Tiberius.
You have the privilege of being his property.
That"s all.
They"re sending us down to the next level to make room for you.
That"s how you know how long you"ve been here by how deep you"re down.
They break you in gradually to get used to the dark.
You"ve gotten used to the dark.
Did it take long?
It"s got into me.
You"re blind.
Sulfur burns.
You"ve got a partner there that seems to know how to live forever.
Tiberius?
That was long ago.
Here, I"m called Sahak.
That"s mine.
You don"t care how I got here but I"ll tell you.
The ship I was serving on took on a cargo of slaves.
So, the captain put the chains on me.
What about your world?
What"s your name?
-l asked you what your name is.
-All right.
If it"s going to keep you quiet.
What"s the town you came from?
Are you the man they acquitted?
Chained to you, of all men on Earth.
That"s what I like to see, devils and beasts going for each other"s throats.
Here"s a head of you to hate each other.
Let"s see you working.
Get out!
You hate the sound of it.
You weren"t even in Jerusalem, but you hate my name.
That"s right.
What does it matter to you?
-You know who was killed in your place?
-Still that?
So, why shouldn"t we hate your name?
I thought what he said was to love one another.
I can"t imagine he expects a man to have a spirit as strong and patient as a dray horse.
It was only something I was told.
If you think I got the best of it, you stay here for a generation or two.
We"ve got a special duty for you two.
This"ll show you what happens to fighting mongrels. Come on.
Why isn"t it all forgotten?
That"s what I don"t understand.
Who"s been spreading things about?
What could kill it?
When you think it was God"s will come to Earth to show what he is.
I can see the reality of that.
Which is why the name of the Master goes on growing in the world.
I began to meet it wherever I sailed:
Phoenicia, Cyprus, Greece.
I began to understand what it meant.
But it"s a tough demand, the will of God.
I"m a poor hand at it.
And look where l"ve got us now.
Even though I"ve got his sign scratched on the back of the Emperor"s head.
It means I belong to him, not to the Emperor.
It"s the sign he has put on us all, if we give way enough to see it.
There"s the shape of the cross.
Why did you come here and rake up old lies about killing God?
What"s going on down there?
Move yourselves or I"ll leave you to rot.
You think what it"s like to me.
You"re the only man I"ve met who saw him.
You were there at the beginning, and you won"t talk.
You won"t tell me.
-What are you afraid of?
-Nothing I"m afraid of.
You see the darkness that went over heaven and Earth when he died?
Suppose l did.
The man died in a dust storm, the same as anybody"s death.
Can"t a dead man be taken away?
I"ll give it to you.
That"s all of your God you"ll get out of me.
Here, what"s the matter?
Come on, get up.
If they see you can"t work they take you and you won"t come back.
-Come on. Move out, all of you. -Get on your feet.
You"ve had your sleep.
-You two, get your feet on the ground.
-Get out of there.
All right, there"s work to be done.
-You"ve had enough sleep now.
You, over there.
Wake up, you hear me?
-Get on your feet, I say.
-One dead man here.
-You"ve got to look as if you can work.
-What"s the matter with you?
You can"t stand up?
Can"t work?
Here, this one"s no use.
-How many survivors? -None, sir.
There can"t be any.
-lt was like the end of the world to them.
-The end of the underworld.
-What did you say, sir?
Get ready to receive survivors!
When they"ve recovered, put them to work in the fields.
I can taste the salt in the air.
I thought I could never love it better than I did.
After the darkness of the mines I could go and drown in it like a man besotted.
Like a damned ox?
Salt me down and I"d praise God even for this.
How many times were you swindled in those foreign ports?
You must"ve been the easiest game they ever got their hands on.
-Why is that?
-You"d fall for any trick.
One smile and you trust the world that half kills you.
Yes, I trust it.
Every time he came near, you refused to believe it.
But it"s never been out of your mind.
What other man"s death could have troubled you so long?
Stop there.
Pull over to the side.
Rock to be carried.
It"s a poor scratching, but the true sign.
All right, we go on.
Send for them, Rufio. I want to see them.
-Bring those men over here to us.
-Very good, sir.
These two. Take them off the plough.
Twenty years in the mines, the old one. Indestructible.
I heard so.
You"ve earned the air you breathe, you two, by sheer good fortune.
-What are your names?
-Sahak, sir.
-And yours?
-Barabbas.
What"s your age?
What does it matter?
Indeed, what should it matter?
I must touch them for the luck that"s in them.
All right, we don"t want to hold up the work.
Back now.
It"s from the Emperor.
We"re to call to Rome.
-To Rome?
-l"m to enter the Senate.
-We"re to rise in the world.
-Rufio. Rome!
It"s true. They are charmed.
We must always take them with us.
I see, their success, not mine.
Nothing but amiable days from now on, and knowing everybody instead of nobody.
-When shall we go?
-Ride with us. I"ll give you the answer.
How wretched to arrive when all have gone to the mountains....
Look over there.
They cannot fight yet. They must first learn the skill.
And so they will.
Let"s hope they won"t disgrace us.
When a charmed life turns professional, we can expect great things.
You honor Rome and us.
Unsurpassable.
The Emperor has given him his freedom three times.
There"s the third staff of liberty in his hand.
Keep it he does.
He"s taken a fair toll of them.
I"ll take this life.
Can"t a man be made mad by the smell of blood?
A man can understand this.
Your places now.
One here, you here and you over there.
What"s this?
Have they mistaken this place for an old men"s hospital?
The gray-haired one?
They say there"s something remarkable about him.
Show me what you can do, grandfather.
What do we do with aging fish, grandfather?
It"s time he was thrown to the gulls.
You drew the sign of the Master beside my plate.
Several days I"ve watched you breaking the bread.
He was there in Jerusalem. He knew the Master.
God be praised and keep you safe.
The days have been getting darker for us.
Persecution increasing.
The Emperor wants to destroy every trace of us.
The Master"s disciple, Peter, is here in Rome.
Seldom enough I find my way there, some way off to the catacombs.
Surely it"s the dead who meet there.
-Did you hear him, Barabbas?
-l heard.
One, two, one, two....
To your fighting places.
When you"ve taken up these positions tomorrow the trumpets will sound.
And from above you, there the white cloth will be thrown into the arena.
-That"s an angry crowd.
-They want blood.
They were driven to a frenzy by Sahak, who wouldn"t kill his man.
If the Emperor were here, he wouldn"t have had a choice.
He"ll get his quota of killing, if you"re lucky to win.
-Not one life will he get from me.
-Won"t he?
Say that to the Emperor.
He will teach you the ways.
-When he says death, death it is.
-The true God says life.
-l only answer to him.
-Hark at this man.
By God, if he contradicts the Emperor....
-Who do you call your God?
-The only one.
The rest are inventions of fear, tales taken from the past they can no more help you than this breast can bleed.
Put "em down.
-insulting the gods before we go fight.
-What revenge will Mars take?
None at all. He doesn"t exist.
Mars doesn"t exist?
What do you mean, he doesn"t exist?
The real God is greater than any man"s thoughts can imagine.
Your gods are as shallow as a reeking pond.
He"s above us and around us, in us.
The law is love.
And so that we should see what his love is he sent his son to live the life of a man.
To show that God understands the life he has made.
-Who spun you this?
-What do you want us to do?
What good will he do us in the arena?
We"ll lose the goodwill of the gods we know.
Tomorrow in the arena, show the Emperor that we know what life"s worth.
If anything"s beyond belief, that is.
God said, ""Burn away the old world...
""...and let a new one rise from the ashes.""
As the Son of God rose from the dead, he died for us.
Saw him die.
Was there, in the garden, on the third morning.
You saw him, Barabbas?
-Tell us what you saw.
-What happened?
A long time ago I saw a man.
Some people say he was...
-...the Son of God.
You"ve condemned yourselves.
I charge you with sedition and stirring up mutiny.
You"re both under arrest.
Take them out and put them in chains.
Let me be sure you understand the seriousness of the charge against you.
Not only with holding views proscribed by the State for which the punishment is death, but of recommending those views to men sworn to the State"s service.
What is more, you"ve betrayed your faith to me who brought you to this city and laid me under possible suspicion of connivance in the eyes of the Emperor.
You know what this is?
-The stamp of the Roman State.
-Which means that you"re Rome"s property.
What"s this cut here?
-Who do you call your master?
-The one who is my lord.
-The Son of the Father.
-ln other words, the Christian sign?
A religion which sets itself up to menace government and order.
Which denies the divine authority of the Emperor.
Which preaches that the slave is equal to the free man and would reduce society to anarchy.
Do you belong to the State?
I belong to the Lord, my god.
You don"t?
Isn"t he your god?
Isn"t that what the inscription means?
I have no god.
I don"t understand.
Because I tried to believe.
I"ll give you the opportunity to recover your senses.
If you"ll admit publicly to the men you spoke to that all these things were lies, you may save your life.
But isn"t life dear to you?
Yes, it is.
You"re as mad as your god.
Unwise to carry around with you what you don"t believe in.
Some other purpose, Barabbas.
-Something else.
-Take him away.
Now you"ll have to be worth two men to take his place.
An iniquitous crime against the State.
Long live the Emperor!
Proceed, Torvald.
Positions.
You"ll wish this was better done.
Gladiator Barabbas, you"re becoming quite a legend among us, I hear.
For your remarkable persistence in life we have a traditional answer to this public acclaim.
I brought him to you.
This is where he would have wanted to be buried.
Did he have to die before you cared about him?
You were willing to let him go to his death alone.
Why should you help him now he doesn"t need you?
How could I have helped him by being killed?
-There was something I still had to do.
-Barabbas, why should you believe it?
When the light shone, you wouldn"t accept it.
When the dark came, you denied it.
When the spirit of God beckoned, you refused it.
You believe it because it suits you.
Jesus of Nazareth was killed instead of me.
Why did he choose me?
For God"s sake, where are you?
I"m lost!
-What"s happening?
-Rome is burning.
Can"t you see?
-What happened to make the fire?
-The Christians tried to burn down Rome.
-Move!
Move that case. Come on.
-Christians?
-The Christians are burning Rome!
-lt"s the Christians!
They"re burning away the old world.
You won"t find me failing this time.
The hour has come when all is to perish.
-Are you a Christian?
And I"m ready for Him!
We"re burning the way.
We"re ready for his coming.
-Take him away.
-The Master!
-The Master"s coming to build a new world.
-Away!
Here"s one of your kind who was caught in the act, setting light to a storehouse.
He admits he"s a Christian, burning the city to start a new kingdom.
The only honest man among you.
We"ve never seen you before.
Were you setting fire to a storehouse?
-We"ve never seen you before.
My name is Barabbas.
-Barabbas, the robber.
-Barabbas, the acquitted.
This burning city is no work of ours.
This isn"t how the new kingdom is going to be made.
Who are you to tell me I"m wrong?
You asked me why I was making a net so far from the sea.
Jerusalem.
You were mistaken of us then as you are again now.
We didn"t set fire to the city.
You"ve done the work of the wild beast, the Emperor.
-Are you a lunatic?
-lt was his fire, you fool, not God"s.
Why can"t God make himself plain?
What"s become of all the fine hopes?
Every time I"ve seen it end up the same way, with torments and dead bodies with no good come of it.
Do you think they persecute us to destroy nothing?
Or do you think that what has battered on your soul for twenty years has been nothing?
It wasn"t for nothing that Christ died.
Mankind isn"t nothing.
In his eyes, each individual man is the whole world.
He loves each man as though there were no other.
I was the opposite of everything he taught, wasn"t l?
Why did he let himself be killed instead of me?
Because being farthest from him, you were the nearest.
-l"m no nearer than I was before.
-Nor any farther away.
The truth of the matter is, he"s never moved from your side.
There has been a wrestling in your spirit, back and forth in your life which in itself is knowledge of God. By the conflict you have known him.
I can tell you as well, that so it will be with the coming of the kingdom.
That wrestling back and forth and the laboring of the world spirit like a woman in childbirth.
We won"t see the time when the Earth is full of the kingdom.
The kingdom is within us.
There is nothing more to fear.
Upon us, the years will be built.
The ground of men is very stubborn to mature.
""God"s speed.""
The sixth hour goes when darkness....
Darkness....
l give myself up into your keeping.
THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI
Photographed by Willy Hameister
ACT I
There are spirits...
They are all around us...
They have driven me from hearth and home, from wife and child...
That is my fiancée...
What she and I have lived through is stranger still than what you have lived through...
I will tell you about it.
The little town where I was born...
The annual fair.
Alan, my friend.
SPECIAL EDITION: FAIR IN HOLSTENWALL -
FOR THE FIRST TIME ENTERTAINMENTS OF EVERY VARIETY
Come on, Franzis, let's go to the fair!
Don't go inside, the town clerk is in a vile temper today!
I wish to apply for a permit to present my spectacle at the fair...
What kind of spectacle...?
A somnambulist.
Step rrrrright up!

SOMNAMBULISM
A Collected Edition by the University of Upsala
His specialty.
THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.
In the year 1783, a mystic by the name of Caligari toured the fairs of numerous villages in northern Italy, accompanied by a somnambulist named Cesare.
A puppet, the exact likeness of Cesare, and which took his place in a cabinet, allowed him to divert any suspicion that might fall on the somnambulist.
My diary.

It's the director who's insane!
He is Caligari... Caligari... Caligari!
At last I understand his delusion.
He thinks I am that mystic, Caligari...!
Now I know exactly how to cure him...

In the first part of The Spiders, millionaire adventurer Kay Hoog... thwarts the plan of the criminal Spiders organization... to steal the treasure of a lost Inca civilization...
Returning to America with Naela, a beautiful Priestess of the Incas...
He rejected the romantic advances of Lio Sha, one of the Spider's leaders... and proclaims his love for Naela.
Returning home from a false mission... he finds the dead body of Naela, murdered by the Spiders...
Kay Hoog swears that Lio Sha will pay dearly for her jealous act.
The house of steel.
"Our organization works like a machine...
It's not our fault that we still have not found the stone.
The Diamond Ship..."
"Again the lost stone is not there.
I will tell our clients about it this evening."
"And Kay Hoog?"
"Kay Hoog will not cross our path again He has already learned the power of the Spiders."
"I have finally arranged a raid on the suspected house."
"But why are you concerned with this whole affair?"
"I have an old score to settle."
"The raid is set for exactly 11 o'clock."
"I'll be there with you."
A modern raid.
"3 1/2 Carats... $70,000 going once... going twice..."
The secret of the many diamond thefts.
An old bookworm.
"This is new proof of my suspicions.
Under the Chinese quarter exists a secret Chinese city.
This piece of ivory is the entrance key."
"Search for this sign in the shops of the Chinese quarter there you will find the way to the subterranean city."
"But beware.
The Police will give you no protection in the Chinese quarter let alone in the subterranean city.
Remember - they deny it even exists!"
In the subterranean Chinese city.
"I must talk with the Captain of the Storm Bird as soom as possible Our search here for the Buddha-head diamond was in vain."
In one of the Chinese shops above the subterranean city.
"The Guards of Chinatown."
The gambling rooms of the Red Dragon.
"The Buddha-head diamond is not in the city otherwise we would have found it."
"The diamonds were of no value ti us.
Part of the proceeds from their sale was deposited in a joint account, and part..."
"I'll stay another two days until the initial excitement in over Then in the evening I was board the Storm Bird and we can sail immediately."
"Kay Hoog is here."
"Release the woman and you are free to go."
But they were not to be trusted As soon as Kay Hoog released her, he was overpowered and imprisoned.
"Will you make a deal?"
"How much?
Attorney Baker has little respect for the law.
"I heard that the Storm Bird is sailing for South America.
Is that true?"
"I have a case of secret documents that must be delivered to a foreign power outside of the United States.
The authorities must not learn of it."
"My client will pay $10,000 now and $20,000 upon delivery of the unopened case."
That evening.
An episode in India.
"The Diamond Ship has not fulfilled its mission The Buddha-head diamond has not been found."
"The Master will make a new attempt today to find the stone.
Yoghi All-hab-mah India's most famous clairvoyant will help in this holy cause."
A hypnotic-telepathic experiment.
"Find the Buddha stone, so that Asia can become great and free itself from foreign rule."
Experiment successful.
Dear Mr. Hoog:
This stone was stolen and, so the story goes, Asia will free itself from foreign tyranny when a Princess brings this stone back to Asia.
"Change course...
head for England!"
John Terry, the diamond magnate, and his daughter Ellen.

"The Storm Bird left the harbor tonight for an unknown destination."
On board of Storm Bird.
"I don't know what diamond you're talking about."
"It seems that the solution can only be found through John Terry himself."
"I don't know what they want from me.
I have never owned such a stone."
"And yet the secret must lie with you.
The Spiders do nothing that isn't thought out.
Isn't anything known in your family about such a diamond?"
"Perhaps one of your ancestors?"
"That's the founder of our family fortune one of the most famous pirate captains of the sixteenth century."
"The logbook of the Sea Witch."
"I vaguely remember reading something in the Captain's logbook that might have been a reference to the diamond shaped like a Buddha."
We went ashore on the coast of the Falkland Islands and found our secret cache in the caves, as we had left it two years ago.
"A few pages in the logbook are missing here.
What happened after distributing the loot I don't know.
Something terrible must have happened, because the logbook says only..."
I was the only one who could save himself.
"What happened... what catastrophe befell the unlucky sailors there is nothing in the logbook.
Shortly thereafter, the Captain died in a battle, and his successor brought the logbook and the picture to the family."
Many have tried to discover the secret of the hiding place but no one has succeeded.
"An old map of the Falkland Islands."
"Four-Finger John!"
"Let's see if we can find any clues in his room to the whereabouts of Ellen."
"If you tell us exactly what has happened to Ellen Terry, we will release you and give you the reward.
"Ellen Terry was taken on board the Storm Bird and is sailed immediately.
I don't know its destination."
"We will keep you here for 48 hours, to prevent sabotage of our plans Then you are free."
"I will try to find the stone...
the fate of your daughter depends on it I will succeed or perish."
"Stone possibly on Falkland Islands Kay Hoog on his way to find the diamond."
"Change the course of the Storm Bird at once!"
"I will force Ellen Terry under my will and make her the Princess who will free Asia from all foreign tyranny."
"When she wears the Imperial Crown, all Asia will lie at our feet."
"A footprint!"
The treasure cavern.
"Give me the Buddha-head diamond!"
"He has to have the stone.
I saw it in his hand."
"Hunger and thirst will make you talk."
The poisonous crater.
During the night, deadly fumes rose from the crater.
Weeks later, back in London.
"I was the only one who could save himself, and here is the stone."
"Shortly before you arrived, I received a call from the Pinkerton Detective Agency. They think they have found a clue to my daughter.
"An elderly gentlemen has registered at the Royal Hotel with a young woman Although she is supposedly his daughter, she fits the photo of the missing girl."
"I have been instructed to ask you to come along and identify the girl."
"We must be careful not to arouse suspicion You can observe their room from here."
"Lio Sha is dead."
"The stone is lost forever."
"No one must know.
"There is only one way to avoid disaster.
Have a diamond shop cut a stone that is just like the original.
That's the only way to fool them."
"Go to Amsterdam today.
Spare no expense.
It's our only chance."
"Ellen Terry is under my spell.
She is sleeping now."
"You have betrayed Asia You and the woman who was going to usurp the Imperial Crown...
"Your daughter appears to have been under a hypnotic spell But she's awake now, and knows nothing of the past events."

"Dangers of the fly" was rendered from a 35 mm copy, very well preserved by the "Pablo Ducrós Hicken" Film Museum.
During the process, a likely correct speed for projection was estimated.
DANGERS OF THE FLY
The aim of this film is to disseminate to the audience a knowledge that generally remains restricted to researchers.
The magnification diameters given in this film refer to the size of the image as projected on an 8 meters screen.
The fly, dipterous, grows in filth, lives among men and is the carrier of many diseases.
These insects have been and continue to be the object of countless scientific studies carried out by zoologists, entomologists and hygienists.
These dipterous are studied in medical zoology and parasitology research laboratories from a systematic point of view
(placing these insects in the zoological system ).
For a systematic study, zoologists begin by differentiating species within the same class
(In this case Brachycera ).
Their biology ( characteristics and habits), and their role as carrier and transmitter of pathogenic germs.
Fly legs are made of hair, claws, bristles, spines and flakes that work as an outstanding conveyor of germs, microorganisms and diseases.
By observing the wing veins, different types of Brachycera can be classified:
MUSCIDAE, TABANIDAE, CESTRIADE, ASILIDAE, etc.
(Enlargement: 3850 diametres)
In order to be studied, and without losing hair, flakes, bristles and other features that allow them to be identified, they are kepts in special jars.
They are put to death using Xylol, Chloroform, Benzine and Ether gasses, etc.
Afterwards, they are fastened with silver, gold or other stainless metals pins and are kept in special packing jars.

contains millions of moving bacteria, the cause of several diseases.
(Enlargement: 35.000 diameters)
Located in the dipterous excrements, these germs can affect people and cause diseases.
The events observed in the laboratory are identical to those that take place in nature.
Through these habits, flies transmit:
TYPHOID FEVER, DYSENTERY,
CHOLERA, AND OTHER SEVERE INFECTIONS.
(The proboscis is covered with hair, which is an excellent microorganism transmitter)
The death rate caused by intestinal diseases among the infantile population (0 to 3 years) reached 8500. This indicates how dangerous they are.
The following process has been described as the major cause of

Different protozoan like Balantidiun coli and Entamoeba dysenteriae cause acute dysentery.

PANGONIA SP.?
Some of these species transmit trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping disease or "mal de caderas".
When men or animals are stung by this type of fly, they develop a deadly disease in a period of 9 to 10 days.
Trypanosoma equinum... This is the parasite that causes mal de caderas disease...
Tripanosoma equinum: a genus of parasitic flagellate protozoa of the family Trypanosomatidae.
Enlargement: 350.000 diameters
MUSCA DOMESTICA, STOMOXIS CALCITRANS and other species develop in excrement.
They lay eggs in excrement, rotten meat and other organic decomposed substances, where larvae can feed on.
Laying eggs takes them approximately 30 minutes.
This egg laying insect uses its touch sensibility to find a hidden, appropriate place to lay its eggs...
Enlargement: 2000 diameters
... a group of 280 to 300 eggs are laid at the same time.
If these eggs were placed one next to the other, they would cover a 712 square millimeters surface.
Using a microscope, one can see that the eggs show a longitudinal line, where they hatch.
Depending on the temperature conditions, hatching occurs 12 to 24 hours after the eggs are laid.
Enlargement: 3150 diameters
This process occurs in less than a minute. ... the new born larvae leave the egg shells.
The larvae turn into 8 to 10 millimeter long, opaque white worms.
When the pupa is totally still, its outer shell gets thick and hard. Its color turns from white to brown. This process takes approximately 6 hours.

if this amount lays eggs during this period 22.934.144.295.301 flies.
If you kill a fly, you are killing 22 TRILLION dangerous insects.
There are countless procedures to exterminate flies.
Demonstration:
Every means at our disposal to exterminate flies are useful.
Insecticide is as deadly to flies as machine guns are to men.
A mix of: Milk 100 grams, Sugar 1 tablespoon, Formol 1 tablespoon This is an effective fly-killing candy.
Fly paper and different traps.
All of these devices are highly effective.

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE
A tale told in moving pictures under the direction of VICTOR SJÖSTRÖM
At the camera - J. JULIUS
Once there was a poor Salvation Army sister at death's door.
She'd been stricken with galloping consumption and had only held out for the space of a year.
When there was no hope left, she'd gone home to her mother.
Waiting at the foot of her bed was another Salvation Army sister who had worked alongside the sick girl.
Don't fret over those poor souls now, Sister Edit.
You've done enough for them.
Send for David Holm!"
Please don't!
My daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life.
Now that she's dying, let me have her to myself.
Sister Maria, why don't you do as I ask?
Send for David Holm!
I shall go find him at once. "
You can't be serious! Asking David Holm to attend to a dying person!
I wasn't able to find him, but Gustavsson is looking too.
He'll bring him here if it's at all possible.
Poor Mrs. Holm!"
03 p
It wouldn't do for her husband to see her if he should come here.
The evening on which these events took place was no ordinary evening.
It was New Year's Eve.
Well, we'll certainly know when it's time to toast the New Year. "
It's a spooky place to wait for midnight, here among the dead. "
You gentlemen aren't afraid of ghosts, I hope'?"
Then I'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour. "
"I once had a pal named Georges, who was generally a jolly fellow.
He came from a good family and had studied at Uppsala University, so he knew a bit more than the rest of us.
But a change would come over him on New Year's Eve. "
Remember that it's New Year's Eve, the last day of the year!"
Whoever dies on this eve must drive Death's carriage. "
There is an old, old carriage... "
It is no ordinary driver who holds the reins, for he's in the service of a strict master named Death.
For him, a single night is as long as 100 years on Earth.
Night and day he must Carry out his master's business.
END OF PART 1
THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 2
Wherever he goes, he's greeted with sorrow and despair. "
There is no escape. He must perform his forlorn duty. "
Though horse and carriage are always the same, the driver is not. "
Now you know why I'm afraid of something fatal happening to me on New Year's Eve.
And the odd thing is, you see, that Georges apparently died last New Year's Eve.
Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived with David Holm?"
Come with me, David Holm!
Sister Edit is dying, and she has asked for you.
If Sister Edit wants to see you, you must go to her at once!"
David, I can't believe it's you!
It is you who is to relieve me!"
You should take me to the hospital in your carriage as quickly as you can. "
No living soul rides in that carriage.
By the time I arrive, it's too late for a doctor.
You know full well that I am no longer among the living. "
But worst of all, you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime.
David, do you think I'm unaware that it's my fault you've met such an end'?
If you hadn't fallen in with me, you'd have led a good life with your wife, children, and brother.
By tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behavior.
But before you leave, a harsher punishment awaits you.
Behold your brother.
While you were here, he killed a man while intoxicated, and now a long prison term awaits.
But we feel that you ought to serve the sentence in his place, since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer.
Does this not make you want to turn from your wicked ways, David Holm?"
Yes!
Only now do I realize how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one.
What about your wife and children?"
Now I know how miserable they've been, but I will turn over a new leaf.
They need never despair of me again.
END OF PART 2
THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 3
No, she's not ill.
She was well enough the other day when she left.
And here I thought I'd come home to her with such joy!"
If she had gone openly, I would have understood.
But to slink off like that, to let me come home to an empty house - that was heartless!
I'll wipe those smiles off your faces.
I'll find her and show her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core, like mine has now!
I'll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife, during which your feelings of hatred and revenge grew ever stronger.
I will take you to a time a year ago, to last New Year's Eve, when you came to this town, bringing such misfortune in your wake.
A Salvation Army station had been set up here in town, and it was ready for use on New Year's Eve.
Keep your food! I just want to sleep. "
Leave it alone!
It may be full of germs, and our sterilizing oven isn't working yet.
Don't you realize, Maria, how happy I am to help the first guest God has sent us?
Please go to bed.
It's been a busy day.
Let me attend to this.
Dear Jesus, let our first guest be blessed with a happy year. "
All night long she bent over the coat, never giving a thought to the germs and filth she inhaled.
By the time she went to bed, the icy chill of winter had thoroughly filled the room.
Was it you who mended my coat'?"
Would you mind calling the person who did this?"
It's a shame you went to all that trouble, miss, but I'm used to having it like this.
Before you leave, I'd like to ask you to visit me again next New Year's Eve. "
You see, I prayed that our first guest would have a good year, and I'd like to know if my prayer was answered.
Oh, I'll be here.
I'll come show you God didn't give a fig for you or your twaddle.
The time has come to honor that promise before you take over here.
From you she contracted the disease that put her on her deathbed, and now she awaits your visit.
You possessed all that is most wonderful, but you lost it!
You cannot avoid the torment of remorse, just as you cannot escape taking over as Death's driver for a year.
"Captive, come forth from thy prison!
Ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight, thou wilt relieve me of my office.
For a year thou wilt set souls free from the earthly realm.
END OF PART 3
THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 4
It is Death, but he has come too soon. "
You see that I'm not afraid of you.
I will gladly heed your summons, but grant me a day's reprieve, for there is someone I must talk sense into.
You do not know what terrible misfortune I have caused.
I cannot approach the Lord until I have set it right.
The person I'm waiting for is the man I love.
Do you understand?
The man I love!
I would grant you that reprieve if it would avail you. But you have no power over this man!
Believing he was good, you've tried to make him mend his ways, but your hopes have been dashed time and time again.
It was you who enticed him away from his home and work!
You made him the drunkard he is!
Don't let yourself be dragged under!"
SALVATION ARMY RALLY
Run along and be saved, and I'll be sure to come watch!"
Why turn away so carefully?
I'm a consumptive myself, but I cough in people's faces in hopes of finishing them off.
Why should they be better off than us?
He's merely amusing himself.
He's not as wicked as he pretends to be. "
How can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man'?"
You needn't worry about that.
I'll be leaving town in a few days. "
No, you mustn't do that!"
I would rather you stayed so I may challenge you again. "
Tempting as that may be, I still can't stay. "
You see, little missy, I'm on a journey throughout Sweden in search of someone I must find at all costs.
Who is this person you seek?"
You'll know that when I find the person in question!"
I am the one David Holm is looking for. "
I am his wife. "
I couldn't endure the life he was leading.
I deserted him. I took my children and crept away in secret.
I moved to this town, for it was so far from our old home that I never expected him to come looking for me here.
You must take him back!
it's his only hope!"
"I didn't mean you must make up your mind on the spot. Only promise you'll listen to your heart, and let us talk again later.
She had gotten the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world.
Just come with me!
A surprise awaits that will make you happy.
END OF PART 4
THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 5
She hoped to replant in good soil the seed that had fallen among thorns. And she may well have succeeded had it not been for...
The doctor says it's pneumonia.
And her resistance is poor, for she's been in ill health since last New Year's Eve.
Yes, that David Holm has been her undoing.
She worries so about the situation between him and his wife, but she mustn't know the truth.
You might at least have the heart to refrain from infecting the children!"
It wasn't so easy to run away this time!"
Haven't you had your fill of revenge, David'?"
If only I hadn't brought them together again.
His sin would be of lesser magnitude were it not for me.
You must grant me a reprieve!
I cannot die yet!
I must see him turn over a new leaf!
Just spare me a few minutes!
You know I love him!
I've never loved him as I do today. "
Captive, ye of loving head, come forth from thy prison!"
Come along.
We have no business here.
Those who are to receive her will arrive shortly.
You know, David, if I could send a message to mankind,
I would like to send them a New Year's greeting.
"I would like them to dwell on a single New Year's prayer:
'Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped. '
Why are we here?
Surely no one here is going to die!"
No, I can't go on!
I can't go on!"
I'm sorry, but I must go away, and I cannot leave them behind. "
Please don't be angry with me.
it's not my fault. "
This will do, David.
It will suffice for the children and myself.
"Yes, David, I see what's coming.
I'm obliged to watch.
I will not shirk my duty.
You mustn't let this happen!
This mustn't come to pass!
Don't let those poor, innocent creatures die!
"I have no power over the living.
Where should I turn?
Should I pray to God or to Christ?
Who can tell me where to direct my plea'?
I'm a poor, miserable sinner, and I beseech the Lord of life and death!
I'm not worthy. I've broken your every commandment.
Condemn me to eternal darkness!
Let nothing remain of me!
Do what you will to me, my Lord, but spare the three of them!
"David, I see that I no longer need grieve for you!
"Captive, return to thy prison!
She didn't do it yet!
I made it in time!"
Sister Edit is dead. I was at her side.
I promised her I'd become a good husband and father.
You're lying!
Sister Maria told me you refused to go to her!
Are you owing, David'?"
No one believes I want to reform.
I want to be good, but no one believes me.
Is it any wonder I cry'?
It's hard to believe, David.
But I do believe you.
Your tears have convinced me.
I can't help crying too.
I won't be truly happy until all my sorrow is drained.
Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped. "

God bless you... shepherd!
God bless you...
Welcome and have a rest.
Dear me, what a man you are, square-built like Jánošík.
What, shepherd?
Begad, like Jánošík who used to live here.
Jurko Jánošík did not know what was going on at home when he was coming back to see his old parents after two years of studies and distress.
Little bread, much work!
God bless you...
I am exhausted after the long journey.
Could I have some water?
Enjoy it. To your health!
Oh, this is our neighbour Anka. Yes, Anka!
Pišta.
It happened two years ago.
Easy, easy. The kiss is hot you could burn your moustache.
Do not leave yet!
Through the scarf only!
Well-known cottages.
Jánošík's friend and protector.
I have not seen my father and mother yet.
Are they healthy?
Dear father!
Where is mom?
Mom, my dear mom!
The old Jánošík was not at work again!
My wife died.
She would not have jumped out of the coffin even if you came to work.
Fifty strokes with a stick!
Go and tell Jánošík they are beating his father.
How can you? You, you!
It is good the monk is here, we can save on the funeral.
And he was beaten so badly that he died on the same day.
At the village.
To work!
Think it over and you will never have to work for your lords.
They chase him, so Jánošík hides in a cave.
Oh, mother, mother dear, A long way from here. I cry longing for you Want to be near.
Bless you.
Thank you, Anka.
No!
Do not leave!
I thought there was nobody to look after my parents' graves. But you...
Annie, you are an angel!
No, Annie, I shall not become a priest.
The bloody nobs make it impossible.
You cannot run away this time!
We shall catch him and earn a hundred ducats as a reward.
An uninvited witness.
Well, you can fight pretty well, father.
I am not a priest yet and probably shall never be one.
This dog and Šándor took me everything and chased me like an animal.
Is it you, Jánošík from Terchová?
Is it really you?
I am Hrajnoha, the bandits' captain.
We nearly forgot about that one.
Pay a fine.
Hey, there's a grove up the way. There's a path up the way. My father was a good fellow.
Fellows! Here - Jánošík - our new companion - let him be our captain!
Long live Jánošík!
Long live our new captain!
Dear friends!
I should have been a priest but Satan crossed my plans.
Do you want me to be your captain?
Well then, I accept.
I promise to be your fair leader!
As so far, we shall go on protecting the serfs.
We will help them in all possible ways.
Our will - our strength.
Let the serfs benefit from all our doings!
The lords take us everything - our properties, freedom, lives - we shall not spare them! But remember, we shall not kill anybody!
Death shall not change anybody.
Long live our captain!
The walls in the Count Šándor's mansion were the silent witnesses of the gentry's wild life.
Not every squire is a good squire. The Hungarian squire is the best!
In the neighbouring domain. Visitors are coming.
His nobility - Baron Révay.
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
Well, Your Nobility, will you pay your debt at last?
Of course I will!
Yes, I was just checking how much I got.
How many times shall I mention my 5.OOO guldens?
I will put you up for public auction!
Is it still the old wine?
Lo! What wine?
Well, will you sell me a bushel?
To sell?
It will be a present from me, sir!
Oh no, it would be much waste, I shall buy it.
Believe me, sir, upon my squire word, if the crop was in the barns I would pay you immediately. But where to get money now?
And what about the peasants? Could they not pay your debt?
What do you mean?
Well, it is simple.
Each peasant will pay 5O pennies.
Those who do not have the money will pay in produce.
The Jew will buy them and you will get money!
Well, sir, tell my servant not to get the horses until tomorrow.
Those who refuse will be beaten and put in the stocks!
Give me back my pots!
I have nothing to pay the tax with. I could not pay you for your work.
Well, I shall mend them gratis.
After a short while.
Really cheap.
Did he pay?
I am coming to collect the tax in the afternoon.
It was very good advice, indeed.
We are even now.
You can use my advice also next time.
Fellows, I must go down to the village.
And you, Hrajnoha, Take care of Baron Révay!
The serf cannot rest even on Sunday.
When will a squire keep his word?
The daughter is alone, isn't she?
You will not work hard in this cabin any more, you will come with me to my manor-house.
You must be sensible, you will be well in the manor-house.
Oh, you are like a scared little animal. Do not be so stubborn.
You will soon forget about that bandit!
Here he is, the bandit!
Well, so this is the bandit nest, isn't it? But you shall not escape this time!
You coward!
Well, you will pay for those words!
At the father's protection.
Father, help me. Rescue Annie from Šándor!
Dear son, what path did you take?
Oh, Father, do not condemn me. You know the soul of the suffering serfs.
Oh, mercy!
Be a father to my Anka!
Jánošík took care of the poor serfs, helped them together with the local priest and other secret friends.
Evening at the parish house.
What Šándor's people took, cannot be given back.
Here, Jánošík is sending you some ducats for the damage.
Meeting at the county administrator's place.
Is the Hungarian squire not the master and lord of his peasants any more?
Should we let these dirty bandits order us what to do and want not to do?
Well, do you know what happened at the last county ball?
Before midnight... When everybody was having a good time...
You rob from the serfs, I rob from you.
And each of your sins will be punished.
You let my father be beaten to death!
You took everything from me!
Remember, you shall not escape my revenge!
And we should take this?
This is not a good order!
Gentlemen, I promise you to clear your county of this group of bandits.
Here, Commissioner will give you soldiers.
The trap is ready.
Is his lover hiding at the parish?
Where has the bandit's lover gone?
And you, foolish old man, give the bandits' money to peasants?
Your master will throw you out of the parish.
I have resigned myself to anything.
Well, old man, is there some wine for your guest?
Hey, old woman! Has some bandit fallen in love with you yet?
What brought you here? What can I do for you?
I came to confess.
But this time you will confess to me!
Does the bandit come here often?
Why do you not bring the girl here?
So she can tell me where the bandit is.
You know where he is, too.
Tell me, you old fool!
Don't you know it?
You! ?
Jánošík!
For goodness sake, save yourself! Soldiers!
Go away! Away!
Come on, Mišo! Come on!
Let the house shake!
While at the farm...
Look out, fellows!
Prepare your pistols, get ready and follow me!
No, Jánošík! We must not lose you!
I am the first to go.
In the name of His Majesty, surrender, Jánošík!
Eternal peace.
The verdict. As the accused and his, already punished, companions, are found guilty, having been accused of many felonies: Arson, robbery and even murder, he is sentenced to death!
Such was the death of Jánošík, the first fighter for freedom of the Slovak people.
Thank you, shepherd.
Take care!
Part II:
Hell.
A drama of people of our time.
Prelude
Carozza has been arrested.
Through the power of his will,
Countess Told, whom he loves.
Dear Mr. von Wenk:
I thought that I would find the paid tout of a notorious criminal -- only to find a woman full of love, before whose simple and unconditional feelings...
I am not suitable to be your ally
Please forgive me if for that reason I have to disappoint you
The sleeping woman -- --
I am not suitable to be your ally
Yours, Dusy Told, Countess
Only now shall the world learn who I am!
I! Mabuse! A giant -- a titan who jumbles up laws and gods ... like withered leaves!
Count Told, would you not like to confide what happened to you?
I have cheated in the game ...
I cheated at cards!
I cheated--! Yes--!
I who usually never touch a card - - I had such a streak of luck!
frankly, it scared me.
Were all your guests old acquaintances?
All, except one ... whom my wife had invited the psychoanalyst Dr. Mabuse.
But he did not join in the game.
My wife has left me ... Surely she has gone home to her mother ... because she does not want to share her life with a card-cheat --.
Don't you trust any doctor at all?
Some experienced psychiatrist in whom you could confide?
Dr. Mabuse...?
If I'd turn to Dr. Mabuse?
Useless, Countess.
Count Told is on the phone!
Doctor, you were present ... when I had that-- accident at the card table...
I need your medical help.
I treat patients only in their homes!
End of Act I
Ready!
They will move her to the women's prison.
The eleventh hour -
Your case interests me -
- I will treat you.
For as long as you are under my treatment you will not leave the house, not receive anybody, not speak to anybody.
You must not see anyone who reminds you of your former life!
As from today I am not available to anyone, neither personally nor by telephone
Tell everybody asking for me or the Countess that we have gone away for an indefinite time!"
Please connect me to Count Told.
The Countess is not staying with her mother!
I am sorry, but sir and madam are away!
I am sorry, Mr. State Attorney, but sir and madam left this morning!
The blind -- --
If by some damned coincidence they got on my track
I'll get away through this tunnel.
From underneath a gentle push will lift the door!
Put on something decent and report to me
Captivity ...
Be careful!
My sudden disappearance will not go unnoticed.
Your friends?
Unless the State Attorney really hurries up, he won't have much more time to free you!"
And your husband ... ?
Your husband is under my medical treatment,
You'd better not speak of your husband!
Do not dare even to think of him! You will be pronouncing his death sentence if you mention his name in my presence!"
Good God, hurry up!
For a while I'd be ... in a jail ... for women!
Your situation is only your fault, Miss Carozza.
Why are you so obstinate, Miss Carozza? If you'd assist us in clearing up Hull's murder,
You are sacrificing yourself for a scoundrel who has simply abandoned you -- and in vain -- for we are already on his tail!
He is stronger than all of you!
He destroys anybody he wants too!
I am supposed to check the electrical wiring in here...
The man for whose sake you are here has thrown you away like a squeezed fruit.
... like a squeezed fruit strip.
Give me two days time ...
I have to go get a ladder ...
When will Wenk be back?
Wenk has managed to wear down La Carozza.
Then we must liquidate!
That will cost you your life, my boy!
But ... Why?
I have not done anything to him!
I'll try an experiment ...
I will confront him with La Carozza. Perhaps one of them will give themselves away -- or both ... ...
End of Act II
Act III
He has killed her --!
Who?
Who?
No, no, no ... I will not say anything ... or the same thing will happen to me!
Take this man to police headquarters under double guard and with every conceivable precaution!
You should go down a road different from usual !
And if I have to cross-examine you for 48 hours...
I will get the name out of you! You may count on that!"
They arrested Johannes Gutter!
They're taking him to police headquarters!
All his life Johannes Gutter has devoted himself to our just cause!
That's why he has been taken from our midst now!
Are we going to put up with that? !
We will not let him down!
We will free him!
They are not taking the usual route!
They are going through Mueller Street!
Johannes Gutter!
Release Johannes Gutter!
Be sensible, folks!
The prisoner we're transporting. is not Johannes Gutter at all!
See for yourselves that the prisoner is not Gutter.
But then be sensible and clear the path!"
Where have the people with the prisoner got to?
After the incident with La Carozza, I will not have a minute of peace ... I won't rest until I know that fellow to be in your special care!
Carozza was thoroughly searched when she was brought in.
How did she suddenly get the poison?
Even in the women's prison, the Great Unknown must have his accomplices!
In Mueller Street we suddenly could not get any further!
God knows who incited those people--!
Wake up to the Countess ... and tell her that I wish to speak to her.
I've never seen that person before.
None of us knew him!
But since he shot his mouth off -- --
You wished to speak to me?
The game between us must end -- one way -- or the other!
I am no longer the man I used to be.
I make mistakes ...
losing my nerve ...
I intend to leave this city, this country, Countess and I have come to ask if you want to join me.
I want you to be mine!
For the last time, Countess, will you follow me of your free will -- or as a prisoner?
Never! Do you hear me? ...
I want to return to my husband!
You have now pronounced pronounced his death sentence--
Nocturnal phantoms --
The day ...
Dr. Mabuse!
Your condition has deteriorated
-- you are sicker than ever!
Do you know that your wife wants to commit you to an insane asylum?
Your wife has left you --
Forever!
Your life is ruined -- you cannot go on living -- -
- - Not go on living -- !
The Count must be left absolutely alone - any disturbance could be fatal!"
Not go on living!
With the razor -- --!
End Act III
Act IV
Where is the Countess?
I have not seen her ... since that terrible night at the card game!
hen why did you tell me on the telephone that the Master and Mistress had gone away?
I was ordered to do so by the Count.
In my humble opinion, Sir, the master grew really bad only after
Dr. Mabuse treated him.
Since we are going abroad tomorrow, Countess here are the people who will have the honor to be at your service!
I want to return to my husband!
Your husband is dead ... !
If there is any human feeling in you --
If there is any human feeling in you --
Let me go to my husband!
I'm going to personally visit Dr. Mabuse.
Do you know the address?
Dr. Mabuse, Psychoanalysis
I am very sorry, the doctor is out!
No news, Mr. Prosecutor.
With your permission:
Dr. Mabuse!
What a strange coincidence, Doctor! I have just come from your house.
Now come from home.
I wanted to inform you of the suicide of your patients, Count Told!
And I, State Attorney von Wenk, came to ask your help in preventing just such a tragedy!
Are you familiar with Weltmann's experiments?
Today! Today! An Evening of Experiments Sandor Weltmann
Hypnosis, Trance, Natural Magnetism, The Secrets.
of the Indian Fakirs. The Secrets of the Psyche.
The Subconscious in Man and Animal.
In the Main Auditorium of Philharmonic Hall At 8 o'clock
--preferably, people who try to resist his influence--
And you believe Count Told fell victim to such an overpowering influence of some unknown enemy?
You have roused my curiosity, Doctor I will follow your suggestion!
Forgive me just one more question, Doctor:
do you happen to know the whereabouts of Countess Told?
How come you let that gentleman into my office without informing me?
Are not even you to be relied on any more?
As soon as you see Wenk approaching, start the engine and let him pass.
Then you come back here as quickly as possible!
This time his whole bodyguard won't save the State Attorney!
I don't know if Sandor Weltmann himself is the puppeteer.
In any case, we are dealing with an opponent where the improbable is the most likely of all things expected.
That means you'll just have to act on your own initiative--
End of Act IV Act V
Today!
Today! An Evening of Experiments Sandor Weltmann,
Hypnosis, Trance, Natural Magnetism, The Secrets. of the Indian Fakirs. The Secrets of the Psyche.
The Subconscious in Man and Animal.
In the Main Auditorium of Philharmonic Hall 8 o'clock
I would next like to demonstrate to you a case of typical mass suggestion such as is the power base of the Hindu Fakirs.
Would somebody please call out a couple of two-digit numbers!
If the ladies and gentlemen occupying the seats with those numbers are agreeable to my conducting some experiments with them, would they please rise.
Seat number 12 is empty!
Perhaps the gentleman at number 11 would be so kind--
In the right inside pocket of your jacket you have two 1000 - Mark notes issued in 1918, Series D and Series No. 65045 No.
F 5567 , a weapon license, one identity card; in your left inside pocket you carry a Browning -- is that correct?
Would you please read out what it says on the note?
The lady from number 64 shall remove the Browning from the inside pocket of the Gentleman at number 11 and give it to the Gentleman at number 5!
Would the Gentleman at number 11 be so kind as to be available for one more experiment?"
Then I would ask you, as well as a few other ladies and gentleman,
to come up and join me on the stage!"
A new experiment! This Gentleman will be so kind and carry out what I have written down in this sealed envelope
-Nan -Fu
Tsi-Nan-Fu
Dr. Ma ..
Do what I have written down!
The note says:
You lead the lady to her seat, leave the auditorium, go home and go to bed!
This thing gives me an eerie feeling!
Boss, the "Great Unknown" we are looking for
Dr. Mabuse, doctor, gambler, criminal--!
To the closest police station!
And as fast as possible!
Finale
I'll look after the car, you wake Fine and the Countess!
Let the Doctor sleep as long as possible. After last night's business, He was completely exhausted.
We can't get out, the police have surrounded the house!
Then -- we'll give them a fight!
End of Act V
Act VI
They are resisting more stubbornly than we anticipated.
The men should keep under cover ... until I give further instructions!
A telephone conversation --
This is State Attorney von Wenk speaking!
Doctor Mabuse, I request you not to resist the forces of justice.
I don't know anything about your 'justice'.
If you want me -- get me!"
We are determined to proceed against you with the fiercest means!
Give up your pointless resistance!
I allow myself to draw your attention to the fact that Countess Told is also in the house!
We must get the army to help us!
Dr. Mabuse has a prisoner ... Told ... the countess.
We have to storm the house quickly, otherwise the lady's life will be in danger!
The army is coming--!
And you snort coke, you chicken!
Let the woman go, Doctor!
Save yourself!
Where is Mabuse?
Shut up, Spoerri!
Remember Pesch!
--Home--!
Caught--!
Will he keep his mouth shut, this weed? !
These objects were found on the dead in Mabuse's house, Sir!
And Hawasch is dead ... and Fine ...
It's the key ... ... to Hawasch's counterfeiting plant he may have taken refuge there --!
Take over the bank, Dr. Mabuse..."
The man who was once Mabuse--
Enough!
I will hear no more!
It's disgusting, appalling!
But yet... I who thought it up, hatched it out in nights, in nights... ah!
You do not know!
For you it's a game spicing what else life offers you willingly.
But to me! A thirsty one!
One who is at the point of pining away... mocked, harassed, abused by tortures which...
That nature gave me, together with this face and this hump, such feelings, such greed... I beg you, quiet!
The devil! The guardians of order are on watch and full of ambition.
Behind the doors the bribed servants are lurking,
- in the gardens henchmen are hiding.
- You exaggerate, my friend.
Scruples too profound are really out of place.
What was the watchword you gave us some weeks ago?
""Beauty be prey of the strong.""
""All splendour of the world succumb to the power of mind,""
""and the conqueror's glory shine brighter""
""and penetrate deeper, more painfully into the souls""
""than the brilliance which merely dazzles the eye.""
- lt's true!
- Thus you spoke.
- And since then...
- What you created you shun.
You even avoid us!
None of the clandestine festivities has welcomed you!
Just because a few fathers wring their hands and a few mothers cry heart-rendingly!
Just don't think the beauties themselves are angry with us.
Yesterday Alissa, the little Jewess, you should have seen her face!
And the amazing daughter of Biparetto the poet, really, she was lovely!
We snatch them from their lovers' arms heavy with everyday burdens!
The misunderstood woman weeps not for the husband inexperienced in love!
Out of cramped rooms into wide, mystic spaces...
All fairy tales come to life, all dreams of secret nights...
Dreams of the Orient, they come true!
What no one admits and everyone longs for suddenly is reality!
Quite so, quite so... lt is convincing.
But in one point, pardon me, for me it's not quite right.
You always only speak about yourself who are good-looking and endowed with charm, and you forget me, the cripple.
If he came to the festivities, as you demand, he would spoil them... and instead of lust horror would pave its way.
My friend, it seems to me that you overrate enormously the way women feel about beauty.
There were spring nights.
Through open windows it came in, dancing.
All sensuous magic, scent of flowers, heavy and inebriating.
And I had to leave, tossed by a fever, out into lonely lanes.
And I searched for a strumpet, a really depraved one.
Spoke to her, offered her gold, a lot of gold, still I felt like the beggar asking for alms.
By the light of the street lamp she looked me up and down with eyes... a smile...
so humiliating that my blood ran cold.
There the gold had an effect!
On coloured lips its blaze reflected my misery's dreadful need.
Lascivious words promised agreement, but I didn't have the strength to spit at myself and to desecrate the spring night.
My lord, the notary.
- For goodness, Alviano...
- You're capable of...
What's the notary supposed to do?
Don't worry!
Would you ask him to be patient for a short time.
I forgot to confide it to you.
My island Elysium, with all its buildings, fountains and resplendent gardens, with all its miracles of art unheard of and rare treasures of generous nature,
as a donation I left it for perpetuity to the city.
You're out of your senses!
Your life's work!
You spent half your fortune on it; you wasted it, thoughtlessly.
Tomorrow evening, after dusk, in the presence of the Senate and the PodestÁ, I'll officially announce it
to the people.
Gentlemen, you are invited.
But, for goodness, do you forget... I considered everything.
You hand us over!
The access to the underground hall... lf you fear discovery, avoid it from now on.
But excuse me now.
I await the town councillors and, together with the notary, I must lay down the wording and articles of the donation.
Vitelozzo!
- l am late.
- We see! - And out of breath!
My friends...
I am bewildered!
Sancta Maria, what happened?
- Deeply moved...
- Oh, God!
Unhappy one!
...by such beauty!
- l thought so!
- A goddess.
- A flower.
- We know this.
- Please, be quiet!
Where did you see this beauty?
I came past the town hall when the city elders drove up in their coaches for some festivity.
Maybe there is... what do you think... ln one of them, listen...
My greetings, gentlemen, and thanks that my modest home has been honoured by such distinguished guests.
Your modest home?
O noble Sir Salvago, you are too unassuming.
The splendour of the rooms we walked through is unequalled in all of Genoa.
Your compliment makes me happy.
But please permit:
here are my friends, the best of Genoa's aristocracy.
You will recognize the names of illustrious descents.
This is my only child, my beloved daughter Carlotta.
I am afraid, sir, maybe you find her too liberal-minded.
She has, to my regret, a low opinion of social rules.
But now, if you allow, we, delegated from the Senate,
want to bring to you the gratitude and the joyful amazement of the noble assembly.
Your document announces a donation to us, so great and important, so unexpected and seldom these days.
It's hard for the citizen to preserve his paltry possessions.
Gold he arduously worked for runs through his fingers like water, and yet... taxes increase even more.
We endured it, mostly patiently and grumbling but rarely, since the treasure of our family's sanctity remained to us and the belief in our Madonna.
But there it breaks in like a wolf into the flock and robs us of our wives and kidnaps our daughters and without defence, without help...
But forgive me, sir, to complain to you about our sorrows was really not our delegation's intention.
For the first ray of light, after scared days, we have to thank you!
The island's auspicious name, for us it augurs well.
Do you remember, Signorina, a rider this morning, his black horse took fright at the sight of the coaches.
The Duke Adorno... right of objection... we're dependent...
What could he object...
- l was very amused.
- You are cruel.
And if, by falling off his horse, an arm or leg were broken...
A glance from my eyes, isn't it worth it for you?
I'd gladly give my life for you, yet...
And if this were just what I wanted?
And I'd like to see you small and low and poor, far beneath me, reachable to my feet...
The dead are poor.
But dead and mute.
I love the soul that fights and struggles, that sacrifices itself and suffers for love's reward.
If you're dead one day, what use is my love to you then?
Have you gone mad, young lady!
The answer... I will think about it
and I will answer you tomorrow.
Wait, Vitelozzo! Why in such a hurry?
- Listen!
- We're in danger!
He is to hand us over to those lousy citizens!
- The access to the underground hall!
- By Madonna,
- We must stop it!
- let me go!
Talk to Adorno!
Do what you want, but leave me out of it!
- But you... one word!
- l know nothing, I want nothing, I am in love, I love...
The plague upon you!
That's settled then:
you'll give us one more day.
The Senate will request the Duke's permission first.
And tonight you will be my guest.
As now you are mine.
I beg my noble guests not to disdain my invitation, just a simple meal.
Signorina, your arm!
You're highly amusing,
- Sir Alviano, really...
- Do you feel better then?
I was scared; suddenly you reached for your heart
- Ah, little one, I am as fit as a fiddle.
But did my father not tell you about a request?
Yes, indeed.
So quickly you forget such important things?
- Well, you see... in front of the people it wouldn't have worked!
You must take me for a dolt, ignorant of life, naive and silly.
Yet I rarely have the pleasure to associate with pretty women... that's why that... do you understand?
Yes, really. Don't look so amazed.
I do paintings.
Animals and men, trees and lakes... the sky, the light... but I like best painting souls.
And you can?
I mean, do you succeed in painting souls?
I don't know whether I can, and if I fail then it seems to me it's not always my fault.
You hardly find models.
Only once it seemed to be successful.
The picture appeared, so wondrously fine.
Just an ugly shadow between chin and mouth...
Look there... and ponder and try as I would, it appeared again and again.
Already I thought it gone and banished for ever. There, all of a sudden, insidiously it crept out of the brushes and took root!
This picture I gave up.
A long time I didn't attempt anything.
But you... You I'd love to paint.
Damn it, are you out of your wits?
I see!
It had to happen.
I really thought you took me seriously, you were different from the others, the snakes with gentle faces, with enticing eyes and hearts like devils.
But just now I've seen it: the same look.
Oh, goodness, collect yourself!
Hush now!
Don't forget that you are speaking to a lady.
You do me wrong.
Hear me out.
Where the town widens and the view opens on to the countryside,
there I have a cottage for a studio.
Early in the morning, the lanes and squares still deserted and empty, when the wan morning light is lapping around the canvas, colourless and soft,
then to me it seems the right time for work.
A road goes past my cottage, lined by tall cypresses.
You often walked on it,
shy and bowed down, lost in thought...
Suddenly suspiciously watching the windows, whose curtains hide the observer.
But you did not see her.
Then arose, purple glowing, veils shimmering in a thousand colourings, shining mists like eerie heralds came along, announcing its approach: the sun...
And a second miracle took place:
I saw the small, wretched wanderer raise his head.
Every muscle tensed up in the frail body.
The arms raised up into the sky.
Thus he walked into the glare, towards the sun.
And I saw him becoming taller and taller, the figure was growing enormously.
My heart was beating.
Thus I was painting you, Signor Alviano.
Thus I was painting your figure:
walking towards the sun.
But still I need the face and still I need the drunken eye
in which all beauty will be reflected.
I am ashamed... I don't know... pardon me... I have never felt like this in my life!
Will you come to my studio so that I can complete the painting?
I'll be glad to come.
He's playing cat and mouse with us.
He has become far too mighty, the noble sir!
His last triumph over Branciforte went to his head.
The people have spoilt him.
- After all, they are indebted to him. - They pay him.
A noble mercenary, nothing more.
- How are things going?
- He didn't say.
Not for and against.
On the one hand it would be welcome for the people of Genoa, on the other hand the aristocracy would regret if it were to lose a valuable property.
His heart would beat for the people, would decide in its favour.
But fairness and consideration for his friends would call him for caution, he ought to think it over and discuss it and similar catchphrases.
With all his heart he envies us the donation.
He detests the whole affair.
The man of the day is Alviano Salvago!
The whole town is praising his name.
My daughter Carlotta, who is not easily conquered, spoke of him often, imagining his character.
Now he has taken her by storm.
Duke Adorno ought to be wary!
He ought to be wary, Duke Adorno!
Do you hear it?
- This is the public mood.
- Does the mob frighten you?
You spoke differently yesterday.
Well, yesterday...
Don't remind me!
Do you speak to your friend like this?
But isn't it enough that I disdain myself?
is your mockery supposed to turn a knife in my wounds and my friends' laughter to drive me mad?
What ails you, Tamare?
I do not recognize you.
The most brilliant gentleman of my court, like nobody else honoured,
beloved, idolized by the women, constantly in the mood for the most incredible pranks.
There are people who only see the light and darkness is alien to them.
I was one of that kind.
Life seemed to me a source of constant joy from which I drank with thirsty gulps, careless, without thinking.
When I stretched out my hand, I held the rose, drew in its fragrance and pulled the petals off.
When I dropped to the ground, I fell softly on moss, thorns shunned me as well as sharp stones.
When a friend poured out his heart to me I heard him perfectly well, but I did not understand him.
And now I have experienced at once all torment of hell, humiliation and disgrace.
Explain yourself.
Beautiful as the daylight, but not of equal rank with me...
- a bourgeois child. - Well.
And then?
When I spoke to her the first time I think I did not understand her right.
She asked for a sacrifice as a pledge of my love.
But what she desired...
a lot of nonsense, madness, born at that moment I tried to understand, to interpret following the rules of courtly manners.
After a night of battling I thought I'd found it and mounted my horse, free and proud like a god, my filled heart puffed up with noble feelings.
And I rode through the town and, lost in dreams, I drew up the courting and I saw the beauty flush happily, stunned and moved by the honour!
A Count Andrae Vitelozzo Tamare offers heart and hand...
You are really mad.
Be patient, Duke!
When I stood before her, like the first time, at once I fell in despair.
The strange look in her eyes, her cool and amazed smile confused me.
And since I finally got her ""No"", I completely lost the remnants of my senses.
I threw myself at her feet, about my possessions I wildly talked gibberish.
Clasping her knees I implored her for forgiveness and mercy!
Tamare, pull yourself together.
Do you hear, Vitelozzo?
The PodestÁ's daughter, Carlotta.
An important painter once mentioned her name to me as that of a rare talent.
I'd like to warn you for some reasons, but I know the futility of such an action and how he who warns is detested by him who loves unfortunately.
That's why I prefer helping you instead of giving advice to you.
Ah, if you could... I will court for you.
You don't know this woman.
But I know women.
That's why I hope for you.
But promise me one thing:
Listen, Duke, I want to forget her.
I want to forget her.
But first she has to be mine.
That'll stir up bad feelings!
We are bound by law and order like everybody else.
My friends sent me to appeal to you:
you may prevent that Alviano's island, Elysium,
- pass into the town's possession.
- Damn it, what has Salvago, what has the island to do with your heinous intrigues?
On that island an artificial grotto makes wonderful rooms accessible,
especially created for love's celebrations.
When you enter the grotto, a blue light dazzles your eyes.
Heavy fragrances confuse your senses, crimson flames, flaring up like visions, distant music and soft singing lure you deeper and deeper.
A narrow path leads to the cave's entrance, hidden by shrubs of roses.
But if someone discovers the grotto's secret then we are lost.
Does Salvago know about your doing?
Salvago, ha ha!
A whim of nature, if you like, a strange caprice.
Genoa's ugliest man is the creator of this adventure,
of this materialized idea of beauty.
And he himself... He himself keeps away.
Maybe he has regrets.
But I don't understand it.
The torches' glow gilds everything.
In the orgy's frenzy ugliness becomes beautiful, and beauty becomes ugly.
The contrasts vanish in the rapture!
And this fool Salvago, after he cultivated on his land blooms of vice and poisonous plants of sin... he gives up the land and himself and you?
Yet he did not consider how difficult it is to control passion, once it is unbridled.
That is my curse: your immoderation.
Your unbridled passion compels me to actions I condemn!
I will rescue what can still be rescued.
I will keep my promise to you because your love keeps you from the company of miscreants and because of our friendship since youth.
Beware, Vitelozzo, you have been warned of violence.
Salvago ought to restrain his urge for donation for a long time.
This benefactor of people, he will obey, or woe to him and woe to you all!
Our times are full of strange things.
I knew a woman, like me she learned to paint at the Antwerp School, she painted hands.
Fine, slim hands with delicate blue-veined structures, rough and strong fists of men,
a woman's hand with rings, voluptuous and tender, with nails, pointed and rosy, flashing like drops of pale blood.
There I saw a hand which dug its nails in healthy flesh and another plucked with gentle fingers a twig, growing out of green bushes.
But the oddest thing was one painting:
a hand, waxen and pale, pale as death, with weird long and skinny fingers,
it was grasping something you could not see.
Only a faint reddish gleam penetrated the eerie fingers, but this glow was like a silent dirge,
like a suppressed moaning cry, like a scream, restrained and in mortal fear,
like a restrained cry for release...
But, the painting's meaning?
The poor one probably never felt what inspires artists to great works:
the happiness of love or the ardent desire for it.
She may have been anxious that once on her path of life she might encounter an event, some sensuously intoxicating charm to which she would surrender.
How strange, fear of happiness?
The driving force of this poor life was greed for fame and the fountain from which it was nourished was pain.
Not mentally, a physical pain.
Your hand, Signorina, is not as steady as your voice, if you want to paint...
My hand is quite steady and the story soon comes to an end.
My friend suffered from her heart since her youth.
All too often it would beat too passionately and sometimes she felt as if a merciless hand clutched at the twitching thing and squeezed it, dreadful and aching,
so that it may come to rest!
This hand, this cruel hand
she painted and her pain, too.
Even though you deny it, you are deeply moved, so it really touched you?
I loved her...
So she died?
I think she is still alive.
Tell me of your youth or why you are so gloomy and in such a bad mood today... or rather why your eyes so fearfully evade mine.
What have I done? Are you angry with me?
Why should I who am so good to you be as vicious and evil as you describe me?
I implore you, don't be angry with me!
Just have some patience with me!
I don't understand: it is like a dream and I fear...
No, do not fear!
You are a man and totally without any self-confidence.
is it so unthinkable that a woman should find herself in love and friendship for you?
The old story!
But the way you look, with eyes whose glow alone is promise...
And if it were more...
I do not say it is...
Should there be on this earth among millions of beating hearts not to be found one that strives for you in love?
For me... me who hates himself, who flees from himself, who banished the mirrors out of his rooms!
A fool you are!
Who like nobody else clings to that which slips away like a day in May:
this bit of beauty which leaves us women when the first furrow is on its way!
We are scarcely conscious of spring, when buds turn to fruit.
The leaves wither and fall.
And this should be the one thing?
Did you never go out on a sunny day, gloomy and sad, without knowing why?
And not even the most outstanding person, not the most flourishing tree could rescue you from your anxiety.
But if, on a glorious day, in a bed of the loveliest flowers, you were to find a grim monster which put you in a bad mood?
But I notice one thing:
you evade me, once with looks, now with words.
But I have to tell you.
Carlotta, consider...
You shall know that I love you.
Carlotta!
For God's sake, Signor, how you do stare at me!
There, take my hands, kiss them quickly!
But let me go on working.
I need your eyes for my painting.
Thus they are right for me.
Beloved!
I beg you, do not speak.
For God's sake, Carlotta, I must at your feet.
I am happy beyond words.
I beg you, stay.
Just look at me and consider that never again will you be lonely and unloved despite your ugliness.
See how calmly I say the word which tormented you for so long.
Now it's over.
Since it's a word... and a concept...
But you must be good to me, Alviano, and tender, my dear!
Because I am quite a fragile toy.
That's it, it's finished.
Now come and hold me.
I am exhausted, yet you must...
For all saints' sake...
Dear, what happens to you?
You sweet, poor one...
You loveliest one!
You gave life to me, you gave back to me the belief in God and mankind.
I want to consecrate to you all I have.
I want to spread myself out beneath your feet.
I want to be infinitely good to you and tender.
Lady!
Duke Adorno!
The Duke, what on earth can he want?
Please tell him to wait.
Since yesterday I have been hearing voices everywhere.
Singing in the air and murmuring in the bushes...
Carlotta's silvery laugh a while ago, but probably it was a delusion.
Ah, sir, how changed and happy I am since the day you first entered my house.
Your daughter, so soon to be my wife, how beautiful beyond words she is, so full of sincere kindness.
But you are reserved.
What troubles you, PodestÁ?
I am bewildered and dazzled.
What you have just shown me, it is incredible that the brain of a single man should have thought up this realm of magic!
Many people helped me.
The artists were active.
I only contributed the yearning.
- But where is Carlotta?
- Come on, let us look for her.
Did you not hear?
They are looking for you, Carlotta, and you hide yourself in the shadows. Then you run away from your fiancé?
Don't think badly of me, Duke.
After all I don't know what happens to me.
Yesterday when I answered you ""No"" for Count Vitelozzo I felt proud and secure, grand and joyful.
But yet, since I finished the painting, which pleased you so much,
the portrait of Alviano,
it seems to me as if something had grown weary within me, as if my love were no longer the same.
Not poorer, don't get me wrong.
But as though now he had given me his all, his everything and as though I had nothing... nothing more to expect.
And further... yet I don't know if a woman's conflicting feelings are of interest to you or whether they provoke your scorn, Duke?
Pray, trust me, how true and authentic you are,
Signorina!
I came to this island full of secret fear.
As if I had drunk wine, heavy and mixed with enchanting herbs, or that strange drink, brewed with the blood from the heart of a love-stricken virgin!
suddenly enjoying nakedness, displaying its charms for the rejoicing eyes of the loving youth!
""But if, on a glorious day,""
""in a bed of the loveliest flowers,""
""you were to find a grim monster...""
- For God's sake, young lady...
- Let me go, Duke!
Calm down then; the sole joyful hour, you said it yourself, he owes to you.
This may console you.
You shall not console me.
I do not want any mercy.
Torture and hatred I do deserve, desperation and death!
So listen to one last thing.
He was not worthy and did not deserve your love.
He is not the noble man you think he is.
He is obsessed by evil desire and today it befalls him... I won't hear anything.
You try to defame him, but he is noble and sublime and I am miserable and depraved.
I hate myself and the world and you.
Only the night... this very night I love and its shadows.
Then God may have mercy upon you.
Come now, I'll take you to your father.
But leave me here!
Ah, what a night!
What a glowing summer night!
I want to crawl into its dark light, dive into its shining darkness!
With stars I'll dance the summer night's dance, but with goblins I'll sleep in the bushes.
Where is my bride?
Has no one seen Carlotta?
Why are you fleeing from me?
No, I am not fleeing from you.
You know me then?
But if it were someone who loves you, beauty?
But let me peep at your face to see whether your eyes are bright or dull.
Are you Alviano?
No, you aren't.
Of nice build, a handsome man.
O beautiful Carlotta, how strangely you speak!
Strangely, my love?
Give me your hand, ah, it's soft and hot, and it feels pleasant.
Do you feel my heart beating passionately!
For you, my dear! For you!
But listen, young man, you hold it gently with your soft hands, you must not torment it, you clasp it, gently and softly.
- The night is short, dawn is close!
- Sweet is the night,
- Feel my heart beating.
- Let us hurry, the night is short, dawn is close!
- For you!
- For you!
I hear her voice!
It resounds to me from heights and chasms a thousand times!
Singing from the air, a mocking song from the depths of hell!
Or was she not?
- Vivat Alviano Salvago!
- He gave us joy!
Bearer of beauty!
Father of the people!
Be silent!
I am not a king.
A fool, a cripple!
A beggar, a monster!
Bring her to me!
I will be grateful.
I'll give you all my worldly goods.
Then I will be prince, king, god!
But give me Carlotta!
I will be grateful!
Vivat Alviano, Apollo!
The Muses' friend!
Crown the king!
Where is the crown, the crown of rosaries?
This people's friend, lift him up!
Crown him with roses!
Cheers for Alviano!
Stop it, no, stop it...
Stop it, people of Genoa!
Stop it, beguiled people!
Madmen you are!
You crown the one who kidnapped your daughters, who seduced and abused your children, perhaps killed!
The Council of Eight!
Dreadful!
- Alviano?
- Don't believe him!
- l see!
- The Alberghi.
- The sly dogs!
- lt's done cleverly!
- These envious persons!
- Slander!
- Cheers for Alviano!
Listen to the Council of Eight!
Through the Holy Council of Eight, I, Duke Adorno, the people's protector and loyal friend, bring a charge against the knight Alviano Salvago.
I accuse him of kidnapping girls, of seduction and rape, committed against virgins, of procuring
- and encouragement to the same.
- Was there not a scream?
Did you not hear a scream?
of having bewitched the people.
We cast a ban on the island Elysium.
It shall be devastated by fire, as a breeding ground of vices and devilish sin.
Sir Salvago, you...
You see, it comes down to this!
- They rob us!
- They grudge us the joy!
Cursed thieves!
Beasts!
- Down with Adorno!
- Death to the Alberghi!
Kill the bastards!
- lt's all a lie!
- Alviano, speak!
- We believe you!
We stand by you!
Alviano, speak!
We protect you!
For you!
- Don't you hear it?
- Feel my heart beating.
The night is short, dawn is close.
Cymbals, flutes, harps... and wild singing?
You see, he is obsessed, the demon speaks through him!
Alviano, listen, it's a matter of life and death.
They will interrogate him under torture.
Lead him away!
Him who is silent we trust more than you who speak.
He did us good.
If you want to arrest him, give us proof!
Bring along that woman.
Take your veil off, Ginevra!
Ginevra Scotti!
For God's sake, let me go!
Speak frankly and without reserve, Ginevra Scotti.
Where were you hidden, before you fled to Duke Adorno, seeking help?
In the house of Alviano Salvago.
- Hear!
- Hear this!
What are you waiting for?
Why don't you move?
Old man, have mercy and let me go!
I begin to realize, terribly clearly...
Speak frankly and without reserve, Signorina Scotti.
Who robbed you of freedom and honour?
A nobleman who called himself Menaldo Negroni.
The Alberghi!
- Look!
- Listen!
Yet, what about Salvago?
Spit out the truth!
Old man, she is in danger, I see the correlation before me!
The head of this gang of wild fellows, of noble robbers, is Alviano Salvago.
All this was brought before the Duke by Count Vitelozzo Tamare.
Who spoke the name?
Who snatched it from my brain?
He kidnapped her.
He was after her.
He courted her. I know it, know it...
Are you raving?
Count Vitelozzo kidnapped Ginevra?
Who talks about Ginevra?
I don't know anything about her!
You cur!
You rake!
If I had hold of you, I'd tear you to pieces, you beast!
Come on, I'll lead you.
Do you see the blue light up there?
Listen!
is this not music?
Wild and lascivious, screams and rejoicing...
People of Genoa!
I will lead you to your dishonoured daughters!
To my poor, lost bride!
Then I'll justify myself to you and you shall judge.
But woe to the others!
Death upon them!
You're wrong. I say the truth.
Listen, it might well be that she will not wake up any more,
that she will pass away into the other world.
And see, for me it meant so much.
I had nothing else.
In my whole life this woman was the only great, the only wonderful thing.
Realize, if you say to me:
""l kidnapped her, I took her by force,""
But deep within me would still persist something, understand me, something like an aching consolation.
But if you say to me:
""She gave herself to me,""
""she, Carlotta, willingly, in love,""
""and she was happy,"" yes, precisely, you said ""happy"",
then, then... then I had nothing, well, then you took nothing from me, then I am once again as miserable... just as miserable as I was...
Thrown back into nothingness...
Even if you kill me, I know nothing else to tell you. Only one thing:
this woman became a slave to me from the first day I saw her, Alviano, according to your saying once,
You fancied yourself strong, for one hour, but you were not.
Pleasure presented itself to you, there you avoided it, trembling and cowardly.
You only saw the darkness, the shadows, danger and sin.
Too bitterly branded for life you became by fate broken-winged, inhibited, self-conscious.
For did not, Alviano, as you said, Carlotta also give herself to you?
Why did you not take her?
Because, because...
You devil, do not request that, before you go to hell, I reveal for all the world to see a crime
so ghastly...
Because I look into depths you can't even imagine, since I am a man and you?
I don't know which one of us is looking deeper.
I don't know what is to be rated higher:
a joyless life, a gradually wasting away or a death in rapture and transfiguration, in passionate embrace a blissful dying!
What happens to me?
Your words' meaning, but this is not possible...
Her lips asked for mercy, incoherently they stammered the old song of fearful resistance.
But her eyes begged for lust.
An agonizing confession escaped from her lips, fear and horror...
But from her eyes, boundless, wild, sparks of roused desire were flashing.
At last it forced its way:
greater than you, she made herself free.
The sparkling dance of her laughing eyes was joined by the inebriate song of her lips:
""Grant death,"" her eyes rejoiced,
- ""Grant happiness,"" craved her speech.
- Dreadful!
Wretch, knowingly you have...
Roll your eyes, bare your teeth and clench your fists!
My most blissful hour, no one can take it away from me!
Then say a prayer!
You're unable to get at me, what do you want?
At a parish fair a hunchbacked fiddler stroke up a graceful tune.
The most beautiful one of the beauties was his love.
I picked her out of the dancing crowd and took her away.
He rushed after me, he stood before me like this one, his features contorted, contorted and full of hate!
With his fiddle I killed him.
Come on then, with my hands I shall strangle all of you!
Then die, scoundrel!
Who was yelling there?
Was it not... my love?
No, no, look at me, Alviano...
Carlotta, beloved... I am with you, he lied, lied, lied!
Away, away!
A troll!
A nightmare!
Ugh, how heavy this bears!
And the red light!
Woe, woe!
No, give me wine.
And my love shall come, my handsome, sweet... I want Vitelozzo ere I die... I want, I want...
Yes, but where is the fiddle... At last I must go to the parish fair.
And my cap, my nice cap...
Red with silver bells.
Has no one seen the cap?
Leave me, I must at last...
Wait... what was that?
There is someone lying there...
Good people, there lies a dead man.
A presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures.
BENJAMIN CHRISTENSEN wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1919 and 1921.
For the photography I am grateful to Mr. Johan Ankerstjerne and to Mr. Richard Louw for the art direction.
My main sources are mentioned in the theatre's playbill.
Let us look into the history of mysticism and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the Witch.
The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind.
When primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible, the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits.
In Persia, the imaginary creatures depicted in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases.
The English scientist Rawlinson and French scientist Maspero show us pictures of evil spirits, believed to have resided amongst the first civilizations.
The belief in evil spirits, sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions about the mystery of the universe.
Here we see how the Egyptians perceived the shape of the world (according to Maspero).
The ancient Egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides.
The sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains.
The stars, like lamps, hung from the sky on ropes.
According to the beliefs of other ancient civilizations, the sky was vaulted and the earth shaped into terraces.
The evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval folklore to devils, sneaking around and tempting children.
The devils lived in the earth's core.
In the latter part of the Middle Ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe.
Above the earth and its waters -
- the medieval man first imagined a layer of air -
- then a layer of fire - - and outside the fire were the planets, moving celestial bodies.
Each planet was attached to its transparent, movable sphere.
And outside the planetary spheres were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own.
Above it all, in the tenth crystal sphere, sits the Almighty surrounded by nine choirs of angels and He is the One keeping the spheres revolving.
Deep down in the earth's core lies Hell, where those tempted by the Devil shall suffer forever.
In the upper part of the following picture
(from the French historian Lacroix) The devils are stuffing the damned into large pots.
A sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the cauldrons.
A devil pours the nasty sulfur oozing from a horn down a man's throat.
Two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth.
I have found a strange old mechanical presentation of Hell, which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the Middle Ages.
Observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the cauldrons!
During the Middle Ages, devils and Hell were considered real and constantly feared.
Witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the Devil, and therefore they were burned at the stake.
The floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air.
This picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from "German Life in the Past in Pictures."
In this image a witch is milking an ax handle.
In the following image a witch has bewitched a man's shoe.
Witches usually meet in councils.
And after the gathering they might, for instance, sneak into a barn and bewitch a cow.
The small angular symbol, noticeable under the drawing, was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches.
In this old naive drawing, a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells, setting a village on fire.
Witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer's powder and magic potions.
Notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed. That was habitual in the past.
It was a general belief that the witch was naked when, at night, during the so-called Witch Sabbath, she danced with the devils.
Women who wanted to participate in the "Sabbath" sneaked away to the sorcerer where they could have their backs smeared with "witch ointment".
The witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air.
The French doctors Bourneville and Teinturier gave me the following pictures of the Witch Sabbath a secret satanic rite to which thousands of women asserted their participation.
At the Sabbath witches and sorcerers first desecrate the Church's holy cross.
Satan gives all the participants devils' names.
And a ceremonial banquet is held.
The Sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows.
All witches had to show the Devil their respect by kissing his behind.
After a merry dance with the devils, the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock.
These scenes are often found on famous Witch Sabbath pictures from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
To be continued.
THE WITCH Chapter 2.
We go now to the underground home of a sorceress in the year of the Lord 1488.
"Tonight the stars shine favorably over the gallows' hill."
"Ugh, what a stench!
The thief's body has been hanging too long on the gallows."
"When such a thief's finger is too dried out, it can no longer lend the brew any healing power."
"Hurry and open up, Karna, so that the passers-by won't see me."
"Karna, can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church?"
"Here, young maiden, take a potion of cat feces and dove hearts, boiled in the moonlight."
"A drop of this in a man's drink will soften his heart at once."
"Karna, can I have an even stronger potion?"
"If the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love..."
I have a potion boiled in May from a young and playful male sparrow."
"Hold your coin, maiden!
First smell my ointment!"
"This salve is good, should you wish to travel to Brocken, one night."
"Secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber."
"You will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses."
"Listen Brother, I wonder...
shouldn't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise?"
"Oh Holy Mother, forgive us for cutting open a person's dead body with a knife!"
"It is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin..."
"...but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us."
"Help!
Hurry!
The peace of the cemetery has been desecrated by two witches."
Such were the Middle Ages, when witchcraft and the Devil's work were sought everywhere.
And that is why unusual things were believed to be true.
"Damned woman!
You shall not lie here and bewitch the legs of honest people."
"You watch out!
Now your filthy mouth shall remain open for eternity."
So it happens with witchcraft as with the Devil;
people's belief in him was so strong that he became real.
The Devil is everywhere and takes all shapes.
He shows himself as a nightmare, a raging demon, a seducer, a lover, and a knight.
The devils' companion can be young and beautiful, but she is more often old, poor and miserable.
Is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night, you poor old woman of the Middle Ages?
When the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes, the Devil fetches Apelone for his adventures.
High up in the air is Apelone's dream castle, and there the Devil will fulfill all her secret wishes.
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 3.
In "Rites and Rights in the German Past" by Franz Heinemann, we can observe pictures of inquisition judges at work.
A woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not.
In "History of Customs", Edward Fuchs shows us how the accused is tied up.
Two executioners use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support.
If she floats, she will be pulled up and burned.
If she sinks, the judges thank God for her innocence.
I will now illustrate a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the Pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to Germany.
"Oh, my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly, unless a sorceress had bewitched him!"
"Be comforted Anna, wife of the Printer, the power of lead will soon reveal it."
"Oh, you powerful Saturn, allow this lead to show if Jesper the Printer is bewitched."
"It is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft."
"Oh Peter, look, where is the evil sorceress?"
"You might see that witch, before you wish to..."
"...before I wish to."
"Jesus' Holy Cross and Wounds!
I did not hear you come, Maria the Weaver!"
"Oh, maiden, please have mercy on me, a poor woman who has to go begging from door to door!"
"Are you hungry, Maria?
If so, sit down."
"Here, eat now, if you can, in the name of Jesus."
"Watch out, little sister, watch out.
That woman has evil eyes."
"The youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden."
"How wonderful!
It felt like fire when the young maiden took my arm."
"Young maiden, you know quite well that what you're accusing this woman of, endangers her life?"
"Swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies!"
"Let's go, young men, before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won't turn us all into mice."
"Now you can have a scalding death, just what you deserve, you damned mistress of the Devil!"
THE WITCH Chapter 4.
Two "honest" matrons will change the accused in jail, so that she will not wear hidden witch powder.
"Maria the Weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft."
"Master, look carefully, there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress' hair."
The suspect's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges.
Two honorable men try amiably to persuade her to confess.
If she stubbornly denies her charges, they will use a kind of mental torture.
"Woman, see here the seven holy words of Jesus crucified, written on consecrated parchment."
"I will hang them around her neck, so that the Devil will no longer help her to be silent."
"Does she see this length of consecrated wax as Corpus Christi?"
The accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber, so as not to bewitch the judge when entering.
"For the last time I ask: Does she want to confess her witchcraft and her misdeeds?"
"Let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the harshness of her heart."
"Oh, you learned men!
How do you expect me to confess to that which is not true?"
"Well, Rasmus the Executioner!
Let now the evil witch's body sting."
"Let her catch her breath, Rasmus the Executioner, and loosen the screw a little at a time, as she confesses her sins."
"Oh, learned men!
I confess that I've given birth to many children fathered by the Devil."
"And when I gave birth, Karna and all her coven helped me."
"If I am spared the pain, I will confess that Trina has smeared me with witch ointment."
"Oh yes, learned men, miserable me has flown through the night air to Brocken on Trina's broom."
"And the Devil's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft."
"And many a woman, who had not accomplished enough evil deeds, was treated miserably by the Devil."
"And masses spat upon all that is holy."
"And a meal of toads and unchristened children was cooked by Karna."
"Listen, Maria the Weaver, did you also see how the Devil put his mark on the witches' foreheads?"
"Oh, learned men, I saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind."
"And Anna's mother, the wife of the Printer, who wished me a scalding death -"
"- that damned woman, I saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly... and Sissel, her servant, that old fool, was also there."
"And Elsa, who kicked me some time ago, she shall also burn at the stake."
"She passed Martin the Writer's door one moonlit night with her sister."
"And they cast a spell on Martin the Writer with the water they threw against his door."
"And it was the very same night that death took Martin the Writer."
"And now I will tell you everything about the witches, who yell after me in the street where I live."
THE WITCH Chapter 5.
In this way begins the endless turn of the wheels during the witchcraft era.
Each witch gives ten others away.
The town wardens busy themselves.
If you oppose the capture of a witch, you must be a witch yourself.
The destiny of young Anna, wife of the Printer, is sealed.
So now only two people are left in Jesper the Printer's haunted house.
During the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly, but it was not safe to be young and pretty either.
"Brother, help me. My thoughts are sinful."
"Bare your body, Brother!"
"I'll whip your sinful body and your poor soul, into faith healing."
"Oh Brother, why did you stop the beating of the scourge?
Now my soul will surely be damned."
"Father Henrik, Brother John is spellbound."
"A witch appears in his cell to tempt him."
"And she has grabbed him by the wrist."
"Stand up, Brother, Father Henrik is coming."
"Brother, you have not given the maiden away for a witch, have you?"
"You know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch?"
And so they fetch you too, young maiden, giving you their unfailing test.
"In the name of the Holy Trinity, if you are not a witch, you will now shed tears!"
"See for yourself - you cannot shed tears, as you are allied with the evil one."
We assume now that the young woman resists; that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess.
I have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances.
And I see in front of me some scenes, which I do not find pictured too darkly here, on the white screen.
"Wake up, young maiden!
I bring you great happiness."
"See, young maiden, I give you your freedom if you would just show me a small favor in return."
"Why do you taunt me, monk?
What favor can a poor creature like me show you?"
"Teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water!"
"If you do not want to take my word, young maiden, stand up and look out at the jail court."
"Did the guards leave?"
"Yes, they went far away, maiden.
The keys are now in my hand and I can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight."
"And I swear eternal silence to you, maiden, about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder."
"Do you remember, maiden, that Jesper, the Printer's child, is all alone in the world, without relatives besides you?"
"Oh, Father Henrik, see the tears of the young maiden.
Look, she cries, hence she cannot be a sorceress."
Don't you know that witches secretly smear themselves with spittle, so that we might believe it to be tears?"
"Here, maiden, see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonorable, rejected witch's offspring without you."
"Stand here and listen to all the maiden's words, so that later you may bear witness against her."
"And will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me, if I speak?"
"Then I will tell you that once a traveling stone cutter told me..."
"...that when witches call for thunder, they put their hands in the water..."
"You hardened witch!
Before the sun is down tomorrow, you will burn alive at the stake."
"And then they will burn you too, maiden, "as edification for man, as sweet scent for God."
And one pyre after another burns in the town square, until the judges will one day move on to the next town.
The witch madness, like a spiritual plague, ravages wherever these judges go.
In the arc of a few centuries, over 8 million women, men and children were burned as witches.
THE WITCH Chapter 6.
There are witch confessions that are totally insane.
But there are also confessions, which might very well be close to the truth, namely during the times when superstition ruled.
Many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by "tying knots!"
For each knot a pregnancy is destroyed.
And the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses.
Many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects.
But, if we should judge from the confessions, we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber.
You and I would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools. Isn't that so?
The French doctor Paul Regnard describes the way this collar was used.
The collar was tightened with the help of four taut ropes.
The wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor.
When a fire bowl was put under the poor victim -
- his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck.
Doctor Regnard shows another picture, which speaks for itself.
It is simply called "After the interrogation."
The "painful interrogation" preferably began with a "lighter" torture:
The thumbscrew, for example.
One of my actresses insisted on trying the thumbscrew when we shot these pictures.
I will not reveal the terrible confessions I forced from the young lady in less than a minute.
In the convents during the Middle Ages, fear of the Devil escalated into an almost hopeless despair.
The pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self-punishment.
Often a single nun was seized, and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was overtaken by insanity -
- a mysterious, contagious insanity.
In writings that have survived to this day, these unhappy women wrote down with touching simplicity how the Devil penetrated the convent.
"Get thee behind me, Satan!"
"May all good saints stand by me!
Sister Cecilia is conniving with the evil one."
How these religious women must have suffered, before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out?
In their biographies, this desperate cry is always found:
The devil forced us into it!
"Oh, Holy Mother, the evil has a terrible power!"
"Look, now he forces me into doing what I want the least."
"Burn me at the stake, pious fathers!
Can't you see what the Devil forces me to do?"
"Take me!
Don't you see him?
The evil one stands over there and threatens me."
THE WITCH Chapter 7.
We pass over the Devil's actual possessions
(speaking in tongues and convulsions) And come to present times.
The majority of witches in the old days were poor women; those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays.
One or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era.
Let us not believe that the Devil belongs solely to the past.
- and said: "The Devil is real.
I have seen him sitting at my bedside."
With the old woman's permission, I show here the prayer book in which a woman (from 1921!
Thinks she can tell the Devil by sight.
The witch's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that I will try to exemplify here.
I ask my viewer to understand that in the following I let the same actress portray many different patients of related nervous disorders.
I have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep.
Why did she always enact the very same thing she was most afraid she would do?
She stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own.
Isn't there something "witch-like" with this sleepwalker, who moves through the slumbering household with her matches?
Doesn't she remind us of the nun, who walks through the chapel with her knife, forced by the Devil?
This poor woman, also in a bewildered condition, does during her sleep just what she fears the most.
These possessions - these somnambulistic, dazed conditions - are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria.
And there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person.
We remember for instance that the witch received nightly visitations by the Devil.
Today it is not the Devil, but rather a famous actor, a popular clergyman or a well-known doctor, who disturbs the calm of the night.
The hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window.
Notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed.
A person afflicted by hysteria always displays some artificial mannerisms.
In the Middle Ages it was believed that during the Sabbath the Devil put some invisible marks on the witch's body, where all sensitivity vanished.
The executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused.
"I see clearly that you are a witch.
You do not even feel the master's instrument on your back."
Today, this strange insensitivity is considered a symptom of hysteria.
"No sir, I do not feel you touching my back at all."
"Yes, it is as I thought; your daughter is suffering from hysteria."
"From what you told me, I must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic."
"It would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police."
Poor little hysterical witch!
In the Middle Ages you were in conflict with the church.
Now it is with the law.
"I ask you to step into my office."
"Or do you prefer that I call the police?"
"Your name?
Do you have a card?"
"Your address?
Do you have a telephone in your home?"
"Thank you, that's fine.
I will contact you later."
"If my family learns about this, I will be forcefully detained."
"I beg you to understand that I am an unhappy, sick person.
I do not know what I am doing."
"I have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war.
I am a broken person."
"It is as if an unknown power compels me to commit this terrible theft."
"Look here!
I just stole this little, expensively bound Russian book."
"What shall I do with it?
I do not know a word of Russian."
"My husband died in the war, and I have not been the same since..."
"I promise not to pursue this matter, but I have to ask you never to visit my store again."
Centuries have passed and the Almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere.
We no longer sit in church staring terrified at the frescoes of the devils.
The witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops.
But isn't superstition still rampant among us?
Is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now?
We no longer burn our old and poor.
But do they not often suffer bitterly?
And the little woman, whom we call hysterical, alone and unhappy, isn't she still a riddle for us?
Nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or if she is wealthy - in a modern clinic.
And then we will console ourselves with the notion that the mildly temperate shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of medieval times.

Chronicle of the Great Death in Wisborg anno Domini 1838, by...
NOSFERATU
Does this word not sound to you like the midnight cry of the Deathbird.
Take care in saying it, lest life's images fade into shadows, and ghostly dreams rise from your heart and nourish themselves on your blood.
Long have I contemplated the origin and recession of the Great Death in my hometown of Wisborg.
Here is its story:
There lived in Wisborg Hutter and his young wife Ellen
Why did you kill them... the lovely flowers...?
Not so fast, my young friend!
No-one outruns his destiny.
There was also a property agent by the name of Knock- the subject of all sorts of rumours.
One thing was certain: he paid his people well
Count Orlok
- His Lordship... from Transylvania... wishes to acquire a beautiful home in our little town...
You could earn a nice bit of money of course the price is a little effort... some sweat and perhaps... a little blood...
He wants a fine, deserted house...
That house... directly across from yours.
Offer him that one!
Travel quickly, travel well, my young friend, into the land of the spectres.
I'm travelling far, far away into the land of thieves and spectres.
So Hutter placed the anguished girl in the care of his friends, the rich shipowner Harding and his sister
Be at ease.
and young Hutter travelled many dusty roads, but at last the peaks of the Carpathians loomed before him.
The horses strained harder
Quickly... something to eat -
I have to get to Count Orlok's castle!
You shouldn't go any further now;
the Werewolf roams the woods.
Of Vampyres Gastlie Spirits, Bewitchments and the Seven Deadlie Sins
Of Vampyres Gastlie Spirits, Bewitchments and the Seven Deadlie Sins
Onward!
Offer what you like! We're not going any further!
We won't go on!
It's frightening beyond the pass!
No sooner had Hutter stepped across the bridge, than the eerie visions he had often told me about seized hold of him.
You have kept me waiting - waiting too long. -
Now it is nearly midnight.
The servants are sleeping!
End of the 1st Act.
Nosferatu 2nd Act.
You have hurt yourself...
Precious blood!
Shouldn't we like to sit together a bit, dear friend?
It is a while still till sunrise - and in the daytime I sleep, my dear fellow, I sleep the deepest of sleeps -
Just as the sun rose, the shadows of the night withdrew from Hutter as well
My dear!
My dearest!
Grieve not that thy beloved is so far away
I am plagued by mosquitoes.
I already have two bites on my throat, one quite near the other, on each side
One dreams so heavily in this desolate castle, but fear not.
The spectral evening light seemed to revive the shadows of the castle once more
Your wife has a lovely neck...
I shall buy the house...
The fine, deserted house opposite yours...
At night this same Nosferatu doth clutch his victim and doth suck like hellish life-potion its blood.
Take heede that his shadow not encumber thee like an incubus with gruesome dreams
At the same hour.
A doctor... a doctor!
Harmless congestions of the blood.
The doctor related Ellen's distress to me as an unknown illness.
I know, however, that her soul that night caught the cry of the Deathbird -
Nosferatu was already spreading his wings. -
Yet with the morning light Hutter set out to make sense of the horror of his nights. -
The raftsmen didn't know what kind of unholy cargo they were conveying through the dale.
End of the 2nd Act.
Nosferatu 3rd Act.
He was brought to the hospital yesterday by some farmers.
They said he must have fallen.
He's still feverish...
Nosferatu was on his way. The danger for Wisborg drew nigh.
The Paracelsian Professor Bulwer, who at that time was studying the secrets of nature and their deepest unifying principles, told me the following:
Earth-filled coffins were to be loaded onto the double-masted ship, the Empusa
The vessel's still set for sail tonight.
Bill of Lading:
EMPUSA
Route: from GALAZ to WISBORG
Cargo: 6 crates of earth (experimental purposes)
In those days, I should note, Prof. Bulwer was explaining to his students the cruel habits of carnivorous plants.
They observed in horror nature's mysterious ways.
Like a vampire - isn't it?
It seems that the approach of the strangler, Nosferatu, already compelled the property agent Knock into his shadow.
The patient admitted yesterday is going mad...
Blood is life!
And this one here a polyp with tentacles transparent...
almost incorporeal almost but a phantom...
Ellen was often seen on the beach within the solitude of the dunes. Yearning for her beloved, her eyes scanned waves and distance alike.
My dearest!
Grieve not that thy beloved is so far away
I am plagued by mosquitoes.
I already have two bites on my throat, one quite near the other, on each side
One dreams so heavily in this desolate castle, but fear not.
No I must go...
by the shortest route home!
A plague epidemic has broken out in Transylvania and the Black Sea ports of Varna and Galaz.
All victims exhibit the same peculiar stigmata on the neck, the origin of which still puzzles the doctors.
The Dardanelles were closed to all ships suspected of carrying the plague.
A sailor's fallen ill below deck.
It spread through the ship like an epidemic.
The first stricken sailor pulled the entire crew after him into the dark grave of the waves.
In the light of the sinking sun, the captain and ship's mate bid farewell to the last of their comrades.
I'm going below!
If I'm not back up in ten minutes...
The ship of death had acquired its new captain.
End of the 3rd Act.
Nosferatu 4th Act.
I must go to him.
The master is near...
The master is near...!
Long have I pondered why Nosferatu was said to have travelled with earth-filled coffins.
I found it recorded that vampyres can only draw their shadowy strength from the accursed earth in which they were buried.
Thank God... you're safe...
All's well now...
Looked over everything...
Not a living soul on board.
Varna - 12 July
Crew - minus myself as captain: one helmsman; one ship's mate;
Second day - 13 July one sailor ill with fever
Course:
SSW Wind:

Third day - 14 July ship's mate is babbling claims strange passenger is below deck

Danger of plague!

PROCLAMATION
It is hereby decreed that the honourable magistrate of this town forbids the populace to transport the ill or plague-stricken to the hospital, lest the plague spread through the streets.
End ofthe 4th Act.
Nosferatu 5th Act.
Hutter made Ellen swear not to touch the book which had frightened him with its visions. -
Yet she could not resist its bizarre attraction.
At night this same Nosferatu doth clutch his victim and doth suck like hellish life-potion its blood.
Take heede that his shadow not encumber thee like an incubus with gruesome dreams
This is what I see - each evening...!
Fear lurked in every corner of the town.
Who was still well?
Who already ill?
I'll run over there quickly...
I'll fetch Sievers...
The panic-stricken town was looking for a victim:
it was Knock.
Someone saw him!
He ran outside!
He strangled the custodian...
He strangled him...
the vampire!
I LOVE YOU
Bulwer!
Fetch Bulwer!
Knock has been captured!
The master... the master...!
The master... is... dead.
witness the miracle on the heels of the truth:
at that very hour, the Great Death came to an end, and as if confronted by the victorious radiance of the living sun, the shadow of the Deathbird was dispersed.

Any 35 mm. Cut of this film seems to be lost nowadays.
It was possible to correct its many defects analogically, since they were printed on the internegative.
In 2004, Fernardo Martín Peña was in charge of a restoration, taking account of some documents given by María del Carmen Vieites and Andrés Insaurralde.
Finally, the actions of some lost scenes are now synthesized in contemporary intertitles.
MY SORREL HORSE
It was a day like any other, in a country village...
A stranger arrives at The Thump Inn with an unbranded sorrel horse.
Silvestre:
Nelo Cosimi.
Give me something to drink, boy.
Sir, I need a bed for me, and some hay for my horse.
Sir, have you seen any rough bullocks around here?
Good heavens!
It's always the same! Those punks behave terribly!
Last night, the kid tried to save a bottle from death and got a black eye good enough for a national mourn!
That night, Silvestre attends one of inn's quaint gatherings.
You cheater!
Tonight the party is a little bit dull, old man!
Nobody steals from me playing cards, you bastards!
Amancio, the true lord in town, the son of the Judge...
A womanizer whose only law was his own caprice. He had turned his home into the target of gossip, and his wife into a martyr.
Can't you stay at home for a minute?
Eulalia's ranch is more attractive to you, right?
Those are just gossips!
Don't pay any attention to them!
Stop being so childish!
I'm tired of your jealousy
A happy coincidence got Silvestre and Eulalia together.
It was nothing, my girl.
Just a little fright.
According to the plans the railways will cross the river.
I'll do your shopping for you, my lady.
Yes, I live nearby, just a mile from here... I live in my dad's ranch. We're being thrown out of it.
And they say we have fair laws...
She's not bad at all, my boy!
The eagle patiently waited for the pigeon to fly by, giving his feast for granted.
I need to speak to you alone.
It's about that eviction.
I pulled some strings and everything has been postponed.
Thank you so much!
And I'll get you more than that. You'll be able to stay forever.
God bless you, Amancio!
And couldn't that bless be a kiss from you?
A happy return, with good news at last to mitigate the sadness of her old folks.
Daddy, back in town they say We won't be thrown out of here.
People say a lot of rubbish around here, my child.
I know them very well, unfortunately.
Silvestre tells the owner of The Thump Inn how he found his horse when it was just an abandoned colt.
Two years later...
We understand each other very well after all this time.
No man should dare riding it when I whistle.
A beautiful story, but completely useless with the police.
If you can't prove that you own it, you'll lose your means of transport.
They may take it away from me.
But he who dares to ride it should have his last will ready.
It's a pity I don't have a rich uncle.
I'd let him go for a ride and then I'll share my inheritance with you!
Sir, you know my horse is also unbranded!
Don't worry, you stupid...
The authorities are in no economic condition
to keep that four-legged mummy of yours! Come on. This is a poor house, but you can knock at its door.
Dad, he is the one that helped me when my carriage stumbled.
Come forward, my friend. You're welcomed in my ranch!
You're not from here, right?
Do you come from a distant place?
A very distant place.
I came to work in this village.
I knew you had to be strong.
I was strong too, back in my old days.
You're not leaving so soon!
Let's get inside. It's too hot here.
Stay, Silvestre. My dad will enjoy chatting with you for a little while.
I inherited this sword from my grandfather, back in Güemes days.
If you don't accept, I'll have you evicted tomorrow!
So... Should I come tonight?
Come.
He's a good friend of my dad.
Of your dad only, I hope.
Well. See you tonight then!
Is this your horse?
He has no brand, but he does have an owner!
Get down immediately, you punk!
He took away from me the only thing I had!
Later, that night.
Eulalia!
Get inside, my child. I'll deal with this gentleman.
You'll pay for this.
The medicine!
Right after midnight, back at The Thump Inn.
Did you find yourself another horse, my friend?
Yes, I did
Unbranded, too?
Yes.
Colts have no brands in my farm!
You laugh now!
The soldier comes back home, and yearns for his beloved family.
It's done.
The eviction notices are signed, my friend.
Today we throw them out and our demolition begins.
Here you have the authorizations.
And mom?
And Eulalia?
Give her your blessing, my dear Lord.
She was so good, the poor thing.
Before the Judge.
It's time, my friend.
Take your rags out of here now.
Unless you decide otherwise, baby.
There's still time!
Come and sit here. Forget the old man!
He doesn't see a thing, anyway!
That eviction cannot take place without proper expropriation.
These title deeds are genuine.
Let me go, you coward!
Silvestre arrives, and the criminal shoots his gun at him.
The lethal whistle.
The RUSCICO Company Presents a new project.
The first in national history films in a Science Fiction and Fantasy genre.
"AELITA" by Yakov Protazanov Based upon Alexei Tolstoy's novel of the same name.
The film is released after a frame-by-frame restoration of the image and with a new musical arrangement using the works of composers
Alexander Skryabin, Igor Stravinsky and Alexander Glazunov.
On December 4th 1921, at 18:27 European Standard Time, all the radio stations on Earth received a strange message.
Anta...
Odeli...
Uta...
In charge of the Moscow radio station was Engineer Los.
Pass it immediately to the Bureau of Deciphering.
At the Evacuation Center of the Kursky Railway Station.
Among the employees of the center was Natasha, Engineer Los' wife.
Red Army soldier Gusev arrived from the front for recuperation.
The Deciphering Bureau failed to make out the mysterious message.
- Couldn't it be a radio transmission from Mars to our scientists and inventors?
Los' close friend and colleague - Engineer Spiridonov.
Anything is possible!
Perhaps -- ...they on Mars got worried about you and I!
Come here, happy newlywed. Your wife is calling again.
I can leave early today. Come and meet me.
Uta... 18:27
All of Los' brain power and energy has been devoted to one task... -the trip to Mars, and in his imagination he often pictures...
Aelita the Queen.
Ihoshka, Aelita's favorite maidservant.
Tuskub the Ruler.
Gol, Radiant Energy Tower Guardian.
A model of the apparatus built by Gol for observing life on other planets.
It's a great discovery, but let it remain a secret... for everybody!
Show me other worlds...
No one will know about it.
All right...
In the evening I'll meet you at the tower of radiant energy...
Later... that evening...
Only to you, do I show life on a neighboring planet.
Time to go back.
Tuskub may come and see us.
Touch my lips with yours, like humans do... on Earth.
Spiridonov spent his evenings at his friend's place, working with him to build a spaceship to fly to Mars.
If only we could find a source of energy that would overcome Earth's gravity!
From the first day, Gusev had become the infirmary's favorite.
Nurse Masha
"Love me or not, honey!" "A soldier got no money!"
In 1921 the railways had no lack of passengers.
Comrade Erlich and his wife, Yelena
We don't provide quarters. Go to the women's section.
You're so...
What the cheek!
Viktor, I have the address of an old acquaintance...
Let's give it a try!
That day they were distributing food rations at the Evacuation Center.
I'm not angry... about the past, Yelena.
Introduce me to him as your brother.
White Bread...
Viktor Karlovich Erlich
Who's this character writing to you?
You're so charming that I cannot believe you would be so cruel to me...
You're jealous, aren't you?
The food Erlich brought made it possible to have a feast that was rare for Moscow, and remember "the beautiful past".
What the hell! It's sour, this wine!
I remember the wine we had before...
Oh ! Before, all human relationships were so sensitive, delicate...
Before we had order...
The days went on...
Los stubbornly continued his experiments.
After each failed experiment, Los went on dreaming...
Anta, Odeli, Uta
Excuse me! I'm the Chairman of the House Committee, I serve you notice.
You'll have to vacate your laboratory for a new tenant.
You know, we have met before.
This is Erlich, our new tenant.
At the Evacuation Center, people were actively preparing for a show.
Join us...
We're having such fun!
Yelena was successfully carrying out her husband's instructions.
On the day of the show, Natasha received a food ration at the club.
As a Soviet functionary, Erlich was doing fine.
To Mr. Pavlov - one sack of sugar.
I've brought sugar... We must hide it!
I told you we could pluck that goose.
The Evacuation Center's people decided to outdo the academic theaters.
Comrade Gusev is our chief assistant director.
The chocolate is real!
I have to go home. I got a lot of work.
At the distribution center, an unpleasant discovery was made.
The center's manager contacted the Chief of Criminal Investigation for help.
Investigate it and, if necessary, search Erlich's apartment.
I've got talent. By God, I've got it...
I'll prove it to you!
Citizen Kravtsov, I repeat again:
I am not hiring you.
I believe you're incompetent.
For the Indian ink, it was necessary to go to Spiridonov.
Got tired, comrade? I sympathize.
I sympathize with you very much.
I know everything...
I found it in your coat pocket...
You're lying. You're lying all the time!
The night seemed agonizingly long after that first quarrel.
Would you like to go to a Ball and have fun in spite of all the comrades?
To Engineer M.S. Los, The administration of Volkhovstroi thanks you for almost a year of dedicated work...
Kravtsov decided to investigate on his own the case of the lost sugar.
The meeting place of "Businessmen"...
All tickets are sold out. You'll make good money!
What a miser! In a whole week, just one medallion!
Each reminder of the mysterious radio transmission made his fantasy grow that much stronger.
For many days now Aelita was not permitted to see Earth...
Today is the meeting of the Elders.
No one will know if you go to the tower.
How dare you hide from me the apparatus built by Gol?
You're a queen, but we're the rulers.
The tower will remain closed.
So, by the decision of the Elders, a third of the living workforce is put into cold storage for keeping.
All the workers - the population toiling for the "Elders", never left their dungeons.
The first third to the cold storage!
The first third!
Are you avoiding me, Aelita?
Your thoughts are occupied with an Earthman...
I'll come out to you.
Martians were not alien to a feeling of jealousy...
You're in love with an Earthman.
You will never see him!
I'm leaving with you all the designs of my "interplanetonef".
Save them.
This is my lifes work.
Are you going alone?
How about Natasha?
Natasha was impatiently waiting for her husband...
Let's go to the Ball.
There'll be upper crust society there.
I'm sure your husband won't mind.
To spite him!
Anta, Odeli, Uta
Illegal Ball of the "select society".
The Ball's organizers talked Natasha into having supper with them.
I thought you were at the station seeing off your husband going on a trip.
My ravishing, my dear.
Stay for at least half an hour. Well, a quarter of an hour.
I have to leave today.
I regret I couldn't say goodbye to you.
I may be on this business trip for a long time.
Yours, L.
The only joy for Los was the realization that he, too, could take part in the great work of building the new Russia.
Slowly, yet inevitably, life was taking its normal course, and there was less and less work at the Evacuation Center...
Allow me to go and see off this torturer...
March 3, 1 922.
It's been over 2 months since your departure, and in this time you've sent me only 3 postcards.
If it's the end...
SOVIET Krasnopresnensky District
MARRIAGE REGISTRY OFFICE
With the Evacuation Center closed, Natasha went to work in a Kindergarten.
Los' business trip was coming to an end.
To Engineer M.S. Los.
The administration of "VOLKHOVSTROl" thanks you for your 6-month work.
It's been 2 months now since I left Russia... -for good.
I feel ashamed to admit it, but the ways and habits of the past proved stronger than I...
I hid your designs in the fireplace in your room, where... And the dream took hold of him again.
In his dreams Los disguises himself as Spiridonov.
It's strange... He hasn't showed up for two months, and today he appears as though he fell from another planet.
The new crime was promising new laurels for Kravtsov.
A suspicious character. We must find out who he is.
At one of the out-of-the-way outskirts of Moscow.
Kravtsov at his work.
Don't touch it!
By this glove I'll find the criminal.
The absence of foreign and home fronts, as well as the enforced inaction, burdened Gusev.
I can't do nothing!
I've established four republics, and now I'm going sour here...
Hot on the trail.
I'm arresting you on a charge of...
Do you have a warrant?
About the flight...
I'll go with my great pleasure!
Think it over, comrade. It's a lot of risk and very little profit...
The heights I'm reaching!
I'm flying to Mars tomorrow!
On the eve of the flight, the last workers were let to go home.
Next morning Moscow was celebrating one of the great Revolution days.
Where a good detective cannot ride, he will walk.
Five minutes before the flight.
- We're flying!
Engineer Spiridonov, you're under arrest for unauthorized return to the RSFSR and murder of Engineer Los' wife.
Some Pinkerton! Couldn't tell a false beard and a wig.
In that case... Engineer Los, you're under arrest for... Living under someone else's disguise.
This projectile is coming from Earth!
The observatory will fix the time and location of the projectile's fall.
The aliens from Earth must be destroyed.
You must not do harm to the aliens from Earth.
They'll be destroyed!
We won't let the plague of Earth invade Mars!
I know when and where the projectile landed.
The "Elders" did not leave, waiting for the Observatory's report.
Hurry to meet the guests from Earth and bring them to me.
The moment indicated by Chief Astronomer was nearing.
Comrades, are you from the militia?
A man here must be arrested.
May I introduce myself?
Commander Gusev from the Budyonny Cavalry.
Tuskub!
This is an Earthman!
Comrade Tuskubov, allow me, by my mandate, to arrest the criminal Los who arrived in your territory.
Touch my lips with yours, like you do it on Earth...
Do you recognize this necklace, Tuskub?
You're mine!
We'll be ruling over everybody here together!
Never! Never will I forgive myself for raising my hand against you!
Aelita, on the "Elders'" orders, this Earthman is under arrest.
The free speech of free men has won over the "Elders" thousand-year hypnosis.
Only you can help yourselves!
We had the same situation. Everything began with...
October 25, 1 91 7
...following our example, comrades, form one working family of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of Mars.
I'm with you! I will lead you!
I don't believe her... It's not for the masters to make revolutions!
You've got power.
Lay down your arms, you will never need them again on Mars.
The troops are on our side!
Open fire on the insurgents!
Drive them back to the dungeons!
I alone will reign and rule now!

Buy tires by ANTA... ODELI... UTA!
We're exposing the mysterious radio - it's our tires trademark.
We're going to the Far East Front. Our train will be in an hour.
And I've been dreaming again...
Half an hour ago I killed my wife...
But I'm not running away, no... I'll go back to her...
We can't leave the man like that. He may need help!
I was insane when I was shooting at you...
I'll be thanking providence all my life for having missed.
Do you still have any doubts?
No, I believe you...
Forgive me.
By the order of a court investigator, you're under arrest.
Enough of dreaming. A different, real work is awaiting all of us!

THE REASONS FOR THIS MEASURE
ARE
THE FAILINGS DUE TO YOUR AGE
The film could have finish thus
In the real life, the poor old man would not have had much to wait for but death.
But the screenwriter took him into pity, and imagined an almost incredible follow-up
The biblical quote "The last will be the first"
happened on this earth The blessed is...
AN EXTRAODINARY HERITAGE !
A short while ago, in the restrooms of the Atlantic-Hotel died the famous billionaire , Mr. Money, while whashing his hands.
Among the papers of this excentric has been found an extraodinary will making the sole heir of his huge fortune the person in whose arms he would die.
THE MARRIAGE CIRCLE
A few days... and a few nights... in Vienna still the city of laughter and light romance.
Dearest Mizzi. I've just learned that you moved to Vienna two months ago and I feel hurt that you didn't let me know.
I'm so anxious to see you again and have you meet my husband You and your husband must call soon...
Affectionately. Charlotte.
"Keep on with your cruelty...
"That's just what you want but you'll not ger rid of me so easily."
"I'm engaged and waiting for my passenger."
"If you're in a hurry, let me take you part of the way."
"Oh, sure... you look beautiful!"
Charlotte, whose marriage to Dr. Franz Braun is ideal.
Eduard Grieg "I LOVE THEE"
"You'll get over it...
"Mizzi, you can't imagine the perfect happiness of our married life!"
...I love thee more than any earthly creature...
"Don't be silly... husbands are blind!"
"Did you ever see a man like him!"
"I LOVE THEE"
"That's his favorite song."
"Professor, I never fail...
you're as good as divoced."
"Mrs. Stock has a fainting spell, and wants Dr. Braun to come at once!"
"I thought you were ill."
"It's my heart again."
"This is Dr. Braun... Charlotte's husband."
"I had another attack of my heart trouble."
"You must take good care of me."
Dr. Gustav Mueller calls at the Braun's every morning ostensibly for his partner, but really for a glimpse of his partner's wife.
"I've never seen you look so... so beautiful!"
"I might come to your office some day... when you are not expecting me."
My dear Mrs. Stock... I am convinced that I am not the right physician to treat your case so please consult another.
With best wishes for your speedy recovery, Sincerely, Franz Braun
DR. FRANZ BRAUN DR. GUSTAV MULLER PSYCHICIST SPECIALISTS
"Any one who talks so much can't be sick."
"Lucky Devil... to be so loved by your own wife!"
"I want to teach him not to throw my roses away."
"It's a very serious case."
"You see... how crazy my wife is about me?"
"I... er... a nervous man knocked it over."
"But I have many patients!"
"Gustav, you're my best friend.
Please... please console her."
With the first quarrel forgotten, the Brauns give a dinner party.
"We'll never quarrel again... never!"
"You seem greatly interested in Miss Hofer."
"Dr. Schmidt... friend of mine."
"I'm sorry, but I have important business at the club that will keep me there all night."
"He changed the place cards so he could sit by Miss Hofer but I put them back."
"Miss Hofer, I'm so glad to see you."
There is more danger in dancing than in dining.
"Get him Mizzi... dance with him... talk to him don't let him out of your sight!"
"Your dress!"
"I'm afraid you'll be cold!"
"Where's Franz?"
When a big party ends, small parties begin.
Slip out if you can.
I'll wait in the car at the corner for ten minutes. Mizzi Stock.
"Your behaviour with Pauline Hofer was simply... scandalous!"
"If you won't believe me... if you can't trust me then I can't stay here!"
"Dear, even if I am cross something I love you just the same."
"I merely wanted to prove how frightfully careless your husband is to leave you alone in the dead of the night"
"How can a husband, who loves his wife, neglect her so!"
"I love you... I just can't help it... nobody could!"
"Wait... I'm going back with you."
"Come upstairs... and phone for another taxi."
"Don't worry... he'll come back."
"You will not go back."
"I cannot live without you!"
"Prof. Stock has gone home."
"Josef!
I need love!"
"... I promised to tell Prof. Stock the result of the last chess game."
1:10am Dr. Braun and Mrs. Stock arrive in taxi and enter house.
1:15am A light is turned on in the room.
1:22am Shades are pulled down.
Remarks: When I left the house after 1:50am Dr. Braun was still there.
"Pack your things."
Then the morning, when one can't look the sun in the face.
"Get out and leave me in peace... or I'll tell my husband!"
"I had a terrible dream... Gustav was kissing me!"
"That's what happens... when you leave me alone."
"That is true... but I give you my word my visit was entirely innocent."
"I believe you... but nobody else will and I'm delighted to have a man of your standing help me get rid of my wife."
"By the way, Mizzi is at the Hotel Bristol... since this morning."
"Franz!
There's a man in this... but who?"
Franz:
...If you are not here by 10 o'clock I shall call at your office.
"Confide in me...
"My husband... and my best friend!"
"I'm innocent... I've done nothing...
Here is the proof!"
"Is it my fault that your husband fell in love with me?"
"I'll mail you a copy."
The dreaded end of a dreadful day.
"You must talk to Charlotte...
you are the only one in whom she has perfect confidence."
"Wait, Franz, my boy... I'll teach you a lesson so you'll never look at another woman."
"We had better go in the back way."
"Don't ask my forgiveness... I'm as guilty as you."
"Gustav's kiss was no dream... it was real in this room... in that very chair!"
"Tell me... didn't you return to this room last night?"
"And didn't we kiss each other?"
"Fifty-fifty."
Buster Keaton in The Navigator Directed by Donald Crisp and Buster Keaton
Our story deals with one of those queer tricks that Fate sometimes plays.
The spies of the two little nations were at a Pacific seaport, each trying to prevent the other getting ships and supplies.
"Gentlemen, the enemy have just purchased the steamship Navigator."
"There she lies now, and it is our patriotic duty to destroy that ship."
"We will send her adrift in the fog tonight before the new crew goes aboard. -
- The wind - the tide - and the rocks will do the rest."
The wealthy ship owner who has just sold the Navigator. (Actor : Fredrick Vroom)
And his daughter. (Actress : Kathryn Maguire)
Rollo Treadway - Heir to the Treadway fortune - a living proof that every family tree must have its sap. (Actor :
"I think I'll get married."
"Today."
"We'll sail for Honolulu tomorrow on our honey-moon - get two tickets."
"He had completed all arrangements - - except to notify the girl."
"Certainly not!"
"I think a long walk would do me good."
"Your tickets, sir - - and congratulations."
"The boat sails at ten in the morning, sir."
"I don't get up that early - so I'll go aboard tonight."
Going on a honeymoon without a bride is like singing the words of "Kiss Me Again" to the music of "Alice, Where Art Thou."
"Pier two."
"I must get some papers off the Navigator, so stop at Pier 12."
"Is there any one on board?"
"Nobody."
Under the cover of darkness the foreign agents prepared to carry out their plans.
The next morning found the Navigator drifting helplessly at sea.
"This is a fine time to ask me that.
I'm cold and hungry and - -"
"Put up that bright one."
"She's quarantined."
"Try and catch them!"
"Hey!
Wait a minute!"
By the time they were ready to say "good-night" they had found a couple of sea-going tuxedos.
Asleep in the Deep - Wilfred Glenn
Danger is near thee -
Many brave hearts are asleep in the Deep -
BEWARE
Weeks later - still drifting.
We now find the crew with a safe and quiet place to sleep.
"Land!"
"Cannibals!"
"We're safer on the boat."
"We're drifting toward them."
"We're safe!
I've anchored the ship."
"We are sinking!
It's just a matter of time until we're captured."
"Can't you fix it?"
"That would have to be fixed from the outside."

KRIEMHILD'S REVENGE
The First Canto:
How Kriemhild Mourned Siegfried, and How König Etzel (King Attila) Courted Her Through Rüdiger von Bechlarn.
King Gunther, Margrave Rüdiger von Bechlarn asks for an audience!
I come as ambassador to King Attila. He who is called the Lord of the Earth -
He who seeks the hand of your sister Kriemhild in marriage.
I am afraid King Attila knows not whom he woos.
In the name of Siegfried, who was murdered and whose murderer lives!
Keep in mind how Siegfried died!
Lord Attila sends me, O Queen, to ask for your hand on his behalf!
You seem to know quite well, Rüdiger, that I have been exposed to grievous wrongs in the house of my clan!
Brother! Where is your brother Siegfried?
Deliver unto me the murderer of my husband, O King!
He has remained loyal to me; so shall I remain loyal to him.
This, Kriemhild, is my final word!
Lady Kriemhild, Margrave Rüdiger, wishes to speak with you after evensong!
Now, Gerenot, is the time to keep close watch over Burgundy!
Speak to me of Lord Attila, Rüdiger!
You court a dead woman, Rüdiger!
He who murdered my husband flaunts the greensparkling sword that he stole from the dead man.
If ever you were done wrong at Attila's court, my lady, - Lord Attila would know how to avenge you!
Lord Margrave, swear this unto me in your and in King Attila's names!
Not on the cross, Lord Margrave, - on the sharp edge of your sword!
My lady!
Lord Hagen has stolen the Treasure!
You have my word, Lord Margrave Rüdiger!
Hagen Tronje, where is the Treasure?
Thus spake loyal Hagen:
Somewhere, my lady, where no-one might use the gold to forge arms against the kings of Burgundy!
Thus ends the First Canto.
The Second Canto:
How Kriemhild Fled Her Homeland, and How She Was Received by Lord Attila.
You have drunk Siegfried's blood, O Earth!
One day I shall drench you with Hagen Tronje's blood!
I shall return!
Rest assured, I shall return!
My daughter, shall you not proffer your hand in farewell to your brother Gunther?
No, mother.
You are heading far away, Lady Kriemhild. Don't you want to make peace with your family first?
No, my priest.
Don't you even once want to hail your people, my lady?
No, Rüdiger.
As Kriemhild approached, springtime blossomed in the land of the Huns.
That sack full of gold is mine! The queen is coming!
Meet her, brother!
Royal jewellery!
My lady, King Attila's brother, Blaodel, gives thee welcome!
Choose for yourself a kingdom from my lands, Rüdiger, in gratitude for this woman!
Ask King Attila, Margrave Rüdiger, whether he is prepared to make your oath his own!
Upon my oath, O Queen:
any man who insults you or does you wrong shall die a hundredfold death!
Thus ends the Second Canto.
The Third Canto:
How King Attila Besieged Rome and How Kriemhild Summoned Her Brothers.
Lord Attila swore he wanted to turn Rome's churches into stables for our horses!
Why does Lord Attila no longer uphold his oath?
We traipsed headlong into war!
Why don't we ride further onward?
Why is Lord Attila's horse tethered to his tent?
A great horseman was King Attila!
A mighty mare for him was the world!
Lord Attila whipped the world - his mare!
What does Lord Attila do now?
He sleeps!
He sleeps!
Lord Attila, Attila sleeps!
This white woman has stolen Attila from underneath our noses!
With her tresses does she bind up the horseman, The great horseman, Lord Attila!
My lord -!
Kriemhild...
Kriemhild has borne you a son!
O Earth... sacred Earth...
One wish, O Queen!
One wish that I might fulfill for you!
If you would honour me and make me happy, Lord Attila, then summon my brothers as guests to your court!
To Worms, Blaodel, to request as guests to our court the royal brothers of my wife!
Thus ends the Third Canto.
The Fourth Canto:
How Kriemhild Received Her Brothers.
For more than one moon's time your brothers stayed as guests of Rüdiger in the house of Bechlarn.
The minstrels sing a new song of the love between your brother Giselher and Rüdiger's only child, the beautiful Dietlind!
And so I bind in faith - Bechlarn and Burgundy:
one heart, one life, one death!
To honour your brothers, Lord Attila has sent the noblest of his knights - Dietrich von Bern - to greet them.
Once more, Nibelungen, before Lord Attila comes to greet you:
Forget not to whom Attila leads thee!
How could we forget, my lord, that we come to visit our sister Kriemhild?
Whoever wants to win my gratitude shall bear my sorrow in mind!
It was the day of the summer solstice, and the Nibelungen arrived at Attila's court.
King Attila, I now exhort you to your oath!
Siegfried's murderer is in your hands!
Think upon my sorrow!
Will you never forget Lord Siegfried, my lady?
Hagen Tronje shall fight me for his life!
You mustn't fight with the murderer, Attila! You must have the murderer killed!
Have our guest killed?
You swore to me, Attila!
On the life of your child: Make good upon your oath!
I hail from a desert land, O Queen.
If only one thing is sacred, it is a guest!
So long as Hagen Tronje regards the peace of my house, he shall be left in peace!
She spoke:
Whoever wants to win my gratitude shall bear my sorrow in mind!
Whoever brings me the head of Tronje, I shall fill his shield with gold!
But I beseech you:
do no harm to the sons of my mother!
Play on, bard!
Thus ends the Fourth Canto.
The Fifth Canto:
How the Huns Celebrated the Summer Solstice with the Nibelungen.
Is it the fashion at Worms upon the Rhine to sit at table armed from head to foot?
Lord Hagen Tronje knows why he never lays aside his sword!
Methinks that at such a feast the heir to all Attila's crowns mustn't be absent!
Methinks the boy will not live long.
Scarcely shall we as guests attend any court of his!
Treason!
The child!
The work of your guest, Lord Attila!
Now, Nibelungen, you are fair game!
I demand safe conduct from this hall for myself and my men!
Thus ends the Fifth Canto.
The Sixth Canto:
The Nibelungen's Distress.
Alert Lady Kriemhild of what it is you see!
Open the gate!
No Hun survives any longer in Attila's hall!
Avenge thy dead, Huns!
O Queen, it is impossible!
Avenge thy dead, Huns, and the royal child!
Sister!
Sister!
Consider your mother!
Hand over Siegfried's murderer - and you shall be free!
The fight is too uneven!
Not one of the Nibelungen will gaze upon this next dawn.
In Giselher does my own child die!
Stay out of it, Rüdiger!
Blood shall follow blood!
Get me Rüdiger!
The time is nigh, Lord Rüdiger! Make good upon your oath!
Lord Margrave Rüdiger, I demand from you Siegfried's murderer!
You do not send me against Hagen Tronje, - you send me against your brothers, my lady, who defend him with their very lives!
You've sworn an oath, Rüdiger!
You've sworn it upon the sharp edge of your sword!
I engaged my only child to Giselher!
Blood shall follow blood, Lord Rüdiger!
My lord!
Do not force me to kill my only child!
Thus ends the Sixth Canto.
The Seventh Canto:
The Nibelungen's End.
Lord Rüdiger stands before the gate!
He will bring us peace!
What do you bring us, father?
Death!
My lord, do not allow they who love one another to kill one another!
Tell them: They must deliver unto me the murderer of my child - and they are free!
You know not the German soul, Lord Attila!
The oath I made to Kriemhild is older than the oath between myself and you!
Don't force me to break my oath!
Do you wish me to lose my honour? !
- Defend yourself, Hagen Tronje!
O sister, what you have wrought!
Deliver Hagen unto me - and you are free!
Exalt in your revenge, Kriemhild!
Your younger brother is dead!
Rüdiger and his men are dead!
But Hagen Tronje lives on, who slew your Siegfried!
Hurl fire into the hall!
The Queen bids the hall be bombarded with fire arrows!
The palace is burning!
Lady Kriemhild is right, she is more than right!
I myself will stand at her side as the fire flushes the murderer Hagen from his hole!
You have my thanks, Kriemhild!
Although we were never united in love, we will, in the end, yet be united in hate!
Never, King Attila, was my heart so filled with love as now!
I don't want King Gunther of Burgundy to die a smoky death!
I shall offer Lady Kriemhild my head!
Speak, ye Nibelungen, will you buy your lives with Hagen Tronje's head? !
Loyalty, unbroken by iron, also will not melt in fire, Hagen Tronje!
Look! Volker prepares his fiddle for one final song!
I call it a shame and a disgrace, Lady Kriemhild, that you let these heroes whom you could not defeat in battle be annihilated in fiery distress!
Do you hear?
Lord Volker is singing!
O, that we were on the cool, green Rhine!
You are no human being, Lady Kriemhild -!
I died when Siegfried died...
An end -! An end -!
One vassal still lives, Lord Attila!
I cannot go home to my dead Siegfried before having atoned for every wrong...
Here is the sword, Lord Hagen.
Where is the Treasure?
I swore never to betray the location of the Treasure so long as one of my kings still lives!
Now, Kriemhild, no-one knows anything of the Treasure other than God and myself!
And God is no more discreet than I!
Now, Earth, drink your fill!
Deliver her home to Siegfried, her dead husband!
She belonged to no other man!
Here does the myth have an end.

Siegfried
Canto I
How Siegfried slayed the dragon
Thus spoke Mime, the artful blacksmith: "Siegfried, son of King Siegmund, ride home to Xanten.
Even I cannot teach you any more!"
Have you never before heard of the king's castle at Worms on the Rhine and the kings of Burgundy who reign there?
I shall go there to win Kriemhild!
Show me the way to Worms or you will lose your life!
Farewell, Siegfried, son of king Siegmund.
You will never get to Worms!
Young Siegfried understood the bird's song: If the dragon slayer would bathe in the dragon's blood, his body would become invincible, forever safe against sword and spear!
Here ends the first Canto
Canto II
Now Volker, the bard, sang of Siegfried in front of Kriemhild, and how Siegfried came to Worms.
The violin sounded and Volker sang:
The dragon slayer, the son of Siegmund entered the realm of the Nibelungen.
He won the fight against the dragon. There is no one on earth like him.
Thus spoke Alberich, the Nibelung: Spare my life and I will give you the wonder cap.
Whoever wears it becomes unseen or may take whatever form he chooses!
Spare my life, O hero, and I will make you the richest king on earth!
The crown of the King of the Northland, the ruler of the Ice giants is being wrought here by the Nibelungen.
No sword on earth compares with Balmung.
The Nibelungen forged it in fire of blood.
All is lost. Cursed be the heritage of the heir!
Return with me to stone all ye whom from stone were wrought.
The violin sounded and Volker sang: Siegfried became the dragon slayer The lord of the Nibelungen Treasure.
Twelve kingdoms subdued the powerful.
Twelve kings became his vassals.
Kriemhild, the daughter of Ute: "Volker, take this cloak, as reward for your song! I embroidered it myself.
Siegfried, son of King Sigmund, is outside the castle door with twelve of his knights, and asks for an audience with King Gunther.
Thus spake Hagen Tronje: King Gunther, let the dragon slayer go his ways, don't welcome him here!
No one shall say that at Worms one does not know the way kings greet each other!
Siegfried, son of King Siegmund, has my welcome!
I dreamt last night an awful dream...
And now this dream comes to my mind!
I come, King Gunther, to ask for your sister Kriemhild's hand.
King Gunther, too, has marriage plans.
He has set his heart on a bold and mighty maiden.
Her name is Brunhild and she is Queen of Iceland.
Ringed by fire, her invincible castle towers in the Northland.
Why must you speak of Brunhild?
You know she has set dangerous conditions: Thrice must the suitor best her in feats of strength or die!
Siegfried, the unique hero, has come to Worms at an opportune moment.
He may help us win Brunhild for you!
Twelve kings have I for vassals.
But vassal am I to no man, now and ever!
Prepare for the quest to get your bride, King Gunther.
It is Siegfried the mighty hero who will win Brunhild for you.
Here ends the second Canto.
Canto III:
How Siegfried won Brunhild for Gunther
The dragon ship is carrying foreign heroes to your shores!
The foreigners are nearing the flaming sea.
If he be strong enough and favored by the gods, the flames will consume themselves and die.
My maidens, help me put on my armor, this will be a a fight I've never fought before!
Welcome, hero, for the fight for life or death!
Neither life nor death do I desire from you, Brunhild.
It is King Gunther who woos you!
Before it is evening, King Gunther, your smothered weapons will adorn my hall.
Give me leave, King Gunther, to make ready your ship for your royal bride. We should set sail for home before sundown!
Let the triple battle begin, King Gunther!
You have to defeat me three times, o king: with the stone, the spring, and the spear.
Fear not, o king!
Make you the motions and my strength will win each contest. I'll throw the stone for you and carry you in the jump.
Here ends the third Canto
Canto IV
How Brunhild enters Worms and how the kings celebrated their wedding.
Start the prepartions for marriage!
The king's ship is arriving!
We have reached our destination, my queen!
Are you really the man who defeated me threefold?
I am your captive, but I shall never be your wife!
Keep your word, King Gunther, as I have kept mine!
If Kriemhild gives her consent, o hero, we shall celebrate a double wedding here today.
Since when is it customary among Burgundians to give the King's daughter in marriage to a vassal?
Siegfried is no vassal. I love him as though he were my brother.
We shall become blood brothers today!
Blood is mingling with red blood, the drops fuse inseparably.
Whoever forsakes loyalty to the bloodbrother will perish at the wayside, all honor is lost!
Brunhild has been defeated, not cowed.
Shall the king of Burgundy be scorned by an obstinate woman?
Damned be the deed half done!
Will you forsake your friend who gave you his own sister?
The magic cap will change you into what you wish.
Take Gunther's form and break Brunhild's iron will.
Here ends the fourth Canto
Canto V
How, after half a year, Siegfried's gift to his bride, the Nibelungen Treasure, arrives in Worms and how the two queens quarrel with each other.
O king, Burgundy's glory is waning, we need the Nibelungen treasure.
It would be folly to reject what Siegfried offers you as a brother and Kriemhild is worth more than all the gold in the world!
See what I found!
Put away the armlet, Kriemhild, it guards an ugly secret.
The Mistress of the Nibelungen Treasure has no need for it!
Listen, Kriemhild, at how I won the armlet - and keep silent!
The Nibelungen treasure has arrived!
How long, King Gunther, will Siegfried and Kriemhild tarry at the court of Burgundy?
They stay for the sake of my mother.
Would you, Brunhild, be willing to take up the daughter's place for Queen Ute?
Your brother's honor is entwined with this armlet.
It never should be seen again by human eyes!
It seems to me high time, King Gunther, that you send Siegfried back home to Xanten!
He shall leave of his own freewill!
I am going to attend mass, my daughter.
Follow me soon!
I'll go to the cathedral in the regalia of the queen of Burgundy!
The wife of a vassal may not precede the Queen of Burgundy!
How did you dare refer to Siegfried, my husband?
Siegfried introduced himself to me as Gunther's vassal and servant.
He did servant's work for my husband!
You, whom he disdained. You, whom he gave away. You dare to belittle Siegfried?
Make way for the Queen of Burgundy, vassal woman!
You recognize this armlet, you queen of Burgundy?
How came that armlet into your hand?
The carrier of the magic helmet who, disguised as Gunther, defeated you three times - Siegfried, my husband gave it to me!
King! Speaks your sister the truth?
Kill Siegfried!
Your babbling, hero, was worse than murder!
Siegfried is safe from your wrath.
None can slay the dragon slayer!
Save in one spot, where the linden leaf clung, is he vulnerable as other men!
King Gunther, let me deal with the dragon slayer!
We pledged blood brotherhood.
How can I be party to his death?
The one who took the armlet from me made me his wife, took my maidenhood from me!
Tronje, announce to the people of Burgundy that I invite everybody to a royal hunt to kill a mad dog and a ravening.
Here ends the fifth Canto.
Canto VI
How Gunther betrayed Siegfried.
Can you keep a secret Kriemhild?
I once broke the oath to be silent and never will do so again!
Well then, the upcoming hunt might easily turn into a chase for men.
A secret message warns me of war against Burgundy!
Good for you, Kriemhild, that your husband is the dragon slayer, the invincible!
Who warrants me that in the heat of battle not a chance blade should pierce where the lime leaf fell?
If you want me to protect him, I have to know the exact spot where the invicible could be hurt!
You are good counsel, you truest of true.
I shall mark the spot with a little cross myself!
I come to take leave, Brunhild.
We are starting for the hunt in the Odenwald forest.
Mind my vow, King Gunther, I shall not eat nor drink until my disgrace has been vindicated!
O my dear lord, don't leave me.
I dreamt last night a furious boar tore you to pieces!
I dreamt further that two mountains collapsed and buried you!
Today Gunther and I will reconcile.
Who else is my enemy?
Mother, I feel as if blood is draining from my heart!
The hunt in the Odenwald forest lasted from morning until sundown.
A handful of red gold for a cooling draught of white wine!
A wheel broke from the wagon loaded with wine.
But I know of a cool brook nearby!
I always heard of you as the fastest runner of all heroes, let's run, you and I, for the first draught!
Gunther, my brother, let's be friends again!
When you are back from the spring!
Grim Hagen spoke: The hunt is over!"
Here ends the sixth Canto.
Canto VII
How Kriemhild swears revenge to Hagen Tronje.
You may break your fast, Brumhild, Siegfried is dead.
Hail to you King Gunther!
For the sake of a woman's lie, you have slain your most loyal friend!
I call to you for justice, King Gunther!
Hagen Tronje has slain my husband!
Loyalty for loyalty, Kriemhild.
His deed is ours. His fate is ours.
Our breast is his shield.
You might try to hide among my clan, behind the altars of God, or at the end of the world - You cannot escape my vengeance, Hagen Tronje!
Announce to King Gunther, my brother, the Queen of Burgundy is dead!
Thus ends the tale of Siegfried.
THE CIGARETTE GIRL OF MOSSELPROM
This film was made in 1924 in Moscow by Mejrabpom-Rus studios
It is interesting because it's one of the first comedies dedicated to daily life in the USSR
The American MacBright, who is interested in Soviet Russia is en route for Moscow...
The secretary
Maria Ivanovna Rybtsova
(A. Dmokhovskaia).
The assistant book keeper
Nikodim Mityushin
(Igor llinski).
Don't torture me!
The assistant book keeper who awaits the judgement of destiny.
I'm not a man of the old Régime, however I don't hesitate to use the traditional style.
Yours, waiting, for the judgement of destiny, the accountant Nikodim Mityushin.
Time is precious for those who are busy.
Oliver MacBright
(M. Tsibulski).
Cameraman Latugin
(Nikolai Tsereteli).
The director Barsov-Aragonski
(A. Baratov) is always in edge before filming.
Waiting for a more suitable means of transport.
How kind of you to have waited for me.
Zina Vessenina
(Julia Solntseva)
Mosselprom
Excuse me, I'll be back in a moment.
In love with the pretty cigarette girl
Mityushin buys her goods from her, each day.
Silence!
Action!
When you've quite finished daydreaming, what about working the camera.
Mityushin carefully treasures all the cigarettes that he's bought.
I forgot that you smoke.
No, you see...
I mean to say, yes...
I only buy Mosselprom.
On the way from Mosselprom to Riga.
How long I've waited for this wonderful moment.
Latugin goes to the film lab.
to quickly develop the negative.
And so closes the day on which begins the adventures of our heros.
Your rushes are ready.
The studio head discusses a new script.
Why don't you give her a screen test?
Mityushin decides to use every means possible.
Would you like to be in the movies?
At the studio, filming was underway.
Equally "interested" in the movies,
MacBright arrives at the studio.
What a pleasure it is to see you again!
Here's the change from your American bank note.
Having obtained a part,
Zina immediately sets to work.
It's no good, I can't get it right.
Let's look at the scene together.
Mityushin can't wait for his day's work to come to an end.
In half an hour,
Zina was so confident in her abilities that...
I'm leaving:
I'm going to become an actress.
There was something medieval, chivalrous and classical in the stubborness of Mityushin.
Can you help me... you see there's usually a pretty brunette here, who sells cigarettes.
The weather isn't always on the side of those in love.
Even at work, there are moments of idleness.
A man in two minds.
Congratulate us, we're engaged.
I didn't want you cast in the first place...
I told you I didn't have any talent...
It's all over.
Idiot, it's just a trick for the camera.
Now you've gone and spoilt the filming.
I don't want any reward:
In saving you, I saved my love.
Excuse me... but why aren't you wet?
Could you show me your profile please.
Wonderful!
You'd be a sensation on the big screen, and I hope we'll see one another soon.
They haven't even been opened...
To Oliver MacBright, Due Russian English Agreements.
The interest life Soviet Russia constantly growing.
Order promptly Russian films.
From her...
Oh...
I must ask you to leave and not disturb our work.
Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
I can't work with Latugin anymore.
Give me another cameraman.
I'm going to give you another job.
We've been asked to make a film on the daily life of the New Moscow.
They've taken me off the film.
Mister MacBright thinks that with your face and your figure, you could easily earn a fortune.
The Forgotten Flower
7 acts 17 acts
Latugin busies himself in his new job.
Do you think you could give me the allure of a poet.
You know, it's terribly difficult to reconcile the creative abilities of the writer with the trivialities of the balance sheet.
This damn scene. If I could only rehearse it.
Down on your knees, wretch!
I am merciless.
You can consider yourself free from all your obligations to us.
Latugin hurries to finish his film.
This bit isn't necessary, you can take it out.
Huh, he's jumbled everything up and then left.
Good Lord, what gibberish.
Head of Studios
A Filmic Tragedy in 17 acts
Dedicated to a very talented young actress:
Zinaida Vessenina
Today brings the screening of the film commissioned by MacBright.
Please, could you hire this man:
Mister MacBright repeats again that with your face and your figure, you could easily earn a fortune.
Daily life in the New Moscow by A. Latugin.
The "busy" streets of Moscow.
The care shown to children.
Summer, Moscow covered in flowers.
Moscow's picturesque surroundings.
The new monuments:
The statue of Dostoevsky.
They're making fun of us.
Instead of showing us everyday life in the new Moscow, they're showing us this woman. that the cameraman Latugin has fallen in love with.
But it's a special genre:
the travelogue.
This won't do.
You're both fired.
It's all your fault...
Dear Mr. MacBright, after thinking over your offer,
I have come to the conclusion that for a poor, young woman like myself, scrupules are a luxury.
Zina Vessenina.
The work of MacBright's new secretary consists of translating his correspondance.
Dear Mr. MacBright, After thinking over your offer,
I have come to the conclusion that:
for a poor, young woman like myself, scrupules are a luxury.
Please will you forgive me.
The cause of all this is my love for you.
Can you really blame me?
What a disgusting hypocrite!
And she's written to the American for an interview.
Get away from me you venal creature...
I can explain everything.
Life's long road continues on its way.
If one's not working in the movies, being a street photographer isn't such a bad way of life
Keep still.
Mister MacBright suggests that you forget you're an actress, and asks you not to make a scene.
Office of Oliver MacBright:
Appartment nº3
They've killed Zina!
They've just taken the trunk to the station.
Open that trunk. There's a body inside.
It wasn't worth the bother of bringing all those mannequins,
Moscow has its own models.
They've taken the trunk.
Huh!
A fine detective, you'd make.
How could you even think that the representative of a foreign prêt-à-porter company would want to kill his own models?
You've ruined my whole life, you and your imbecilic love.
Tell Mr. MacBright that I don't wish to work for him any more.
My life is in tatters!
Why are you so heartless. Do you want to spoil everything about our love?
You probably don't love me, or even know what love is!
Why did you seduce me?
Why, force me to love you?
You probably don't know how much it hurts, my broken heart.
Mr. Mityushin, I require you to do me a great service.
I would be extremely grateful if you would present yourself immediately at my residence.
Oliver MacBright.
I need your skills as a translator in a rather delicate matter. It is of very great importance for me
You will receive 100 dollars, and if everything goes according to plan, 1,000 more.
The important but delicate concern of Oliver MacBright...
Please, could you tell Miss Zina that I am asking for her hand in marriage.
I am flattered, but I'm not ready for marriage.
Oh, joy of joys.
She refused him.
Tell her that what I shall treasure most on my long journey home are the fondest memories of her.
D'you know what he said?
"It's her who seduced me because she was only after my money, and I've seen through her little game".
Any mail for Mr. MacBright should be forwarded to:

A street in Bagdad, dream city of the ancient East...
If it be his purse, let him tell what is in it.
'Tis empty.
The magic basket...
The magic rope of Ispahán woven from a witch's hair in the caverns of the Jinn.
Come to prayer! Come to prayer!
O true believers, gathered in this sacred mosque, earn thy happiness in the name of the true God...
Toil... for by toil the sweets ...of human life are found
What I want - I take.
My reward is here.
Paradise is a fool's dream and Allah is a myth.
Honest citizens of Bagdad, ...here is a thief to be flogged.
Four and twenty lashes for the stealing of this jewel.
Alms! O ye merciful!
Alms!
Rouse yourself, bird of evil.
It is a magic rope.
With it we can scale the highest walls.
In far eastern Asia, a Mongol Prince in his Palace at Ho Sho...
The Palace of the Caliph of Bagdad.
It shall be mine.
Celestial Majesty, at the next moon, ...suitors do go to Bagdad, ...seeking in marriage its royal Princess.
The gods of our dynasty direct us.
We shall enter Bagdad as a suitor.
Open wide the gates of Bagdad!
We be porters bound for the Palace of the Caliph.
We bear gifts and viands to feast the suitors who, on the tomorrow,
Tonight - with the magic rope.
Beasts and scimitars guard the Palace.
When night reaches its noon...
The Princess sleeps.
The treasure-where is it?
'This here-
The melody of the oriental night dies in the dawn.
And it is morning-.
It is the birthday of our Princess... and royal suitors come from all the East to seek her hand in marriage.
On the balcony of the Princess, a slave girl reads a fortune-
The sands of Mecca shape a rose.
This is the meaning: Thou wilt wed the suitor who first toucheth the rose-tree in thy garden.
'This here-
Nizzy noodle!
He's turned love-bird.
She is a rare jewel, my love-bird.
Something beyond your reach, you prince of thieves.
Yet- once upon a time- a Princesa was stolen from a Palace... under the very eye of Harun-al-Rashid.
They found a way into the Palace and, with a subtle drug, they drowsed her and carrier her away.
The suitors are at the Palace gates.
The Prince of the Indies whose palace is covered with an hundred thousand rubies.
He glowers.
I like him not - with all his rubies.
Allah grant he touch not the rose-tree.
He touched not the rose-tree.
In the bazaars of the sleepy merchants, thy nimble fingers can procure us princely raiment.
The Prince of Persia whose fathers fought at Feyjoo five hundred years ago.
He's fat and gross as if he fed on lard.
Praise Allah!
He touched not the rose-tree.
The bazaars of the merchants...
Cham Shang the Great, Prince of Mongols, King of Ho Sho Governor of Wah Hoo and the Island of Wak.
Bagdad is a mighty city.
Fail I to win the Princess, it shall be mine by strategy.
O horrible!
He chills my blood with fear!
Ahmed, Prince of the Isles, of the Seas, and of the Seven Palaces.
Ahmed, Prince of the Isles, of the Seas, and of the Seven Palaces.
See how he rides - a Prince indeed!
'This he would make me happy.
Allah guide him to touch the rose.
There's no such rank nor title.
Celestial Majesty, the superstition of the Princess centers on that rose-tree.
How tragic, O Prince, if you had been killed and an end put to your illustrious family.
We must make haste to steal her.
Prince of the Isles and the Seas.
Allah foretold thee with a rose.
We must away from here.
The Caliph awaits the suitors.
To possess Bagdad I have now a two-fold reason.
In the Throne Room....

The Just One, the Holy, the High-Born...
The Princess, according to ancient custom of our House hath made her choice.
Let her ring be placed upon the hand of the chosen.
He has not wed her yet.
My daughter's choice and heir to the throne of Bagdad.
The word is said. If any have protest, voice it now.
When the moon tips the cypress the betrothal will be consummate in feast. Come.
He is the thief who yesternight did rob the Palace.
Desecration most foul, O mighty Caliph, hath been wrought upon thy noble House!
This Ahmed is but a common thief.
This Ahmed who calls himself a Prince, hunt him down!
I am not a Prince.
I am less than the slave who serves you.. a wretched outcast... a thief.
What i wanted, I took.
I wanted you... I tried to take you...
But, when I held you in my arms... the very world did change.
The evil in me died.
I can bear a thousand tortures, endure a thousand deaths... but not thy tears.
This Arab Prince is but a thief.
Quick! Hide thyself.
If thou art found with me, they will be merciless.
Thou dog!
What torments can we devise for thee!
Flog him!
Fling him to the ape! Let him be torn to pieces.
A pearl to every guard.
She shall choose again.
The secret panel into the streets...
Choose! I command you.
I myself will make the choice.
Betray not the sands of Mecca. Gain time. Defer the outcome.
Send them to distant lands to seek some rare treasure.
At the seventh moon let them return.
When marriage plans have gone amiss, The seventh moon betokens bliss.
Morning...
Come, if you still wouldst steal her.
I have found a way through the tunnels of the tigers.
The Princes will return at the seventh moon bearing treasure.
The one who brings the rarest wins the Princess.
Lose not thy hope, the rose persists, and something good will come of this.
Turned lily-white he now goes mewling to the mosque.
Thou art wounded.
In heart and soul.
I love a Princess.
Make thyself a Prince.
Allah hath made thy soul to yearn for happiness but thou must earn it.
Stay you in Bagdad.
I will send soldiers under guise of porters bearing gifts.
Build me an army within the walls.
And so.. on the bedrock of humility thou canst build any structure.
Come with me and I will set thy feet on the path that leads to treasure beyond thy dreams.
Three suitors leave thy city gate But four are numbered in her fate.
At the end of the way is a silver chest that doth contain the greatest magic. Thou must be brave.
Go now. Control thy destiny.
Give this to her who hath already my heart.
A day's journey from Bagdad... a caravansary in the desert...
Thus far the three Princes have traveled in company.
Great Lords of Asia, good fortune to you second only to mine own!
Let us meet here at the end of the sixth moon.
Set spies to follow each.
A Defile in the Mountains of Dread Adventure...
The Hermit of the Defile.
I seek a magic chest that lies beyond this defile.
Knowest thou, rash youth... devouring flames, ...foul monsters, shapes of death beset the path?
A hundred years have I been here.
Many have gone this way and none returned.
But, if thy resolve be firm, I will help thee.
If thou dost reach the Cavern of Enchanted Trees touch with this talisman the midmost tree.
In Bagdad, the pavilion of the Princess...
He too may return by the seventh moon.
... but his road is hard.
You must pray for him.
The first moon.
The Valley of Fire...
The second moon.
In search of rare treasure, The Persian Prince came to the bazaars of Shiraz.
A crippled beggar knew a priceless secret.
The magic carpet.
They know not its value.
My Prince, here is the greatest rarity in the world, ...the flying carpet.
The third moon.
The Valley of the Monsters.
The Cavern of the Enchanted Trees.
Thou hast shown great courage but thy way is yet hard.
This is the chart to guide thee to the Old Man of the Midnight Sea.
The fourth moon.
In search of rare treasure, the Prince of the Indies came to a forgotten idol near Kandahar.
This is the greatest rarity in the world, the magic crystal.
The fifth moon.
The Old Man of the Midnight Sea.
At the bottom of the sea is an iron-bound box.
Now you must climb to the Abode of the Winged Horse.
That star-shaped key will give you entrance here.
The Abode of the Winged Horse...
The sixth moon.
In search of rare treasure, the Prince of the Mongols came to the Island of Wak.
A court magician knew a secret shrine.
The magic apple...
That fisherman.
Far rarer than India's crystal or Persia's carpet.
Thou wilt haste to Bagdad and, at the end of this sixth moon, give order that the Prince be poisoned.
The Citadel of the Moon...
The magic chest is wrapped in a cloak of invisibility.
The Cloak of Invisibility and the Magic Chest...
At the end of the sixth moon...
A day's journey from Bagdad..
Let us haste to Bagdad.
O Prince of the Indies, discover this with the crystal.
...Does the Princess wait as she pledged?
Spread the flying carpet.
With the magic apple we shall save her life.
The learned doctor, Zakariya of Kufa.
I was at the portals of death and now I glow with health.
...What miracle is this?
I was I who brought you back.
By the beard of the Prophet, it is rarest.
Her life belongs to me.
¡To me! To me!
It is for me to decide which gift is rarest.
A moment, O Princes!
...Without the apple you could not have cured me. Apple.. crystal.. carpet.
Bagdad is in the hands of the Mongols.
Open wide the gates of Bagdad!

Part one.
"MEN AND MAGGOTS."
The spirit of revolution soared over the Russian land.
A tremendous, mysterious process was taking place in countless hearts.
The individual personality, having hardly had time to become conscious of itself... dissolved in the mass, and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary élan.
Sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk.
We, the sailors of Potemkin, must support the workers, our brothers... and stand among the front lines of the revolution!
Heavy and gloomy is the sleep of the off duty.
Attentive, but clumsy.
He vents his anger on a young man.
Hurtful...
Vakulinchuk
The time has come when we too must speak out.
Why wait? All of Russia has risen! Are we to be the last?
Morning.
We've had enough rotten meat!
Even a dog wouldn't eat this!
The ship doctor Smirnov.
It could crawl overboard on its own!
These aren't worms.
They are dead fly larvae.
You can wash them off with brine!
Russian prisoners in Japan are fed better than we are!
It's good meat.
End of discussion!
Senior Officer Giliarovsky
Impotent rage was overflowing.
The ship's store.
The sailors refused to eat the borscht.
GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD
Part two. "DRAMA ON THE DECK."
Commander Golikov
Whoever is satisfied with the borscht take two steps forward!
The petty officers.
You're free to go!
I'll hang the rest on the yard!
Call the guards!
Matyushenko, under the guise of breaking ranks, calls the sailors to the gun turret.
To the turret...
To the turret!
Guys! ...
It's time.
Most of them gathered by the turret.
They try to sneak through the admiral's hatch.
Back, scoundrels!
That way is not for you!
I'll shoot you all like dogs!
Cover them with canvas!
Got it!
Make the disobedient see reason!
Fire right into the canvas!
Vakulinchuk decides.
BROTHERS!
Who are you shooting at? !
The rifles quavered.
Everyone shoot!
Shoot, scum!
To the rifles, brothers!
Smash the dragons! Smash 'em!
Smash 'em all!
Have fear of God!
Beat it, sorcerer!
To the bottom to feed the worms!
Brothers! We've won!
The bleeding Vakulinchuk flees from the furious Giliarovsky.
Vakulinchuk's overboard!
Save Vakulinchuk!
And he who was first to sound the cry of rebellion was first to fall at the executioner's hand.
To the shore.
A tent on the new pier in Odessa is the final resting place for Vakulinchuk.
FOR A SPOONFUL OF BORSCHT
Part three. "THE DEAD MAN CALLS OUT."
Mist lingered on from the night...
Rumours came from the pier.
Together with the sun, the news hit the city.
The battleship raided rebellion shore... A killed sailor...
For a spoonful of borscht.
"Citizens of Odessa!
Lying before you is the body of the brutally killed sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk... killed by a senior officer of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky.
Let's take revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires!
Death to the oppressors! Signed:
Crew of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky."
Eternal memory to the fallen fighters!
One for all.
Down with the executioners!
Down with tyranny!
Mothers and brothers! Let there not be differences or hostility among us!
Smash the Jews!
Shoulder to shoulder.
Tomorrow is ours.
A delegate from shore.
The enemy must be dealt a decisive blow!
Together with the rebelling workers from all of Russia WE WILL WIN!
The shore watched Potemkin tensely and attentively.
Part four. "THE ODESSA STAIRCASE."
In those memorable days, the city lived together with the rebellious battleship.
Like a white-winged flock, boats flew to the battleship.
AND SUDDENLY
Let's go! Let's convince them!
Listen!
My boy is badly hurt.
COSSACKS!
And then the brutality of the military authorities in Odessa was answered with the battleship's shells.
The target— the Odessa theater.
The generals' headquarters.
Part five. "RENDEZVOUS WITH THE SQUADRON."
Turbulent meetings went on until evening.
The people of Odessa are waiting for the liberators!
Land the troops and the army will join you.
Landing is not possible.
The admiral's squadron is coming our way.
With one heart, they decided to face the squadron.
Night came, full of anxiety.
The squadron was sneaking up in the darkness.
Sore from constant speech, throats breathe heavily and unevenly.
Squadron on the horizon!
Prepare for battle!
Full speed!
Hearts forward!
Top speed!
Potemkin and destroyer No. 267.
The admiral attacks!
The squadron draws near!
Give the signal: join us!
Join! ... ...us!
The enemy is within firing range!
All against one.
ONE AGAINST ALL.
... or...
Above the heads of the tsar's admirals thundered a brotherly hurrah.
And proudly waving the red flag of victory, without a single shot, the rebellious battleship passed through the rows of the squadron.

FRESHMAN
Do you remember those boyhood days when going to college was greater than going to congress and you'd rather be Right Tackle than President?
The home of Harold Lamb.
His father was the best bookkeeper in the county ... and the worst liar in the state.
"Look, Pa, how much Harold has saved to take to college for spending money, just by selling washing machines. "

"I've got China !"
"I guess he learned it at that movie show, "The College Hero" he saw it six times yesterday. "

Harold Lamb Voted the Most Popular Man in College Our Football Captain 1925
"I saw it in the movies, the college hero did that jig every time ... he was introduced to anyone. "
"I took me a week to learn it, Dad ... but I bet it will make a hit at college !"
"I'm afraid, Ma, if Harold imitates that movie actor ... at college, they'll break either his heart or his neck !"
The Opening of the Fall term at Tate University a large football stadium with a college attached.
The Dean of the College ... he was so dignified he never married for fear ... his wife would call him by his first name.
The peril of the Freshman ... an upper class bully who made Simon Legree ... look like the Good Samaritan .
On the Tate Limited.
Peggy, ... the kind of girl your mother most have been.
"Hello, Peggy ... are you still helping your mother with the boarding house ? "
"Yes ... and I have a new job at the Hotel Tate in the check room. "
"I think I know the word for number 19 vertical 'a name for the one you love love.' "
"Sweetheart."
"Darling."
"Dearest."
"Precious."
"Honeybunch."
"Isn't it wonderful to be in love ?"
"Pipe the latest sport-model Freshman with the old fashioned trimmings, let's ride him !"
"My name's Harold Lamb ... what's yours ?"
"I am the Dean of this college."
"Have you been assigned a car to take you to the college ?"
The Tate Auditorium.
The student body was waiting to be annoyed by the Dean's opening address.
"See that everything is ready ...
the Dean is due any minute. "
TATE AUDITORIUM STAGE ENTRANCE
"Aren't you going to say a few words of greeting to the students ?"
"Why, every new student must make a speech ... if you don't, you'll be the most unpopular man in college !"
"My friends, I am here ...er... yes, there is no doubt but that I am here ... ... "
"Yes, I repeat that I am here ... er...you are here in fact, we are all here ."
NOTE FROM THE COLLEGE HERO
"I'M JUST A REGULAR FELLOW STEP RIGHT UP AND CALL ME SPEEDY "
"I'm just a regular fellow !"
"... and I want you to step right up and call me 'Speedy' !"
"Come on... I'll stand treat for some ice cream !"
A day spent in spending changed Harold's plans for living quarters ...
FOR RENT FURNISHED ROOM 3$ PER WEEK.
"I'll spend my daughter up to finish washing these windows while you're out to to dinner ."
"I ...er... took this little room so I'd have a quiet place ... to hide away and study ."
As "Speedy" splurged through the dizzy days, ...even the Tate Tattler ast up and took notice ...
This Frisky Freshman is Just a Regular Fellow, ...Who is Leaving a Trail of Empty Ice Cream Cones on his Dizzy Dash to Popularity.
"You see, you can never be as popular as Chet Trask unless you play on the football team ."
Football practice ...
Where men are men and necks are nothing.
The head coach ... so tough he shaves with a blow-torch.
"The boys are getting careless I'll have to jack 'em up. Get them together and I'll tear 'em to pieces !"
"What this team needs is the fighting spirit !
... ...You dubs are dead from your dandruff down !"
"There's the only man on your team with the real Tate spirit !"
"There's the man to model yourselves after !
He's worth more than the whole bunch of you put together !"
"He's a regular go-getter a red-blooded fighter the kind of man that Tate is proud of !"
"You're all afraid of getting hurt !
... ...I'd like someone to show me a real ROUGH tackle !"
"I'd like to play on your football team if you don't mind."
"Can you kick a football ?"
MIKE MASCOT
"Get off this field ... AND DONO'T COME BACK !"
"The boys need tackling practice more than anything else we've GOT to have a dummy !"
"This is no Petting party !
... ...That's not half hard enough !"
"Never tackle a man this way !
You might get hurt !"
"You see... that didn't hurt me a bit ."
"And besides, if you tackle high, they'll get you with the straight arm now, watch me !"
"You see, that's not the way to do it ."
"Now, I'll show you the right way to do it."
"You guys are weaing me out !
... ...This team is going to learn to tackle if it takes all night !"
"We had a great work-out, didn't we, Coach ?"
"That kid's got a great spirit I hate to tell him he can't make the team. "
"Why not keep him on the squad as a water boy and let him think he's one of the substitutes? "
THE WHITE COMPANY AMBULANCE
"I've got a new one on Speedy he thinks he made the football team and he's only the water boy !"
"Harold Lamb has more spunk in his little finger than you have in your whole conceited make-up !"
"Harold, I've something to tell you ..."
"I MADE THE TEAM !"
"I... I congratulate you."
And so in Speedy's fancy, Chet Trask was tottering on his throne ...
The Tattler wonders who will step forward this year to be our host at the customary Fall Frolic.
It will be remembered that the host of last year's gala event was Chet Trask, who was later voted ... the most popular man in college.
Harold (Speedy) Lamb requests the pleasure of your presence at his Fall Frolic October 25, 1924 at the Hotel Tate
The host -- how he hoped to look for $38.50
"It 's one of his dizzy spells, Mr Lamb a little brandy always fixes him right up."
"There's no danger of not having my suit ready for the party, is there ?"
The Fall Frolic
The crowning achievement of Speedy the Spender.
"It's after ten o'clock... I wonder what's keeping Speedy."
"With the whole college waiting, you pick out a day like this for dizzy spells !"
"I only had time to baste it ... so be careful it's just loosely sitched together."
"Easy ... EASY ... EASY !
... I'd better go with you in case anything happens !"
"All hail ... our host !"
"If anything rips, I'll ring this bell."
"Speedy, old pal, can you let me have ten dollars ?"
"I'd be all right if I could only get a little drink. "
"Just for that, you little fool, I'm going to tell you what this bunch really thinks of you !"
"You think you're a regular fellow ...why, you're nothing but the college boob !"
"Ever since you came to college,... we've just been kidding you... look ...."
"I'm just a regular fellow step right up and call me Speedy !"
"It doesn't bother me a bit really; a fellow has to expect those things, you know."
"For he's a jolly good fellow !"
"Harold, you haven't been true to yourself you've been pretending to be what you though they wanted you to be."
get out and make theme like you for what you really are and what you can do !"
"There's just one chance left if I ever get in that big game against Union State, I'll show them !"
The day of days!
When every heart in Tate stood still and all the world watched football history in the making.
"Look at Speedy on the bench he still thinks he has a chance to get in the game !"
QUARTER: 4TH MINUTES TO PLAY: 14
"I'm afraid Union State is too heavy for our boys... they've knocked out almost the whole Tate team."
"Quick, see if any of the boys who were hurt can get back in the game I have only one substitute left !"
"There's only two of us left, old boy !
... ...we'll get into this game yet !"
"Wait... I'll get Speedy to change sweaters with you."
"Hard luck, Dave, old fellow !
... ...They're sending me in ahead of you !"
"Take off your sweater and give it to Miller ."
"There's only ten minutes to go...
I won't quit now, I tell you... I won't !"
"Why, we've just been kidding you ...you're only the water boy."
"You listen, now ! I wasn't kidding !
I've been working...and fighting just for this chance... and you've got to give it to me !"
"You've had enough time out, send in your substitute !"
"You have one minute to send in a substitute or else forfeit the game !"
"Come on, you old women !
... ...Are you afraid of mussing your hair?
...Don't you know how to fight ?"
"Atta boy, Speedy...
a twenty yard again !"
"When you hear this whistle, put that ball down !"
"They may kick ... I better play back...
hey ?"
"Two minutes to go!"
"One minute left to play ... and you've thrown away our last chance !"
"I can't look !
Is it over the line ?"
I knew you could do it I'm so proud ... and I love you ...

Some people travel through life making friends where ever they go, while others -
Just travel through life.
In a little town in Indiana, the social standing of a certain young man had kept him continuously on the move.
"I'll give you a dollar sixty five for the whole business."
"I've tried every place in town for a job, do you suppose there's any use asking you?"
Brown Eyes.
"Do you need any cowboys today?"
"I'm working here."
"You don't seem to be."
"Tell that new hand to get a horse and go help the boys."
"I'm shipping a thousand head, Thursday.
"Get those steers back in there."
"Wave something red and they'll come to you."
"Get a brand on that cow."
The day of the shipment.
"What do you mean by selling cattle now, when you know I am holding out for a higher price?"
"That's my business."
"You'll not ship cattle out of this country if I can stop it."
"He threatens to stop the cattle. -
- And if they don't reach the stockyards, I'm ruined."
"Put her in there, she goes too."
"Where?"
"To the slaughter-house."
"She's not going!"
"You can't buy her, she'll bring twice that much."
"Why don't you let him have her."
"You boys see that the train gets through."

"Call out the Fire Department to help stop the stampede."

Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier to the gold fields.
Over this Pass men faced untold misery and hardship.
Many lost their lives. Some fell by the wayside, others lost courage and turned back.
But the brave went on.
Far into the icy north, deep into the silent nowhere, came an undaunted lone prospector.
And somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector.
With cheerful optimism our little Columbus descended, then stopped, stepped, slipped and slid.
"Now let me see," thought the little fellow.
"Before I know where I am, I must get there."
There in that frozen wilderness a dream came true, and a lone voice shrieked into the solemn sky,
"Eureka!
I've found it, a mountain of gold!"
But the elements laughed, roared and thundered.
In that raging nowhere was a lone cabin, and another lone man, Black Larson, an unmitigated, predatory scoundrel.
Out of the lashing storm came the Little Fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality.
There he sat, resting his weary bones as the icy wind howled through the knothole.
"Come here," said Larson.
"What are you doing?"
"Eating, obviously."
"Get out."
"Go on!"
"Get out!"
The wind also was giving Big Jim his troubles.
Big Jim was the noble type.
He had suffered.
Oh, how he loved to suffer.
He suffered about everything.
"Get out," said Black Larson.
"Or I'll fill you both full of lead."
"Now then, the pair of you, get out!"
"Out!"
That kind of noise Jim don't tolerate.
"I'll stay right here, understand?"
"Right here," said Big Jim.
"Yes, sir, he'll stay right here," said the Little Fellow.
"Understand?
We stay right here."
And stay they did, for days and nights.
The cabin moaned and groaned.
Two men walked and never talked, hunger gnawed their bones.
"I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.
"I must have food!"
"What are you eating?" said Black Larson.
"Nothing."
"Open your mouth!"
"Liar!
It's that candle."
"That?" said the Little Fellow.
"How revolting."
"If I thought you were holding out on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"
"One of us must brave that storm, if we're to get food."
"Come here, the pair of you."
"We'll cut the cards and the low man goes."
"You're the man," said Jim.
"Goodbye, good luck."
"Don't forget to bring home the bacon."
Somewhere in that nowhere, the law was looking for Black Larson.
Desperate with hunger and here it was Thanksgiving Day.
Nevertheless there was something to be thankful for.
"Not quite done yet, give it two more minutes."
"Come on, come on," said Big Jim.
After scouring the country for food, the Little Fellow had to admit he had seen nothing, not even a field mouse.
From the pangs of hunger, Big Jim was becoming delirious, hysterical.
In fact he was a pain in the neck.
"Food, food!" he thundered.
"I can put another shoe in the pot."
"No, no, anything but that!"
Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.
"What's the matter?" said the Little Fellow.
"I thought you were a chicken."
"Well, build up the fire," said Big Jim.
"What's the matter with you?" said the Little Fellow.
"Come, my pretty bird," said Big Jim.
"Don't be childish."
"Hey, quit it. Don't be foolish, it's me!"
"You!" said Jim.
"I'm sorry. I must be crazy."
"You're telling me," said the Little Fellow.
"You go inside. I'll take the gun in case you lose it."
Chicken or no chicken, the Little Fellow looks appetizing to Big Jim.
Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.
Then came the parting of the ways,
Big Jim to his mine, our hero to his fate.
"Goodbye," said the Little Fellow.
"It's been a great pleasure knowing you."
Treachery awaited Big Jim at his mountain of gold.
Big Jim looked deep into the eyes of Black Larson and saw there the soul of a skunk.
Caught in a maelstrom of desperate deeds,
Black Larson swept on to impending doom.
And out of a dream in that frozen waste, a city grew. And humanity warmed it with living, loving and desiring.
Jack was a ladies' man.
Georgia was quick and impulsive, proud and independent.
In the evening Georgia worked as a dancehall girl.
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia. Perhaps that's why she resented him.
Out of the night came the Little Fellow, towards the dancehall, that beacon light of pleasure, that retreat of lost dreams.
"Georgia, why aren't you nice to Jack?"
"I believe he really likes you," said the girl.
"He likes everybody," said Georgia quite audibly.
"I'm bored with this place," she continued.
"I'd give it all up if I could find someone honest and worthwhile."
"Don't worry, I'll find him someday."
Then she turned and looked and looked and looked.
"Kinda fresh, ain't ya?" thought Jack.
"Get down off that high horse."
"Me and you are gonna dance."
"Hey there, pan out a tune."
"Just a moment, I said we're gonna dance."
"I beg your pardon," said Georgia.
To show her utter contempt for Jack, she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall.
"Hey you, come here."
"Yes, you.
Do you want to dance?"
"You see, I'm very particular about whom I dance with."
And there he stood, the dauntless cavalier, guarding... her sanctuary.
"If you wanna make a hit with your lady friend,"
"you should put your hat on straight, like this!"
"Take that you...
"Huh! Very good."
"Didn't know me own strength," said the Little Fellow.
Hank Curtis' cabin was a stone's throw from the dancehall.
Hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the Far North.
Hank was kind and human, and our hero cold and hungry, and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot.
So the Little Fellow devised a way of getting breakfast.
Big Jim recovered from the blow he received from Black Larson but lost his memory.
Hank's partner arrives.
Both are ready to leave on a long expedition.
Hank informs his partner that the Little Fellow is to look after the cabin while he's away.
"Goodbye," said Hank. "And don't forget to feed the mule."
Since that night in the dancehall the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia, but an incident was to bring them together again.
There she stood, her loveliness lighting the room, filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill-fitted.
As she introduced her friends, his heart began to sing.
As they warmed up by the stove, he excused himself to get firewood.
And in that cabin his secret was revealed, his love for Georgia.
And the girls giggled and laughed, perhaps in order to hide their pity.
For in the world of the dancehall it wasn't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts.
And so they thought they'd have a little fun with him.
There in the gloaming they sat, their faces alight with mischief, but all the while his heart was singing.
And so she fooled and flirted and stroked his hair.
He knew she was fooling, but he was happy.
For she was near him, holding his hand, smiling at him.
"Nice place you have here," said Georgia.
"I hope you will invite us again."
What if she were fooling?
He was enjoying the warmth of her attention.
And the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair.
And now she was leaving.
The light of her loveliness would be gone.
And he would be left with an emptiness, to return to his bleak, lonely existence.
"Pardon me," said the Little Fellow,
"But, uh..." He was lost for words.
"Would you really like to come again?"
"Of course," said Georgia.
"What do you say, girls?"
"We'll come for dinner New Year's Eve," said the ladies.
"Very well," said Georgia.
"We'll come to dinner New Year's Eve."
Of course at that moment Georgia would forget her gloves!
For the next few days the Little Fellow hustled and shoveled in order to buy that New Year's dinner.
The eve of a new year.
New hopes and new dreams.
And there was Georgia, caressing him with her smiles and tender glances.
And the girls called for a speech.
But he was too happy to speak.
All that mattered was Georgia was there. Georgia!
So he muttered and stuttered and finally said,
"I can't make a speech but I'll do a dance."
And a dance he did, with the rolls.
In the midst of all their revelry the vague memory of a promise crept into Georgia's mind.
"Let's go up and visit the Little Fellow," she said.
"We'll have some fun with him," said Jack.
"We'll send Georgia in first, then give him a scare."
"Oh, forget it," said Jack. "How about giving me a little attention?"
A day or so later in the Recorder's office,
Big Jim tried to convince the assayers that he had a mountain of gold.
"Where is this place?" they said.
But Big Jim's memory had failed him.
All he knew was that it was near the cabin.
"The cabin, that's it!"
"f I could find my way to the cabin I could find the mine."
"But I can't remember."
"Hey!" said Jack, "Georgia's been looking for you."
The Little Fellow knew otherwise.
How dare that cad mention her name so lightly?
For two pins he'd give him another thrashing.
However being a little underweight he would ignore the insult.
Georgia had been looking for him.
Georgia had written him a letter.
And as he went looking for Georgia, so Big Jim went looking for him.
"You, you!" said Big Jim.
The very man I've been looking for!"
"The cabin, the cabin!
Where is it?"
"Answer me, I say!"
"Can't you speak, man?
Tell me!"
"Where's the cabin? Where is it?"
"At last I shall find my mountain of gold."
"To your feet man, quick!"
"You're coming with me!"
"Take me to the cabin and I'll make you a millionaire!"
"Georgia!
Just a moment," said the Little Fellow.
"Georgia, you don't have to explain. I understand."
I'll take you away from this life."
"I'm going away, and when I return,"
"I shall come back."
Exhausted and footweary, they arrived at the cabin.
"Ah!" said Big Jim, "it won't be long now."
"Bring in the eats and tomorrow we'll start for the mine.
"Here, take a swig of this. It'll put hair on your topcoat."
"My, this is a heavy lamb chop," said the Little fellow.
Then fate - it's always fate - played its little joke, and again the elements laughed, roared and thundered, but through it all our heroes soundly slumbered.
Then came the dawn.
The Little Fellow awoke, blissfully ignorant of what happened the night before, but feeling definitely conscious of "the morning after".
"Oh well, may as well tidy up and get breakfast."
"This is the worst liver attack I've ever had."
"Feel that rocking?"
"It's the stomach."
"It's not the stomach."
"Let's go to the other side."
"We'll see how far it will go over."
"Something must be missing underneath."
"I'll go outside and see what it is."
"Now," said Big Jim, "don't get excited."
"Take it easy, don't move, don't breathe!"
"I said don't breathe, stupid."
"You can be most annoying at times."
"If you'll only be cool, be calm," said Big Jim,
"We have nothing to worry about."
"Now show a little character!
Where's your willpower?"
"Now listen, I've got a very good idea."
"Hold your hands like this, then I can get out first."
"You see what I mean?" said Big Jim.
"Your mind is chaotic. You have no psychology."
"You have no control."
And Big Jim discovered his claim!
"Now we shall be rich," said Jim.
"We shall be millionaires!"
And so they were.
Now they were homeward bound and they were leaving the hardship and toil of Alaska to live in the land of milk and honey.
They were famous, and sought after by the press.
In their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon.
The reporter wanted to write the Little Fellow's life story, "From Rags to Riches", and he graciously consented.
And Big Jim was manicured.
"Not the nails," said he, "the corns."
The reporter thought of a good idea, to have the Little Fellow pose in his mining clothes.
It would make a human story.
Georgia...
There she was in the steerage.
Neither knew of the other's presence.
Georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard.
"You!" said Georgia.
"I thought I'd never see you again."
And then she mistook him for the stowaway.
The officer was going to put him in irons.
But Georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare.
"Heck!" said the Captain. "That's no stowaway."
"That's Big Jim's partner, the multimillionaire."
Then of course there were apologies.
The Little Fellow gathered himself together.
James, the valet, was told to prepare for an extra guest.
"Pardon me," said the reporter, "but who's the lady?"
"Oh, you don't say!
Well, congratulations."
"This will make a great story, and with a happy ending."
And so it was.
The Unholy Three
Twas a balmy summer evening, And a goodly crowd was there.
Hercules!
The mighty...marvelous...
mastodonic model of muscular masculinity!
Never smoke cigarettes and you'll be a strong man like him.
Professor Echo!
God's gifted genius!
The velvet-voiced ventriloquist!
Nemo, how would you like to walk over to my house and have a drink?
Why walk?
Let's run!
Sweet Rosie O'Grady.
That's all there is to life, friends, a little laughter...a little tear...
This dollar pamphlet contains one thousand wheezes and jokes, a guaranteed tonic for dull care!
Now, folks, that's just a sample of the lady's art!
The show on the inside starts immediately!
See her do the dance that broke the Sultan's thermometer.
You're there, Rosie, the best pal a guy ever had!
And tonight when we eat, I'm goin' to buy you a swell steak!
I just couldn't hold out on you, Echo.
You're to square a guy!
I'm glad you done that, Rosie.
Money got that way never done no one no good!
Tweedledee!
Twenty inches!
Twenty pounds!
The Twentieth Century Curiosity!
The Demi-Tasse Daddy.
Fools!
Midnight.
You see, my plan is so ridiculous... so simple... that it scares you.
But... if you come with me, we'll clean up millions.
It's spooky!
It sounds... unholy!
That's it!
We'll be the Unholy Three!
The day before Christmas...
And how is Hector McDonald, my Grandma's little parrot seller?
Don't let her tease you, Hector.
Little Willie darling heard your voice.
He wants you to take him bye-bye.
You're just an old darling, Hector.
I won't tease you any more.
You're makin a play for that guy!
Since when do you own me?
If you tip that boob off to who we are, I'll lay some lilies under your chin!
If you don't stop yelling, you'll tip him off yourself.
I'll get a Mrs. O'Grady.
I think you'd better show the parrots.
They talk so well for you.
Echo, the ventriloquist, could make wooden dummies talk... now watch the jolly parrots.
Isn't it wonderful how the parrots always talk to your Grandma?
That house, where you called about the parrot, was robbed last night.
This is Mr. Arlington.
The parrot you sold me doesn't talk.
Here's another parrot that won't talk.
All right, I'll come over.
I'm sure when the bird sees me it will feel more at home.
The lady from the bird store, Mr. Arlington.
may I leave him here?
He might cry if he sees the...
B-I-R-D
Take mine, darling... and Granny will get you some red beads just like those.
He's always been so fond of beads!
Christmas Eve and then, Echo says to my, "Granny will get you some red beads just like those"!
Yes, and before morning Granny will have those pretty red beads.
Hector's out there with a Christmas tree for little Willie.
Didn't I order you to stay away from that guy?
I wasn't with him!
I met him on the corner headed for here!
Wait for me in the kitchen.
You go back to bed, Mrs. O'Grady.
Rosie and I will trim the tree.
we're gonna pull that Arlington job tonight.
Oh, I'm mad at Granny!
She won't stay in bed!
Perhaps she wants to help us trim the tree.
Yes, she'd love to do some trimming.
That guy bossin me...
me and my strength!
He's too jealous to leave her with that boob.
Come on... we'll turn this trick alone!
I've a secret I want you to share.
I'm going to ask Rosie to merry me.
But I'm not going to give her the ring until tomorrow.
You and your strength!
You're yellow, you big stiff... or you'd come with me.
You heard me!
You're yellow!
JOHN ARLINGTON MURDERED IN HOME BY JEWEL THIEVES.
'Oh, spare my life', said Mr. Arlington, 'spare my life'!
You... filth!
Don't you realize that you've murdered a man?
That's why I said we'd never carry a gun!
Was there anybody beside yourselves know the rubies were here in the house?
Ther was on old woman from a bird store who saw the rubies.
If you don't want no part of these, because of how we got 'em... then me and the Kid wll take 'em.
You're gonna put 'em back in the safe with the rest of our stuff!
I'm from Police Headquarters.
Oh, yes.
Mr. Arlington was one of my best customers.
You were at Mr. Arlington's home yesteday, weren't you?
Did the man you saw with Mr. Arlington look as if he would commit such a crime?
The reason I ask is because sometimes the least little thing gives us a clue.
I hate to see anybody tease a baby.
I don't like to take his toys from him.
Let's finish our talk in the store.
You sold a parrot to Mr. Arlington. Who delivered it?
Oh! So you delivered it yourself?
You forget easy, don't you?
So long.
I'll see you later.
That dick has a line on us...
we gotta think fast!
He's got a hunch Hector turneed this trick.
Let's plant the jewels in the boob's room!
That's it!
Make him the fall guy!
That's what we hired him for, isn't it...
in case we got in a jam?
Christmas night...
Don't you think my savings are enough for us to start on?
If I loved a man, he wouldn't have to have a dime!
Oh!
If you loved a man!
Then why have you let me go on hoping?
Aw, I've just been kidding!
Oh, Hector, I tried so hard to let you know I love you...
I've been a crook... a pick-pocket!
But you're not going to be any more.
I did some pretty bad things myself...
when I was young.
Gee, but you've made this a great Christmas, Rosie.
Gee, but you've made this a great Christmas, Rosie!
Ain't you the kidder?
No, Echo, I'm on the lovel.
I love him!
Thanks.
What are you going to do?
You'll find out soon enough!
Extry! Extry!
Arlington murderer arrested!
What a bonehead I was to overlook that!
McDonald's alibi, that he was at Mrs. O'Grady bird store, will, be investigated by the police.
That means more investigation... but there ain't goin to be no Mrs. O'Grady when they get here!
Yes there is goin to be a Mrs. O'Grady...
that dick saw me here...
You guys can get out of your make-up...
but I can't!
¡And I ain't going to the chair alone!
And neither is Hector McDonald going to the chair!
Now, laugh that off... you big stiff!
Regan is on his way to O'Grady's bird store.
Here's one thing stronger that you...
and I might need him.
It was Spring before the grim machinery of the law worked around to the case of Hector McDonald.
Does the defendant's attorney intend to produce the alleged witnesses, Mrs. O'Grady and her grand-daught?
While in a secluded cabin in the mountains...
In his prison cell he sits.
How about just us two dividing the stuff?
Maybe I got a better palan.
You can save him, Echo.
And, if you will, I'll stick with you.
I'll never see Hector again.
Yes! You'd stick with me...
but you'd go on loving him.
...and the minute he's free, you'd double-cross me and go back to him.
Don't you understand...
I'll do anything to save him!
I love him, Echo... I love him.
I'd even take that from you.
After that, you don't want to change your mind about sticking with me?
He would always have Rosie... if he saved Hector.
This was the thought that took Echo secretly to the city.
Your Honor, I object!
He is mis-stating the evidence!
Objection over-ruled!
Have you lawyer put you back on the witness stand.
When you get there keep repeating the Lord's prayer. Move your lips But don't utter a sound.
Have faith in miracles.
Mrs. O'Grady.
It's Mrs. O'Grady's handwriting...
and she's not here!
Your Honor, may the defendant take the stand again to give new evidence?
In a case so serious as his, with a man's life at stake, the court cannot reasonably deny your request.
Speak louder!
Your Honor, and gentlemen of the jury...
There was an old woman who was a man...
and two others... the Unholy Three...
First, it was an old woman and her grand-daughter. Now, the old woman is a man!
What next?
That wasn't me talking!
I didn't say a word!
...and it must be remembered that defense has failed to produce a single witness to confirm the prisoner's story!
You mean... you want me to go with you?
There's a fortune for just us two to split. What do you say?
Do you think he's guilty?
Will he get the chair?
I'm Echo, the ventriloquist...
Grandma O'Grady of the 'Unholy Three'!
Your Honor, I want to make a full confession!
The Law can be kind...
And Echo's confession won freedom for both himself and Hector.
Dear Hector:
I'll never see you again...
I can't explain... but always summber I love you, Hector...
Good Bya.
Echo, you remember what I promised if you saved Hector?
Well... I'm here.
Aw, what's the use of us kiddin, Rosie.
We don't love each other.
You run along to Hector.
Do you really mean that, Echo?
Good-by, old Pal!
That's all there is to life, friends... a little laughter... a little tear...

Achmed
Peri Banu

Great was the might of the African Sorcerer
In the city of the Caliph they were celebrating the ruler's birthday
The Great Caliph
"A magic horse, Exalted Caliph, which flies through the air"
Princess Dinarzade, the Caliph's daughter
Prince Achmed, her brother
"I will not part with this horse for mere gold!"
"So choose any of my treasures"
"May I have whatever I desire?"
"I swear it-by the Beard of the Prophet!"
The Story of Prince Achmed
"How can one bring the horse back down to earth?"
"The lever at the head drives it into the air..."
"...and the lever at the tail brings it to earth"
"Does the Prince know this?"
Far from his homeland he landed on one of the magic islands of Waq Waq
The Prince was young, and brave and eager for adventure
"Who are you, maidens?"
"We serve the Princess Peri Banu, ruler of the spirit land of Waq Waq"
"Stay with us, handsome stranger"
On a neighbouring island lay a magic lake
...where every night the exquisite Peri Banu and her attendants bathed
"Give back my cloak of feathers!"
"Come with me to my beautiful homeland"
Thus was the Princess Peri Banu taken from the land of spirits
The horse carried them to far away China
"Do not be afraid of me"
"I am yours to command to the end of time"
"You do not know the power of the spirits of Waq Waq!"
"They will kill you!"
"Allah's mercy will protect us if you will be my wife"
Meanwhile, the Sorcerer searched for his magic horse
"We will find our home and you will forget all about Waq Waq"
"I will follow you!"
"The Prince sends you this garment"
"He bids me lead you to him"
Adventures in China
The Emperor of China
The Emperor's Jester
Hither the Sorcerer brought Peri Banu to sell her to the Emperor
The Emperor smiled upon Peri Banu
"Kill her, or take her to wife!"
"Now, my brave Prince, I shall return to your sister"
In this mountain dwelt the Sorcerer's greatest enemy the Fire Mountain Witch
"How dare you come to my magic mountain?"
"The African Sorcerer brought me hither"
"He is my greatest enemy!"
"And we are friends"
The Bridegroom
"Help me free Peri Banu"
"I fear no spirits!"
"With these weapons you can conquer the spirits"
The Bride
Far below, at that moment, the wedding of Peri Banu
"We must stop the wedding"
The spirits of Waq Waq look for their mistress
"Take me to Waq Waq"
THE GATES OF WAQ WAQ OPEN ONLY TO THE ONE WHO THE MAGIC LAMP OF ALADDIN POSSESSES
Aladdin and the Magic Lamp
"I am Aladdin"
"Where is the Magic Lamp?"
"Do you not have it?"
"I will tell you"
"I was a poor tailor in the city of the Caliph"
"One day I was visited by a mysterious stranger"
"Behold Dinarzade, the daughter of the Caliph"
"You shall have her, once you do something for me"
"He led me to a high mountain"
The Magic Lamp
"Fetch the Lamp"
"Give me the Lamp!"
"First let me out!"
"Then die!
I have other ways to obtain the Lamp!"
"I languished long in the dark cave until I succeeded in lighting the Lamp"
"What is your command, O Master?"
"I am your servant, I and all the Spirits of the Lamp"
"Take me home"
"Now I knew I could win the Princess Dinarzade"
"In a single night I built her a splendid palace"
"Next morning the astounded Caliph visited the enchanted building"
"So she became my wife"
"The Caliph is my father, Dinarzade-my sister"
"Tell me, what happened further?"
"One day everything vanished - the palace, Dinarzade and the Lamp"
"I fled before the fury of the Caliph"
"I set out to sea"
"A fearful storm blew up"
"And so you found me"
"Do you know who did this to you?"
"The African Sorcerer!"
"He loved Dinarzade"
"Hurry, Achmed, and free Peri Banu"
"The spirits want to kill her, because she left to follow you"
"The Sorcerer has stolen the Magic Lamp"
"Only the Lamp can open the gates of Waq Waq"
"Kill the Sorcerer and the Lamp is yours!"
"Kill him!"
"I will try"
"Your enemy is dead!"
The Spirit Battle of Waq Waq
The spirits rose up against their faithless mistress
"Prince Achmed stands before the gates!"
"Bring out Peri Banu!"
"Summon the Spirits of the Lamp, Aladdin!"
Yet the spirits of darkness came before him
Aladdin was overwhelmed
"The Lamp!"
The Witch intervened
Now legions of benevolent spirits streamed out of the Magic Lamp
"Behold!
The palace!"
"Return and seek happiness in the land of mortals"
"Dinarzade must be in the palace"
The towers of the Caliph's city soon appeared before them
"Aladdin's palace has returned!"
Meanwhile, the call to morning prayer sounded from the minarets

Robert Herlth, Walter Réhrig
Behold:
The portals of darkness are open and the shadows of the dead hunt over the Earth...
Why dost thou scourge mankind with war, plague, famine?
The Earth is mine!
Never will the Earth be thine!
Man is good: he strives for Truth!
Look below!
All things in heaven and on Earth are wonderful!
But the greatest wonder is man's freedom to choose between good and evil!
Dost thou know Faust? !
A knave like all others!
He preaches good and does evil!
He seeks to turn base metal into gold!
Behold his greed!
A wager: I will wrest Faust's soul away from God!
If thou canst destroy what is divine in Faust, the Earth is thine!
No man can resist evil!
The bet is on!
The Plague! ...
The Plague!
The devastating epidemic raged:
within a few days half the town lay dying!
To find a cure for the plague Faust spent day and night in prayer with God.
...and a great shriek rose from Egypt, for there was not a house without its dead
Lord God, bless this act of redemption!
Only you can alleviate our misery!
Help... help!
My mother is dying!
Mortal terror and fear of death swept through the town...
Repent, fast and pray!
Only faith can vanquish death!
Show respect for the dead!
We still live. We still love!
We shall die dancing in each other's arms!
Who has faith shall live!
But death will take the sinners!
The Plaguel!
Compassion, Faust!
Only you can help us!
We are lost!
Neither faith nor knowledge is any help!
Everything is a lie...
My Lord, thou art merciful and a great goodness
The third great key to the force of the ghost of hell
I invoke thy aid, Spirit of Darkness:
show thyself!
Come forth, demon of evil!
As thou art called with thy unholy name:
MEPHISTO appear!
You have summoned me!
I renounce God and his heavenly legion and so all the power and glory of the world shall be mine
Be gone from me, Satan!
To have the power to help for just one day!
One day! Try it! Just one trial day!
When the sand runs out you will be free, the pact cancelled!
G LO RY
POWER
Can you help the hungry and the sick?
What you wish, I will perform:
You are the master, and I am your servant!
A drop of blood!
Blood is quite a remarkable substance!
For one day only -? !
Until the sand has run out!
Faust! Help us!
Then I shall help in the devil's name!
A miracle!
In the name of Christ crucified, help my child!
He cannot look upon the Holy Cross!
He is in league with the devil!
Stone him! Stone him!
Deliver me, elixir of death!
You cannot cheat me!
Remember our pact!
The trial day is not over yet!
Death sets all men free!
Is that death?
It is life, Faust, seducing you with the fair image of your youth!
Wretched Faust, why do you seek death:
You have not yet lived!
I despise my life!
Your life was only the dust and mould of books!
Pleasure is everything!
I am too old!
I offer you the greatest happiness:
Youth!
Seize it!
Give me youth!
I've caught you, old boy!
Take me... to her!
Step upon my cloak and the spinning Earth will spread before you!
The wedding feast for the Duchess of Parma: the most beautiful woman in Italy!
Strange guests!
To pay tribute to the highest beauty, my lord brings you his kingdom's treasures!
The trial day is over! The sand has run out!
Be as you were!
Youth...
leave me my youthl!
I am enslaved for eternity!
Faust, you have tasted all of life's pleasures!
From indulgence to indulgence... sensation without end!
Yet nothing satisfied you!
What do you want?
A woman, a game of chance, an orgy?
Whatever you wish, I must grant!
Do you want the emperor's crown? !
Home!
Take me home! At once!
Is today a feast day in your town?
Are you heathen born that you have never heard of Holy Easter? !
It is as if life had stood still:
All is as it once was...!
An innocent little girl runs to a priest...
She is not for you...!
Praise the Lord the mighty king of honour...
Holiday, Mother!
I know more obliging wenches for you here!
I only want her!
Do as I command!
Brother Valentin!
Once this little golden chain is in the house, she will begin to feel the devil's power!
Good gracious, how pretty you are!
Any lovers yet?
What do you have there, child?
Tell her, my child, if you don't want to tell me!
May I visit Aunt Marthe?
Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein
Three little drops from this love potion and all the girls' hearts will be yours!
Aunt Marthe, look what I found in my drawer...!
A rich treasure!
I found it in my drawer!
Let me try on this beautiful necklace just the once!
A small bouquet for the bridegroom, a little wreath for the bride...
Excuse me, lovely lady, I seek Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein!
From your cousin... from Lombardy...!
He gave me this necklace as a gift for you!
Those we encircle within this ring, shall be sweethearts...!
One, two, three, makes you free...!
Pardon: my stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink!
Allow me to mix myself a little drink, that I learned to make in Padua!
My friend, a prince of the noblest blood!
He loves me he loves me not he loves me...
Yes, with all his heart he loves you!
She loves me she loves me not... She loves you!
I am yours forever!
He loves me...!
What are you waiting for! ?
Your sweetheart lights the way for you...!
Cursed matchmaker!
I will keep the brother out of the way!
To the prettiest girl in town!
No other girl is as pretty as your sister:
Long live Gretchen!
A pretty girl is not pure!
Here's to Gretchen!
Here's to your Gretchen!
If you hurry, you can catch her lover before he slips out of her room!
Flee... flee...
You have murdered him!
Murder...
Murder...!
Flee! ... Flee!
Don't touch me, you wench!
Your lover has slain me!
Read me my requiem mass first! Then: take this harlot to the stocks!
Gretchen...
Gretchen...!
Now death and nature with surprise, behold the trembling sinners rise to meet the judge's searching eyes...
For now before the judge no crime can pass unpunished here...
All hidden things must appear plain!
And a little child has been born, in the depth of winter...
Have mercy on my child!
Aren't you Gretchen, who stood in the stocks? !
Mercy! Mercy!
My child is dying!
She has killed her child!
Seize her, the murderess!
Faust...
Faust... help your Gretchen!
Mephisto!
You have betrayed me!
She suffers... she suffers!
To the stake with the child murderer!
Save her, save Gretchenl!
Too late!
They're already building her funeral pyre!
You are still my servant!
Take me to her, or the pact is broken!
My steed awaits!
Quick, before morning comes!
Faster... faster!
Oh, had I never wished for youth that brought this misery!
Curse... curse the delusion of youth!
You have yourself cursed youth!
What you wish, I must grant!
Be as you were: an old man!
Forgive... forgive me my sin!
Gretchen...!
Here is no place for thee!
I claim my wager!
One word breaks thy pact!
What is the word?
What is the word?

The Yukon
The gold rush has brought them to this desert coast
The Irishman Michael Dennin (Vladimir Fogel)
The chairman Hans Nelson, (Sergei Komarov) a Swede
Nelson's wife, the Englishwoman Edith (Aleksandra Khokhlova)
Shareholder Dutchy (Porfiri Podobed)
Shareholder Harky (Pyotr Galadzhev)
There's no gold in this mine - we have to look elsewhere.
Go, Dennin, collect the instruments - we are moving!
The company's gold mine
The company's success lasted throughout the winter.
Small house - great fortune!
The output of gold continued...
I was the one who found the gold and they make me their washer woman!
Spring came slowly.
Lunch
Dennin won't be joining us - he is no longer hungry. He lost his appetite due to envy!
Your health, Mister Dennin!
Stop it...
Not without the law - it's a white man!
The weather changed abruptly.
One inch per hour.
I'll kill you all some day anyway!
He's dead...
The two graves are ready - if the Yukon doesn't flood them.
The two murder victims make their way ... through the storm and darkness to their burial chambers.
After the storm the top of the frozen Yukon was left covered with water.
Days went by in a tormenting silence.
Man or woman - one of them always sat... next to the criminal.
Give me something to drink!
The ice on the Yukon began to break
Daytime.
Daytime again.
What do you intend to do with me?
We will treat you by the law.
I am so tired, so tired ...
The tobacco is running out.
Give me back my tobacco!
Not without the law!
Edith's birthday came.
Take it out!
It's for you - a birthday present ...
Shave me ...
Shave him already!
Today is my birthday!
Why did you do that?
It seemed so terribly simple to me.
And you always said, I would end up on the gallows!
Days went by ... but it could not have been predicted ... that the law would arrive earlier ... than in a few weeks.
Let's pronounce judgement.
Not today, today is sunday!
The Queen of England
Edith insisted ... that the procedure ... should follow English law ... since the criminal ... was one of the Queen's subjects.
Accused, you are an Irishman ... and therefore we will pass judgement over you ... in the name of Queen Victoria.
The Judges
The Witnesses
The Jurors
The Verdict
Michael Dennin, by the Queen's law you shall be hanged by the neck ... until you are dead.
Dead ... dead ...
I spoke well.
Like in a real court ...
And now it's all over.
They say death is not agonising ...
The designated time came.
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy upon us!
I couldn't have done a better job if I had had to make it for you, Hans!
The Execution
May God ... accept you, repentant sinner!
Here - For good luck!
The End
Gold on Indian land!
The Sioux tribes were given other reservation, and President Grant set a day when settlers might race for possession of the rich lands.
By the President of the United States of America Proclamation
In the middle of the seventies, ship of hope bore thousands of emigrants to seek the reality of their dreams in America.
Some sought happiness ...
some only the horn of plently ... the chalice of ... the Unholy Grail ...
And from crowded eastern cities, civilization began pouring the overflow into the trackless immensity of the West.
Spring, 1876 ...
Old World blood began to fuse with Colonial strains ... and "westward the course of empire takes its way".
In the Black Hills of Dakota, the outriders of progress had set up a trading post at Custer.
" Gold! Gold ...
I'm tellin' ye ... the mountains is just abustin' with it! "
" Sorry, Lucas, but we can't touch that land ... it's on the Sioux Reservation. "
" Where'd you strike it, Lucas? "
And then came the eager thud of hoofs and the creak of wagon wheels.
The start of an empire that was to be compounded from the peoples of the face of the earth!
Dan O'Malley had came from Ireland at a smile a minute pace.
♫ " All the way from Ireland ♫
♫ With a Swede named Squaarehead Joe ♫
♫ Bound to find Dakota ♫
♫ And my calico! "♫
" The wheel came off. "
" Oh, did it ? "
" Something ought to be done about it."
" You must have traveled a lot to know all those things."
" I can fix it. "
" Don't let me stop you."
" I'm Mayor Carleton of Virginia.
Suh ... this is my daughter Lee."
" My name and address is Dan O'Malley."
" We're on our way to the Dakota rush ...
With these race horses."
" Sure, an' you'll be needin' speed that day!
Th' Dagoes are askin' Saint Anthony for wings ...
An' th' Irish who have 'em! "

" Bull " Stanley ...
Who lived day by day on pluck, powder and providence.
Mike Costigan and " Spade " Allen weren't exactly thieves ... but they had a habit of finding horses that nobody had lost.
" Chaw ? "
" Naw ! "
" Am I seeing' things ... or is them million wagons on the square? "
" Pardner ... where-you all bound for? "
" Sufferin' coyotes ... yer don't mean t' say you ain't heard tell about gold in the Dakotas! "
" We're goin' to the Dakotas ...
" It ain't gold I'm looking for ...
but it's a man jest as yeller ..."
Hundreds of gold-mad men swarmed Custer, awaiting word to rush for the ore-ladened lands.
Sheriff Layne Hunter, running the mushroom town with a high hand;
keeping his own lawless gang in cheek by a generous division of the spoils.
" Layne, please don't make me stay in there with those ... women ..."
" Just for tonight, Millie ... tomorrow we'll find a better place."
" A string of race hosses ...
about fifteen miles back ... an' only two men herding' them! "
" Thoroughbreds! "
" Why the low-down hoss-thieves! "
" Nothin' to it ... our businness is gettin' overcrowded."
" I have to goin' blind ... fired three shots and only dropped two of 'em."
" By golly ... he's a woman! "
" Put them hosses back ! "
Hour by hour, thousand by thousand, the stampeders crushed into Custer, as the big day neared.
Zach Little ... Editor of the Custer " Pathfinder ", was half Scotch and half seltzer.
" They had a lot of touble takin' out Spud Taylor's appendix ... they had to kill him first. "
THE EMPORIUM JOE MINSK
And still they come ...
lured by the magic word ...
" You are a minister of the Gospel, Sir? "
" There's a minister in town, Layne ...
now we can be married! "
" Parson ... this ain't exactly a Sunday School camp ... but they's some of us that'll be d...n glad you come along."
" Oh, bless these plows ... that they may make this wilderness blossom with the glory of God! "
" I'm Sheriff Hunter ... allow me ..."
" This lady's in my outfit ... if they's anything she needs, I'll 'tend to it! "
" Since when did the notorious ' Bull ' Stanley become so gallant ..."
"...
And Mike Costigan! Every sheriff west of the Mississippi has asked me to welcome you! "
"...
And 'Spade' Allen! Been shot at lately for card cheating? "
" I congratulate you, Miss ...
on your selection of friends! "
" Come along, my 3 Bad Men ...
it's time we were making camp."
" What you lookin' at ... hoss face? "
" They're dangerous men ... but I'll take care of them ...
Just outside the town ...
a camp for the night.
" I'm mighty grateful to you men for helping me through."
" We couldn't see anybody robbed."
" No, sir, not us! "
" I'd like to hire you three, but I suppose you have business to attend to ..."
" To tell the truth, miss ... our business ain't what it used to be."
" Then you're free ... for the moment? "
" Y.. y .. yes ... for the moment. "
" I ... I'm afraid I can't pay you any wages ... just yet."
" For the time bein', miss ... I'll work for nothin'..."
"... and I know my pardners will ! "
"Oh, gladly!"
" Then you'll be my men? "
♫ " Gettin' near Dakota. Just rarin' for to go ...♫
♫ Feelin' very mighty happy, 'Cause I've seen my calico! " ♫
Morning found a wagon city on the edge of the town.
" I'm sorry about ... er ...
yesterday, Miss Carleton."
" Drunk again ! "
" So are we ! "
" It's plumb low-down to do a thing like this ... an' her trusting' us! "
" I'm thinkin' three terrapins like us ain't fit to take care of a gal like her ..."
" What our gal needs is a husband! "
" Leave it to us!
We'll find a marrying' man ...
if we have to shoot him."
" So you're back again, Lucas? "
Brother, I have gone awug with the man I love.
Everithing is all right, as he has promised to marry me.
Lovingly, Millie.
Husband hunting ...
" Not a Chink ...
they get shot too easy."
" Thirty two."
" Twenty eight."
" I've just reached manhood."
" Then you'd better reach again! "
" Sound as a dollar ! "
" Come on ... you ain't safe alone."
" If a man's heart is in the right place, it don't matter what sex he belongs to."
Dan sold his outfit and joined the stampede.
" You're mine now ....
Hunter wanted to get rid of you and gave you to me."
" Ragamuffins! "
" Married? "
" Want a job? "
" I found a man ! "
" It's plumb unsafe for you to go ridin' alone that a-way."
" He's the new hired hand."
" But 'bull' ... I don't think we need any more help."
" Not so bad ..."
" Not so good ..."
" All right ... he'll do."
" Now let nature take its course."
" I hope he don't drink ..."
"... we don't want no soaks around here."
" I haven't seen your dad around ... Where is he? "
" Sheriff some of the better element ... are complaining about the way you run this town. "
" Listen, Rabbi ...
Business is terrible!
... Nobody buys a new suit even to be buried in. "
Cleanliness is next to Goldliness ...
That's why Saturday night comes before Sunday.
" You don't reckon she'll be wantin' us to take a bath, do you? "
" I'm a little nervous about it."
" Guard the tent."
" How about three fingers of bug juice?"
♫ " I'm here in Dakota I want the world to know ...♫
♫ Goin' to get a homstead. Cause I found my calico! " ♫
" Do you like that tune, Miss Lee? "
" Having a nice time ? "
" You're goin' to tell me how to get that gold ! "
" Hunter, you've been takin' in too much territory...
Now you're all through! "
" You bungling fool !"
" Hunter sent him to be make me tell the way to the gold land ..."
" ... my map won't do me any good now ... but it'll take you to where there's gold ! "
The night before the rush ....
Custer, an armed camp ... with "Bull" Stanley leading the revolt against Hunter.
... while in the little church the women pray ... for safety, today ...
Divine guidance tomorrow...
"... and as He led the children of Israel into the promised land, so He will lead us ..."
Knowing his danger, Hunter fans the flames of lawless abandon among his followers.
" Burn that psalm-singing preacher's shack! "
" Brother!
Brother! "
" Brother! "
" It's gettin' stuffy in here with all this smoke and love ...
I'm leavin' !"
" We'll sneak across the line tonight and wait. "
" Millie!
Little Sister! "
" Millie, who is ... the man? "
The Grand Land Rush!
Morning broke with the clatter of wagons ... the roaring, sweating, cursing, fighting mob scrambling ... for position in the line.
" It's time for you to start, Missy ...
you've got a long, hard ride ahead ..."
" I'm ready when you are, 'Bull'! "
" Mike and 'Spade' will take care of you ...
I've got to look for someone else."
" Please, 'Bull'...
Ready for the dot of twelve ...
And the race for land and gold.

" What time is it? "
" One minute to twelwe, Sir."
" The Carleton crowd leading!

The end of a day of furious riding ...
the Carleton far ahead.
BUSTED BY GOD
" The parson was right, Ned; we'll stay right here.
This soil is as rich as gold."
Hunter sights his prey and the Carleton seek escape through a narrow pass to the gold country.
" You and Miss Lee go on ahead ... we'll follow along. "
" Well, partners ... I guess us three ole sharpshooters is together for the last reunion."
" Shucks!
One good man could hold this pass against a whole army of men like Hunter. "

THE END A FOX PRODUCTION
The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta, Ga., in the Spring of 1861.
There were two loves in his life.
Fort Sumter has been fired upon.
Then the war is here.
Yes, dad, and I'm going to be one of the first to enlist.
Aren't you going to enlist ?
Your name ?
Occupation ?
Engineer on the Western and Atlantic Railroad.
Don't enlist him.
He is more valuable to the South as an engineer.
We can't use you.
Bartender.
If you lose this war don't blame me.
Did Johnnie enlist ?
He didn't even get in line.
He's a disgrace to the South.
Why didn't you enlist ?
They wouldn't take me.
Please don't lie...
I don't want you to speak to me again until you are in uniform.
A year later.
In a Union encampment just North of Chattanooga.
General Thatcher, and his chief spy, Captain Anderson.
I know every foot of this railroad from Marietta to Chattanooga... and with ten picked men I cannot fail.
We will enter the South as civilians coming from the neutral state of Kentucky to join the Southern cause.
Then the day you steal the train I will have General Parker advance to meet you.
As soon as I arrive I will let you know how seriously father is wounded.
Big Shanty.
Twenty minutes for dinner.
Three men stole my General.
I think they are deserters.
Why not stop and fight them ?
I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered.
The Southern army facing Chattanooga is ordered to retreat.
General Parker's victorious Northern army advancing.
There is only one man on that engine.
In the enemy's country hopelessly lost, helplessly cold and horribly hungry.
At nine o'clock tomorrow morning our supply trains will meet and unite with General Parker's army at the Rock River bridge.
Then the army, backed by our supply trains, will advance for a surprise attack on the rebels' left flank
Once our trains and troops cross that bridge, nothing on earth can stop us.
This girl was in the baggage car when we stole the train, so I thought it best to hold her.
We had better stay here until daybreak to see where we are.
It was so brave of you to risk your life, coming into the enemy's country, just to save me.
After a nice, quiet, refreshing night's rest.
We've got to get back to our lines somehow and warn them of this coming attack.
I will get that spy before he reaches the Southern lines.
You follow with the supply trains as planned.
We must pick up more firewood.
The Rock River bridge.
The Northern division nearing the bridge to meet the supply trains.
That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river.
Heroes of the day.
Is that your uniform ?
I had to wear it to get through the lines.
Take it off !
Enlist the Lieutenant.
Soldier.

En 2009, Buenos Aires International Independent Film Festival financed an internegative. This copy comes from it.
During the rendering of this edition, the screening speed was adjusted, also, the lights were corrected.
Back to the Bulín...
As a good Argentine, he greets the audience.
A gloomy old café in La Boca.
A piece of the mean world, painted with light and shade.
All the blasphemy of the world is written on its walls. Nevertheless, one can blush hearing the stories that the guapos (gangsters) Still have to tell.
("MUCHA ESPUMA":
ALVARO ESCOBAR)
To be loosen by a woman is like delivering a kite to the storms of life.
At the first pull, paf!
You have to bring them down and fly them again once they are quiet enough.
Recently I had to beat my wife so hard, I almost kill her.
In that moment, "Pulguita" (Flea) showed up. She was "Mucha Espuma" 's well known wife, a sweet loving woman...
What are you doing hanging out here, fool?
You'd better go home and do the dishes.
Don't tease me "Pulguita"!
L warn you, I'll get mad at you...
Long ago "Laucha Colorada" (Red Rat)
Had put an eye on Pulguita. Being a rat, he would go after that cheese without worrying about the cat, in other words, her husband.
When are you going to make up your mind "Pulguita"?
Can't you see that I am mad about you? If you don't say yes, I'll kill myself. L'll drink poison.
Can't you see the lifestyle you could have if you were mine? Cabarets, champagne, silk clothes...
How can you be with that fool? He can't even give you a black eye or send you to the emergency room.
"Uña de Oro" (Golden Finger Nail) Was tired of stealing and wanted a new life.
These kinds of cases are not very usual in the underworld.
The gangster needed "Uña de Oro"
for a robbery and other errands, and wanted to make sure that he was going to accomplish the task.
Pulguita was ready to receive her husband with flowers. She was a loving wife at the end of the day.
Try to get "Mucha Espuma".
He's so stupid that he can be helpful.
DEFEATED Or... KNOCKED OUT
After the beating the sweet woman fell asleep. She dreamt she was making "empanadas" (Argentinean meal) With the remains of her husband.
Let's keep it quiet, I don't want to wake her up.
L have beaten her so hard that she fell asleep.
That was good training.
L'm ready for tonight.
You have to join us in the robbery. L know you are a gangster.
L think you are a whistle blower.
Why didn't you show up at Vuelta de Rocha?
L don't want to be a thief anymore!
L want to be an honorable man!
Honorable?
You are a double-crosser!
The next day, after a night of knives.
Forgive me, I'm leaving, I'll run away, I'm out, gone.
L'm sick and tired of all your lies.
"Pulguita".
Buh! You are sad because you used to be a mean man and now you want to be good.
The same thing happened to me... Look how happy I am!
Forget you consciousness as I forgot that mean woman who didn't care about my loving.
Do you think I am still sad about her leaving?
L don't give a damn!
Do as I say, "Uña de Oro".
Put you heart aside and laugh as I do.
"Uña de Oro" had changed his name.
He was now a decent worker who used to wake up early. He tried to make "Mucha Espuma" walk the line.
Come on, wake up!
Didn't you say that you were going to start working today?
And then Pulguita got to know the night life, cabarets, champagne and all those silk clothes...
If this is the kind of life you want, you can keep it, I don't want this!
L am sick of all this quietness and cleanliness!
"Mucha Espuma"'s days were as long as a stammerer's speech.
Used to the rolling pin, he knew something was missing.
L didn't know I loved you that much.
Get out of here, you were so ungrateful...
You trollop!
L don't like you in those clothes. You looked much better on your simple dress. You look like a...
Don't tear it...
Soon after its premiere, the film Metropolis was severely truncated and alterations were made.
From that time onward, more than a quarter of the film was assumed to have been lost.
Then, in 2008, a virtually complete version of the film was discovered in Buenos Aires.
A considerable amount of the film reconstruction was able to be completed and the correct sequence of its editing established by means of this Argentinian material.
Spanish intertitles have been translated into German with the aid of the censor-cards.
In order to display in their correct position on the image the cropped elements taken from the 16mm negative, the missing portion of the frame has been marked by black.
The intertitles appear with their original graphic treatment.
Shorter gaps are indicated by small segments of black leader.

Epigraph:
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!
Shift change.
Deep beneath the earth lay the City of the Workers.
Fathers, for whom every revolution of a mechanical wheel meant gold, had bestowed upon their sons the wonder of the Eternal Gardens.
Which of you ladies shall today have the honour of entertaining Master Freder, Joh Fredersen's son?
Look! These are your brothers!
Look ― !
These are your brothers!
Who ― was that?
But this was what happened to Freder ― the son of Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis ― as he sought out the girl:
To the new Tower of Babel ― to my father ― !
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of this explosion from my son, and not from you ― !
Details ― !
What were you looking for in the Machine-Halls, Freder?
I wanted to look into the faces of the people whose little children are my brothers, my sisters...
Your magnificent city, Father ― and you the brain of this city ― and all of us within the light of this city... ―
...and where are the people, Father, whose hands built your city ― ?
Off where they belong off where they belong...?
...in the Depths...?
And if those in the Depths one day rise against you?
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine, Grot, ― with an important message...
There were two more copies of those damnable plans, Herr Fredersen in the pockets of two men who met with an accident today at the M-Machine...
How is it, Josaphat, that these plans were brought to me by Grot, rather than by you?
Apply to the G-Bank for your remaining wages...
Father, do you know what it means to be dismissed by you?
―
It means:
To be sent below!
― Father ― below!
Into the Depths ― !
Do you know what it means to be dismissed like that by Joh Fredersen?
Would you like to come with me, Josaphat?
Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me...
I still have a long way to go tonight...
Into the Depths, ― to my brothers...
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed of my son's every move...
Brother the Machine!
I want to trade my life with you...
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.
Wait for me ― both of you...
Josaphat.
House 7, 7th Floor.
In the middle of Metropolis, there stands a strange house that the centuries had overlooked.
The man who dwelled within was Rotwang, the inventor.
Hel
Born to bring me happiness and a benediction to all mankind.
Lost to Joh Fredersen.
Died giving life to Freder, Joh Fredersen's son.
A mind like yours, Rotwang, should be able to forget...
Only one time in life did I forget something:
that Hel was a woman ― and you a man...
Let the dead lie, Rotwang...
She's dead for you as she is for me...
For me she isn't dead, Joh Fredersen ― for me she lives — !
Do you think the loss of a hand is too high a price for recreating Hel ― ?
Do you wish to see her ― ?
Now, Joh Fredersen ― ?
Isn't it worth losing a hand to have created the man of the future ― the Machine-Man — ?
24 more hours of work ― and no man, Joh Fredersen, will be able to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal ― !
The woman is mine, Joh Fredersen!
Hel's son was yours!
And what brings you my way, Joh Fredersen?
I need your advice ― as usual, when all my experts fail me...
Can you decipher for me these plans that for months have been getting discovered in the pockets of my workers?
...at two... once my shift ends!
She has summoned us again...
Father ― !
Father ― ! Will ten hours never come to an end ― ?
― it's a blueprint of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs deep below the lowest levels of your Metropolis...
I should like to glean what my workers are doing exactly in those catacombs...
Today I shall tell you the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TOWER OF BABEL...
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TOWER OF BABEL
Let us build a tower whose zenith shall reach unto the stars!
And at the tower's zenith we shall write:
Great is the world and its Maker!
And great is Man!
...but those who had conceived of the Tower of Babel could not build the Tower of Babel.
The task was too great.
So they paid wages to outside hands...
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel knew nothing of the dream of which the head that had conceived it had been fantasising.
The hymns of praise of one man became the curses of others.
The same language was spoken, but these men did not understand one another...
Great is the world and its Maker and great is Man
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator.
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!
And where is our Mediator, Maria ― ?
Wait for him!
He will surely come!
We will wait, Maria...!
But not for much longer ― !
Oh Mediator, have you finally come...
You summoned me ― here I am!
Rotwang, give the Machine-Man the likeness of this woman...
I shall sow discord between them and her!
I shall destroy their belief in this woman ―
Leave me alone now, Joh Fredersen...
You'll find the way back without me...
Now you shall also lose the last remaining thing you still had from Hel... your son...
Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!
END OF THE PRELUDE
INTERMEZZO
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit who preaches:
"Verily, I say unto you: the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh!"
The monk's hand points to the Bible, in which it is written:
"And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, having a golden cup in her hand.
And upon herforehead was a name written, a mystery:
BABYLON THE GREAT, the Mother of Abominations of the Earth.
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints."

Had you come earlier, you wouldn't have frightened me...
I now beg of you: stay away from me and my beloved...!
Where is the one whose clothes you are wearing?
Would you please wake Georgy up?
He must lead me to the Workers' City at once...
No. 11811, get back to the Machine and forget that you ever left it ― understood?
I have to have someone who's faithful to me, Josaphat, ― otherwise, how shall I attain the end-goal of my path ― ?
I must go on, Josaphat, ― must now, on my own, seek out the person to whom Georgy was supposed to lead me...
Tonight, Josaphat ― tonight when I come back...
So, what price are you demanding for leaving this residence tonight?
You still don't seem to have grasped who sent me here...
CENTRAL BANK OF METROPOLIS
This man doesn't want his son to find you still here tonight!
In three hours' time I shall be calling for you!
It is time to give the Man-Machine your face!
Where is Maria ― ?
She's with your father...
I'm telling you, she is with your father ― !
"She is the most perfect and most obedient tool that a man has ever possessed!
Tonight you shall see how she holds up before the eyes of the upper hundred.
You shall see her dance, and if only one single person recognises the machine in her, I will call myself a bungler who never succeeded at anything!
C. Rotwang"
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening."
I want you to go to those in the Depths in order to annihilate the work of your prototype!

END OF THE INTERMEZZO
The Revelation of St. John Avalun Publishing, Hellerau
I escaped from the Thin Man wearing this attire...
But for ten days your father's bloodhound has been making the Workers' City unsafe...
The only thing keeping the workers in check is their expectation for the Mediator promised unto them...
Even stranger things have been happening, Freder...
On that evening when you fell ill once the best of friends... because of that woman the other man... on that same evening the Eternal Gardens lie abandoned...
but night after night in Yoshiwara...
And this woman, at whose feet all sins are heaped is also called Maria...
That same woman that those in the Depths regard as a saint ― ?
Many now go to the City of the Dead, to a woman they have judged to be as true as gold.
The Mediator is not likely to miss that occasion...
Whatever happens tonight:
it is my express order to allow the workers to do as they please...
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them...
When you spoke to your poor brothers, you talked about peace, Maria... today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen incites them to rebel against him...
She will destroy their belief in the Mediator!
You know I've always talked about peace...
but your Mediator hasn't come...
You've waited long enough!
Your time has come ― !
...but I've tricked Joh Fredersen!
Your clone does not obey his will ― only mine alone!
Who is the living fodder for the machines for Metropolis ― ?
Who smears the machine-joints with their own marrow ― ?
Who feeds the machines with their own flesh ― ?
Let the machines starve, you fools ― !
Finish them off ― !
Do them in ― these machines ― !
You aren't Maria ― !
YOU ARE NOT MARIA ― !
Maria talks of peace, not murder ― !
This is not Maria ― !
Joh Fredersen's son ― !
Do him in, the dog, in his white silken hide ― !
Get your women, your sons, out of the Workers' City!
Let no-one stay behind!
Death to the machines ― !
In the attic of his home,
Rotwang displays for Maria his ever-growing intoxication with his triumph over Fredersen:
" ― and twice over did I trick Joh Fredersen ― !
For I concealed from him that his son wants to be the Mediator of your brothers ― and is in love with you ― !"
Maria isn't the only one listening to Rotwang.
On the other side of the attic's window, Joh Fredersen was eavesdropping...
Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him.
Maria is free.
...faithful after all...
Come, Freder!
We still have to go through the Workers' City.
Women and men, let no-one miss out on today ― !
Not one man ― not one woman has stayed behind ― !
Leave the machines ― !
Let them race to their death ― !
To the Heart-Machine ― !
You have to open the gates!
If the Heart-Machine perishes, nothing in the Machine-District will be left standing ― !
Have you lost your minds ― ?
If the Heart-Machine perishes, the entire Workers' City will be laid to waste ― !
Where are your fathers, your mothers?
Do you have any idea that your son is amongst the workers?
Yes ― you!
You're Maria ― !
To the air shafts ― quickly!
The reservoirs have burst!
The city is drowning ― !
We'll take the children to the Sons' Club!
Why are all the lights out?
I need to know ― !
Tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation:
Joh Fredersen, where is my son ― ?
The city is drowned, the shafts are totally flooded ― !
Who bade you attack the machines, without which you're finished, you idiots ― ?
It's the witch's fault ― !
We'll be looking on as the world goes to the devil ― !
Find the witch; this is all her fault ― !
Strike her dead ― !
Now I'm going to take you home, my Hel ― !
The witch ― !
the witch ― !
There she is ― !
there she is ― !
Where are our children, you witch, you ― ?
Burn the witch. ― To the stake with her!
To the stake with her ― !
Hel ― !
My Hel ― !
Your children... saved ― !
Head and hands want to join together, but they don't have the heart to do it...
Oh Mediator, show them the way to one another...

- HEALTH MEDICINE SHOW
The recent death of "Prof." Powers has left his daughter Mary with the problem of carrying on the medicine show.
Flash", I'm sorry I let you persuade me to keep on with the show.
Forget it, Mary.
It wouldn't be a show without you. Besides, everything's going to be O.K.
Sheriff Jim Hickory and his two oldest sons have made the family name famous throughout the country.
Harold, the youngest Hichory, was born on April Fool's Day.
The stork that brought him could hardly fly for laughing.
We'll be leaving for the meeting directly... how about my Sunday shirt?
If anything happens to that shirt, young man, I'll whale the life out of you.
Hank Hooper, Harold's sworn enemy ever since Harold sold him a dozen door knobs for fresh eggs in the dark.
Well, I see the town raised the money for the dam all right.
It will be a big thing for Hickoryville.
And a bigger thing for you... eh, Sheriff?
Son, how many times have I told you we don't want any more trouble with these Hickorys?
Where is this metropolis of Hickoryville... and who signs the permits for the shows there?
Sheriff Jim Hickory...
but he ain't got any use for medicine shows... he run the last one out of town.
You stay here, son... the town meeting's no place for boys.
Hi, Sheriff!
I've brought this show all the way from New York just to play your wonderful city.
Sheriff, I'd like you to autograph this little permit.
STOP! LOOK! LISTEN!

I appreciate your confidence, Mr. Chairman... and I'll write the State Treasurer tonight.
I'd rather see that much money in a real safe place.
You're hinting that it won't be safe with me?
I got some money in there...
and I don't want to see it... mislaid!
Keep back... or some-one might get hurt.
Mr. Hickory, I...
Who told you my name?
Every one n the state knows the Hickory and I'm proud to have met the man who made the Hickory name famous.
You mean my father and brothers.
You're modest...
but I like you for it.
What's your name?
Where do you live?
With the Medicine Show... down by the river.
Goodbye!"
This is a great day for Hickoryville...

Hickoryville May 6 State Treasurer:
The Hickoryville citizens have collected their share for the dam and it is now in my keeping.
We are now waiting further instructions from you regarding the dam money.
Respectfully Sheriff Jim Hickory
How does that sound to you?
Now you boys can sign it.
Goin' to the show?
That big medicine show in the village.
Who gave them permission to play here?
I thought I'd mail our letter.
Did you give them permission?
As you seem to be taking over the duties of sheriff... go down and stop the show.
This medicine is not only good for man and beast but is recommended as a furniture polish and for cleaning harness.
My father sent me down to stop the show...
if you don't mind.
Now folks, on the count of three, this trick will prove that the little sheriff is out of sight.
Now folks, we will again be entertained by our little beauty!
If you don't stop the show, I'll have you arrested.
Where's your authority?
One moment, Sheriff, I've got a little present for you... first.
I'm giving you 24 hours to get out of here!
I'll get the key, Mr. Hickory...
The kid is as much at fault as anybody.
I'll attend to him when we get home.
Will these do for tonight?
Would you get me a glass of water, please?
Wouldn't you rather have some hot coffee?
Me and mama have come to take the girl home.
She can't stay here where there's no womenfolks.
It ain't decent.
I suppose I'd better go.
Will you go with me to the celebration for the dam tomorrow?
Good night, Mary...
I'm going to sleep in the barn.
Next morning...

Where's that Harold?

The girl from the medicine show came home with him.
She's asleep in the parlor.
I'm going to fetch you some breakfast.
Everything all right, miss?
Here's your breakfast, Miss.
Get to work... that boy Harold does more work than both of you.
...and if you fellows ever try anything like that again, I won't let you off so easy.
I'm earning my board at the Hoopers' by helping with the housework.
I'll get my wraps.
You go in and get her wraps... I want to speak to her a moment.
The older he grows. the worse he gets.
You boys better get dressed for the celebration.
Come on, you're going with me to the celebration.
If you don't go with me, you won't go with anybody.
The money for the dam has been stolen!
All I know is... I found the strong box open and the money gone.
Some one broke into your house, opened the box... and you didn't hear nothing?
It sounds funny to me...
Haven't you any clue, Jim?
GIGANTE DR. PODERES MEDICINE SHOW FREE
I just got an idea who did this and I'm going out and get them.
We ain't satisfied with your goin' and I reckon you better stay here till we are.
Then I'll deputize my sons.
Boys, it's those two fellows with the medicine show. Bring them back here.
Son, you get hurt.
This is a man's job.
Harold, aren't you going with your brothers?
You see... my father and brothers don't reckon much on me...
and I guess they're right
I'm not what you think I am. I was just pretending.
But you can be what I think you are...
without pretending.
...and no matter what anybody else thinks, have confidence in yourself and you can't lose.
Do you really believe in me?
There's that girl from the medicine show...

Among the vacationists was a Woman of the City.

"Couldn't she get drowned?
"...then overturn the boat... it will look like an accident."
"Leave this behind... come to the City!"
"Come to the City!"
"...after the boat has capsized, save yourself with these bulrushes."
"The rushes will hold you up.
Scatter them before you reach the shore and tell everyone she drowned by accident."
"We're going for a trip across the water.
I may not be back for quite a while."
"Don't be afraid of me!"
"God is giving you, in the holy blonds of matrimony, a trust.
She is young... and inexperienced.
Guide her and love her..."
"...keep and protect her from all harm."
"Wilt thou LOVE her?"
"Forgive me!"
"Manicure?"

The Unknown
This is a story they tell in old Madrid it's a story they say is true.
"You all know me Antonio Zanzi... and my gypsy circus..."
"...and now, the sensation of sensations!
The wonder of wonders!
ALONZO, THE ARMLESS!"
"Assisting Alonzo in this death-defying act, is my daugter... NANON!"
MALABAR THE MIGHTY.
"You are right, Alonzo brute strength does not mean everything to all women".
"Alonzo, all my life men have tried to put their beastly hands on me to paw over me".
"I have grown so that I shrink with fear when any man even touches me".
"You are wise, Nanon.
Always fear them... always hate them".
"And remember I am always near you ready to help you".
"If it takes ten million years, Nanon I will keep saying 'I love you' until you believe me".
"No one will get her no one but me!"
"See, Nanon!
Eyes that adore you hands that long to caress you and strength to protect you!"
"Why do you always draw away from me?"
"Why isn't he different from other men!
Why doesn't he keep his hands of me?"
"Hands!
Men's hands!
How I hate them!"
"Men! The beasts!
God would show wisdom if he took the hands from all of them!"
"Forgive me, Alonzo I did not mean you".
"You are the one man I can come to without fear".
"She is with Alonzo again!
Are you afraid to deal with him?"
"Putting crazy ideas in her head again!
I'll settle this!"
"A thousand thanks, Malabar.
I will try to repay same day".
"You have Nanon in your heart, haven't you?"
"In my heart... in my soul in my blood!"
"You are fortunate.
You have arms and strength that she loves".
"Go take her in your arms and let her listen to the song of your blood".
"Cojo... I said no one is going to have her!
No one but me!"
"There is a time for fear, Nanon and a time for hate and a time for love".
"You worry, Alonzo, that sometime will find out you have arms?"
"What would the police give to know I have hands and who I am?"
"There they are, Cojo and Zanzi may be another to find how I have them".
"I have been waiting for you... to teach you that my orders are law!"
"Stop them!
They've burned enough clothes to keep twenty gypsy souls out of hell!"
"The same hands that strangled Zanzi where this circus played!
They're somwehere in this troupe!"
"Get your finger-prints taken!"
"What will happen, Alonzo if they sell the circus to pay my father's debts?"
"Do not worry, Nanon, I promised your father I would always take care of you".
"The circus has gone... every caravan.
Why did we not travel with them, Alonzo?"
"Because I want to take you away from the things you hate, Nanon".
"I could not go away without telling you again that I will love you always".
"I am so sorry Malabar put his hand on you again... so sorry".
"Cojo, did you see her?
She kissed me!"
"You must never let her touch... you that way again".
"She will feel that you have arms!"
"Cojo will never tell!"
"There is nothing I will not do to own her!
Nothing... do you understand?
Nothing!"
"You are a riddle, Nanon.
You shrink from me... yet you kiss my flowers when I am gone".
"Then if you do care for me, why won't you ever let me hold you in my arms?"
"I know now what you fear".
"Some day that fear will die.
You will find me near you always...waiting... loving hoping".
"Cojo, I've got to have her!
She has got to marry me!"
"No Alonzo!
On your wedding night she would see your arms....and hate you!"
"No, Cojo....she would never hate me... she would forgive me".
"But you forget....she saw her father strangled by a hand with two thumbs".
"You are forgetting that you have arms!"
"No, no Alonzo!
Not that!
Never do that!"
Leave the door to the operating room open and be there at midnight - alone.
Remember Algiero, 20 years ago!
"Why this letter... and who are you?"
"You're here to backmail me!
It's money you want!"
"Well....what is the price of your silence about my past?"
"And be careful that I do not die in this operation.... because I left a letter telling who you are".
"I am afraid any more, Malabar.
All my foolish fears are gone".
"You're recovering rapidly.
You'll be able to leave in a few weeks".
"But we must wait until Alonzo returns.
I want him with us at our wedding".
"Perhaps the landlady knows where she is.
Go ask, Cojo".
"But it's strange I've never heard from Alonzo... not one word since he went away".
"The landlady says she is at that theatre on the plaza".
"You are thinner, Alonzo!
Have you been sick?"
"No not sick... but I have lost some flesh".
"How is Cojo?
You love him best of anyone, don't you?"
"No, Nanon... not best".
"I am happy you have returned Alonzo, now we can be married".
"Oh...
You have been away.
I well call him".
"Has Nanon told you the good news,
Alonzo?"
"Remember how I used to be afraid of his hands?"
"I am not any more.
I love them now".
"Alonzo is laughing at the way everything has happened".
"I did what you told me, Alonzo.
I took her in my arms..."
"I'm all right now".
"It was just something in here that stung like the lash of a whip".
"They said you were rehearsing.
Is this your rigging!"
"See... I have a horse hitched to each hand and they pull in opposite directions".
"You see, when the horses are tugging he could not let go if he wanted to".
"It's very dangerous.
Suppose the treadmills broke or stopped suddenly".
"If that happens the horses would tear my arms from my body".
"Do not say that!
You make Alonzo worry that something will happen to you".
"Do not worry, Alonzo... Nothing will happen.
We have been rehearsing for weeks".
"I couldn't reach Nanon's robe.
Will you get it for me?"
So... for Alonzo there was an end Hate called Death... and for Nanon, an end to Hate... called Love.

But we couldn't have him in here with us.
There's never room for three.
I'm a little damp so I'll go home..
I'm sorry you got so wet.

Pretty short war!
I guess I forgot to put film in the camera.
Say, how did you get wise to that Tong War?
Miss Sally told me.
Did you give him the tip, young lady?
It's all your fault that this fool has been hanging around here!
Don't leave me because of me.
I'll never bother any of your again.
Tueasday morning.ý The Westport Yacht Club Regatta
Did you change this film box in Chinatown?
Look out you don't get thrown out when I make this turn.
You're awfully brave to have saved me.
What else could a fellow do?
Wednesday morning.
That little cameraman left this film here.
He said you can have it for nothing.
It's the Tong War!
That's the best camera work I've seen in years!
Get that man here quick!
I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Everybody talking about you!
They're all waiting to give you a great reception!
THE CIRCUS
"So you missed the hoop again."
"Father, I couldn't help it."
"For that you don't eat tonight."
"And you're supposed to be funny!"
"Look at that house; empty!"
Around the Side Shows hungry and broke.
"Here you are, sir."
"Count it."
"Is it all there?"
"Say, gimme that money!"
"How d'you get out of here?"
"Rotten!"
"Get off!"
"Where's the funny man?"
"Bring on the funny man!"
The Funny Man.
Meal-time after the Show.
"Father won't let me."
"Do you want a job?"
"Be here in the morning, and we'll try you out."
Early the next morning.
"Run along home!"
"I live here."
"Excuse me, my cane."
The Tryout.
"Go ahead and be funny."
"That's awful!"
"Put on the William Tell act."
"Now then, watch this and see if you can do it."
"Go ahead and try it."
"Put on the barber-shop act."
"Now I must hit you."
"Now hit me!"
"I can't see."
"Just a moment!"
"We haven't talked terms yet."
"Get out and stay out!"
"Show's starting!"
"Aren't you coming in?"
"You're not leaving?"
"You see, we couldn't come to terms."
"Thank you for the egg."
The Show on.
Trouble with the Property Men.
"How about our back pay?"
"Get to work!"
"We quit!"
"They've quit."
"Get anybody!"
"Don't touch that button!"
"He's a sensation, but he doesn't know it."
"Keep him on as a property man."
The Circus prospered, but not the property man. And the girl led the same hard life.
"Keep him busy and don't let him know he's the hit of the show."
A Sick Horse.
"Blow this pill down the horse's neck!"
"The horse blew first --"
"Open the door, quick!"
"I told you the lions were dangerous!"
"Where's that pill?"
"Come here!"
"I've got to see a doctor!"
"It's a shame the way they make you work --" "And you the hit of the show."
"Why of course!"
"All the crowds, all the applause is just for you."
"I knew it!"
"If you strike that girl, I'll quit!"
"And what's more I want what I'm worth --"
"I'll give you fifty dollars a week."
"Sixty!"
"I'll double it!"
"Nothing less than a hundred."
The Next Show.
The success of the Tramp made life easier for the girl and himself.
"Oh, Merna, you must have your fortune told!"
"I see love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now."
A New Added Attraction, Rex, a tight-rope walker.
"Pardon me."
"Go right ahead."
"I'll give you Five Dollars for it."
"It's happened;
I'm in love!"
"He's a tight-rope walker." "I've just met him."
"Hurry up, you're on!"
The Act Over.
"What's the matter?"
"You hardly got a laugh!"
"This is my friend."
"I don't like tight-rope walkers."
Time brought many changes to the Circus;
New Hopes and New Ambitions.
His New Ambition.
"Never mind the rope."
"You'd better try and be funny again or you'll go!"
The next performance- and not a smile.
"I've had enough of this;"
"You get one more chance."
"Where's Rex?"
"Rex, the tight-rope walker, hasn't shown up."
"Is Rex here?"
"You can do the act, can't you?"
"You'll do it or quit!"
"I'll do it;
find his clothes!"
"There's the clothes!"
"You follow her!"
"He'll kill himself."
"That's all right;"
"I've got him insured."
"Take your time, there's another act to go on."
"Why, what is the meaning of this?"
"I am taking his place on the rope."
"You'll get killed."
"Oh, no, I have a charmed life."
"I'll give you five dollars if you'll do it."
"Not a word to anybody."
"Please don't do this."
"You've forgotten your tights."
"You're on!"
"You're through!"
That Night.
"I've run away from the circus."
"I'll never go back."
"Can't you take me with you?"
"I've got an idea."
"You stay here."
"Have you seen Merna?"
"She's run away --"
"I can do nothing for her -- --"
"Now, there's one way out."
"She's there now?"
"Take me to her!"
The Next Morning.
The Circus ready to leave.
"So you've come back - - You -- !"
"You're speaking to my wife!"
"Will you go on with the show?"
"-- -- if you take him."
"The end wagon for you."
"Come in with us."
THE FARMER'S WIFE
...and don't forget to spread those your master's pants, Minta
He will be the next one in marrying now that he/she makes it their daughter
.Y why not?
in the marriage there is something magic... he/she has their beautiful side, Chudles Ash
To drink beer doesn't weaken the lover's arms
If I was the Government he/she would leave alone to the drunkards and it would watch over the lovers
I have seen the master put their eyes in an or two women lately
.Ver to an old one in love it is worse than to do it with tosferina!
The sacred marriage is a prepared road roller... to squash the hope of a man and the happiness of a woman
...and many of those that are here, often, compa.ía wants and necesitán to a man strong in who to lean on
Now don't forget, dear Sr. Sweetland, to come to my peque.a meeting next Thursday .y would rot Sr. Ash to be in the door and to announce to the companies?
...I have a livery that could put on
I need time to make me to the idea, Minta, but soon I will be a loner
My dear deceased's last desire Tibby, was that arrived the moment... he/she took another... but her he/she didn't mention any name
There are an or two women floating in my mind as the aroma of a Sunday meal
.Coja paper and pencil, Minta, and we will see the pros and contras!
.Usted knows it, see from behind don't look more than thirty!
But, you will live with her of front
Does he find .Qué Thirza Tapper?
I don't worry about padded women... whenever they are he in the appropriate parts
.Una woman that seems a pillow at the thirty, frequently it will be a mattress of feathers at the forty!
Aim Mercy Bassett of Royal Oak, just in case
There is something indecent, seeing them to all in a paper piece
Not it is necessary to wish me luck Louisa Windeatt will come as a lamb to the slaughter
.La widow in person!
.Qué makes him/her ascend to my hill, Sweetland?
I come as the foxes, you are so tender...
.a to choose a thick hen!
Wait to hear me... and then we will have reason to drink
I will marry again, Louisa
Then .la thick hen that wants... is it for the nuptial breakfast?
"Yes" it is a word very brief
"But there is another shorter one...
"Not I am their woman type, I am too independent
It would only feel a silk glove never my authority
.No thinks that it returns to to go up their damned hill!
And in this matter, its behavior has not been the characteristic of a lady...
neither fairly pleasant
And don't change opinion... he/she has decided their own destination
Not leave that that old junk, the leather jacket of foxes,
Louisa Windeatt, enter to this house again
...and of course I will like to see it.
Not forget that the party it begins at 4 o'clock on the dot. Sincerely his. Thirza Tapper
It is very kind on the other hand to come to help us, Minta... and also you, Sr. Ash
"The party doesn't have still begun, Se.or."
.Entonces prefers him to serve the plums before the ice creams?
Now the men look for women something padded...
Understand it, Thirza Tapper, .te is proposing marriage!
...I am a man to which a ni.ito would rot to take, but to the one that neither a regiment...
Get up, lover Samuel Sweetland
.Es the first man that there is picked up the glove of my sexual challenge!
But I will never look for refuge in the arms of a man... not even in his
.Cómo went that is that the ice creams they would melt next to the fire!
.No participates in the party, George!
Here the doctor is and their wife
It is all so perfect one as in a cafeteria of the railroad
Their excellence the parish priest, and their mother... Honoroble Missus
.Deben to be the singers of the choir!
Please, those that have finished, they want to leave to the garden
Fruit... fruit in the garden, please
Mary Hearn, I go to to marry again
Amusing .Es, a fortune-teller told me that I would marry before an a.o!
.Apuesto to that I will be able to to tell him/her who he is!
.Usted...
you, to their age!
Good, .no will want to marry with a boy, truth?
.Porqué not?
It is usually how they marry the girls, with boys, is .no this way?
.Se dares to be considered "a girl?"
.Entonces of what bitchy way I should call?
Very inflated and not very prepared... .Asi is as me I call it!
Their problem is that it delights him/her to get dressed like a young boy
Is .Esto a nightmare?
Their hat is it
Green .Viejo! ...
To go to one woman in their fullness and beauty
! Not believe that it has been first o'clock, because it has not been it!
.Ángeles and demons! , Does .qué make Sammy to the Boss of Mail?
.Pero, what it was making, Sammy?
Not I will pursue more women.
Not I will finish the list
I believe that Mercy Bassett of the one Royal Oak, will be as the other ones
I am embarrassed of Samuel Sweetland, offering in sale for the whole region
It is sad for us, the men, that he/she crawls, hat in hand... .sólo so that their griefs be object of laughs!
.Ensilla my horse!

We understand each other, I believe that you are in love
We draw crisscross hearts.
True works teachers, as round and white as the chests of a woman!
After their scandalous behavior not I want to speak with you... more than the "official thing"
No man should put it so gray hysterical, insignificant rat!
Know that, I could have been a wife... the wife of the one worthier and more intelligent man, Sr. Samuel Sweetland
Demonstrate it Tabby Tapper
...and it would bet that if it doesn't get it, he/she will return very gotten worked up, .recuérdalo!
Everything finished, Minta Finished .Estoy!
I always had to escape with the tail among legs
All the power of the feminine sex is in my against.
They have taken off the self-esteem
Not say that, Sweetland.
Not I want to listen to a strong and sensitive man to speak this way
.De what those are made women nowadays?
I have made many errors, Minta, but it is still something good in me
That is enough to weaken their faith in all us
.Creí that to be se.ora of the farm it would tempt them, since the farmer not!
There is a woman that is pleasant, Jane Cherry, the hawker's sister
There is a woman...
a woman...
Not believe that it will anger me, if he/she "not" says.
I am ense.ado to "not listen"
I offer humble as a worm.
I don't have left hope, but I would like to say a single thing in my favor... a ni.ito could take me
Sure .Está of what says?
It is an unexpected risk
Same Se.or acts as the lightning and it doesn't warn when he/she goes he/she is necessary to wake up the trial in the heart of a man
I will be proud of undertaking it, Samuel, to undertake it with trust and it thrills
If you regret this additional work, then I can lose my salvation
And now so that the change is noticed, you should become this instant
.Dónde that dressed daring person is of party that my Tibby gave you?
.Ha caught a woman after everything?
God helps you and me...
.pensar in another woman in this house!
They say that the best thing after being single he/she is a good wife.
He has triumphed at the end
I will be of their part, Minta. I will help her to manage it
Not forget to tell him/her that I have a pay cruelly low
I have changed to seem, Samuel
I joust now he/she will say him/her to Mary something important
Not forget to leave to Tabby Tapper to hear it
I have heard speak of your sad history, Samuel, and I have something for you... I deign so much dish for one party like for a funeral one
I have made my election, .y will stay to drink for her!
And if somebody knows a woman with a more gentile heart a more spotless past and a nobler character. I would like to see it
Emil Jannings in Josef von Sternberg's
Hollywood - 1928!
The Magic Empire of the Twentieth Century!
The Mecca of the World! To this Hollywood had come Leo Andreyev, a Russian director ...
"Every Russian in Hollywood is in that stack!"
Sergius Alexander Claims to have been commanding general of Russian Army and cousin to Czar.
Little film experience -- Works for $7.50 a day.
"Have him report to work tomorrow morning ..."
"... and fit him into a General's uniform!"
"The Eureka Studio calling ..."
"Six tomorrow morning ... studio gate!"
The Bread Line of Hollywood.
"Quit your shoving'!
Who do you think you are?"
"One Corporal!"
"One General!"
"Quit shaking' your head!
How do you expect me to make up?"
"Excuse me, please ... I can't help it ... I ...
"Where'd you get the gadget from ... steal it out of a hock shop?"
"The Czar gave it to me."
"What do you know about that?
The Czar gave him this beautiful medal!"
"I'm your pal ...
I want to show it to everybody ..."
Imperial Russia - 1917.
Proud, majestic, haughty ...
seemingly eternal at the ages!
On a dozen far-flung battle fronts, Russia was engaged in a death grapple with the enemy.
Tireless in the defense of a crumbling empire was the Grand Duke Sergius Alexander, cousin to the Czar and Commanding General of the Russian Armies.
"Everything is in perfect order, Your Imperial Highness There is no need for you to tire yourself with an inspection."
"The revolutionists have intercepted most of our supplies."
"Let him strut a little longer!
His day are numbered!"
"The days of all who are dragging Russia down are numbered!"
"Only a few weeks more ... but they seem an eternity!"
"We have waited too long to be impatient now!"
"You are ordered to report for passport examination in the morning."
"They are actors playing for the troops and their pasports are in order but our reports show they are revolutionists ..."
"... she is Natalie Dabrova, the most dangerous revolutionist in Russia!"
"Let's have them up!
He's dangerous enough and she's pretty enough ... to merit my personal attention!"
"The second time this week you've worn my coat and smoked my cigarettes!"
"If he does it again remove the coat and shoot the contents!"
"So you two are serving your country ... by acting!"
"A fine patriotic service... when Russia is fighting for her life!"
"Why aren't you in uniform?"
"My lungs are weak."
"Perhaps it is your courage that is weak!"
"It doesn't require courage to send others to battle and death!"
"Put him under arrest!"
"What is this man to you?"
"Nothing at all.
He is Leo Andreyev ... the director of the Kief Imperial Theatre."
"Orders from the General Staff, Your Imperial Highness!"
"You will, of course, honor us with your company?"
The new Headquarters.
HIS MAJESTY THE CZAR WILL VISIT YOUR HEADQUARTERS THIS AFTERNOON TO INSPECT THE TROOPS
"Recall a division from the front His Majesty thinks the war is a parlor game."
"We can't spare a division...
we need every man!"
"Don't argue!
Have a division deloused and re-equipped... and send it here immediately!"
And so, with the flames of war crackling along a two-thousand mile front, troops bitterly needed to defend Russia played parade for the Czar.
"Your Imperial Highness, you are urgently needed to dispatch instructions!"
"The show will be over in a minute!"
"Russia relies on you, dear cousin."
After a week ... after thousands of men had spilled their blood to defend a few inches of earth ...
"Where is the lady?"
"I beg you to accept this expession of gratitude for your company."
"That sort of thing should always be done after caviar!"
"The General Staff, Your Imperial Highness!"
"Hiss Majesty plans to visit the front tomorrow!
It might be advisable to stage an offensive for him in the morning ... not too early!"
"My troops are not prepared for an offensive!
... ... I will not sacrifice them merely for the entertainment of the Czar!"
"That's what provides fuel for the revolution!"
"Can't you see the man is very ill?"
"I'll show you dirty revolutionary dogs!"
"Aren't you taking a terrific risk in defying the Czar's wishes?"
"I would take any risk to prevent a needless sacrifice."
"Then why do you continue this stupid war?"
"We must have victory!
... ... Defeat means revolution ... and the collapse of Russia!"
"Then you love Russia so much?"
"I would gladly die tonight ... if it would help Russia!"
"Before you die ... won't you at least have coffee with me ... in my room?"
"You are very beautiful!
One could easily fall in love with you!"
"Your hand is trembling!"
"Will you get me my cigarettes, please?
Yours are so strong!"
"Why didn't you shoot?"
"I don't know why I didn't kill you ..."
I suppose it was because I couldn't kill ... anyone who loves Russia as much as you do!"
"From now on you are my prisoner of war ..."
"... and my prisoner of love."
A group of obscure people meet to decide the fate of Russia.
"Train Number 476, carrying the Grand Duke Sergius Alexander and staff, has left for the front!"
"Communicate with our agents at once!
Tonight Russia becomes a republic!"
"If we get the right news at the next station His Imperial Highness will long remember this ride!"
"His Imperial Highness will be here in five minutes!
... ... Let's give him the greatest reception he has ever had!"
"All out, Masters of Russia!
Last stop!"
"People of Russia... you are being led by traitors!"
"We have been slaves too long!
Now we are the masters!"
"I'll be your servant just once more!
... ... I'll place the noose around your neck myself!"
"This is the end, Your Imperial Highness It is our turn now!"
"Let's hang him in Petrograd... for all the world to see!"
"Look at him!
...
The greatest man in Russia greatest even than the Czar!"
"Make him sweat as we have sweated!
... ... Make him stoke our train to Petrograd!"
"Would His Imperial Highness care for one of his cigarettes?"
"To the locomotive!"
"That woman belongs to me ... she goes with the coat!"
"Don't you understand?
It was the only way I could save your life."
"I love you!"
"These pearls will pay your way out of Russia!"
"I love you! I love you!"
And so the backwash of a tortured nation had carried still another extra to Hollywood.
"Get the extra people on the stage!"
"The director has an important part for you, Pop.
You've got to look nice!"
"Is that beard supposed to be Russian?
It looks like an ad for cough drops!"
"In Russia, that was worn on the left side.
I know because I was a general."
"I've made twenty Russian pictures.
You can't tell me anything about Russia!"
"Get me a whip!"
"I have waited ten years for this moment, Your Imperial Highness."
"The same coat, the same uniform, the same man only the times have changed!"
"This is supposed to be a trench scene of troops just before a battle ..."
"You are the General in command!"
"The troops are tired of war ... tired of listening to our pretty speeches ..."
"One of them becomes violent ... you strike him with this whip!"
"We won't have to rehearse that scene ...
I know you can use a whip!"
"Music please ... the Russian National Anthem."
"Wind machine!"
"Lights!"
"Camera!"
"What's the difference who wins this war?
... We're sick and tired of fighting ..."
"You've given your last command!
A new day is here!
Down with your Russia!
"People of Russia, you are being led by traitors we must win or Russia will perish!"
"The command is forward ... to victory ..."
"Long Live Russia!"
"Have we won?"
"Yes, Your Imperial Highness ... you have won!"
"Tough luck!
That guy was a great actor."
"He was more than a great actor ... he was a great man."

Fritz Lang's SPIONE was restored between 2003 and 2004 by the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung.
As no original negative exists, various nitrate copies were used.
Due to its length and excellent condition, a copy from the Národni Filmovy Archiv, Prague, formed the restoration's basis.
Problematic scenes were replaced using materials supplied by Filmarchiv Austria and Screensound
Moscow's Gosfilmofond's dupe negative contained a complete set of intertitles displayed as flashtitles.
These matched the original intertitles found in part within the Austrian nitrate copy.
The original German opening credits sequence has not survived.
Cast and crew details were culled from the censor card and rendered in the same graphics as the intertitles.

Are the officials in charge of state security so asleep on the job that our most important documents and secret files can vanish without a trace?

From: Minister of the Interior To:
M.B. Jason, Head of Secret Service By messenger
Dear Mr. Jason!
Enclosed please find several new caricatures and opinions expressed by the public concerning your department...
Isn't it time to bring this ridicule of the helplessness of the Secret Service to an end? The Minister of the Interior.
"What's the use of all your precautions in bringing me here when I am secretly photographed by one of your staff in your own office...?"
"Who's paying you... you scoundrel - to inform on me...?
"I'd sooner die like a dog than become a traitor!"
"Your fate is in your hands, Vincent...
Who are you working for?"
"Find out for yourself!
And may God have mercy on you if you find him!"
"Who is he talking about -? !"
"If I knew, No. 326, I wouldn't need you!
And the public wouldn't be making a laughing stock of us!"
"It's easy for you to laugh because, fortunately for you, you prevented your picture falling into the hands of this... damned spy...!"
"... and no one knows what this man looks like -? !"
"A few... people have known... but... "
"I would be sorry, No. 326, if I had to put a cross after your name as well... "
The Enemy...
"Copy photos 4 and 6...
Distribute to all members of the surveillance squad!"
His headquarters...
Morrier kidnapped from the gallows.
Sensational act prior to execution.
"This time, Morrier, I have saved you from the noose, because I can make good use of scoundrels like you...
But if ever I sign your death sentence... "
"I am a scoundrel, sir - but a grateful one... "
is on her way to the Haghi Bank.
"Miss Barranikowa shall report to me immediately when she returns from Colonel Jellusic. "
Colonel Jellusic, a man of interest to many people...
"Are there letters under this box number waiting for me?"
"What box number did this man just pick up letters from?"
"Pardon, Lady Leslane, General Director Haghi would like to see you... it will only take two minutes... a formality... as milady just happens to be here... "
"I would like to make a proposal, Lady Leslane!"
"I would like to find out from you, as the wife of Roger Leslane, when and where the Japanese Secret Treaty will be signed... and who will be present!"
"If I hear nothing within 48 hours, in the 49th hour your husband will find out just where his wife spends her Tuesday and Friday evenings... "
"Your efforts are futile, Lady Leslane,
- I have the negative... "
"I'm richer than Ford, Lady Leslane, even if I pay significantly less in taxes. "
"How far have you gotten with Jellusic? !"
"I've got him eating out of my hand!
And for a kiss he'd sell me all his fortresses and the entire army of his country!"
"You know what you have to do.
I expect a report tonight!"
"Save me - I shot him -!"
"... he invited me to come see him... about a tour... he... he tried to force me...
I didn't know what to do - so I shot him!"
"If you really want to help me... just let me leave!"
It will be better for you and for me... if we never see each other again!
"Choose whomever you wish for this project
- but keep me out of it!
I don't want to work against this man... "
"He reminds me...
of my brother Sascha... "
"All the more reason for you to fight our enemies in the form of this man, enemies who also were the enemies of your father, of your brother, or... "
"Have you forgotten -? !"
...sentenced to death
"They died innocent, two victims of the Ochrana of your Russian Czar -"
"... because they weren't smart enough to keep their thoughts to themselves!"
"My friend... "
My friend!
- I must see you again... - "
"Don't tell me you've fallen in love with this fellow -?"
My friend!
I owe you an explanation and must see you again!
Come tomorrow at 4.00 to have... a glass of real Russian tea - with the woman you saved
The Diary as Lifesaver
so that you will cry no more.
"I am so happy - so happy -!"
"I, too... "
"My friend... "
"In memory of my father and my brother... they died as victims of the Czarist Ochrana... "
"But, is there nothing at all that you want -? !"
"Final Edition -!"
"Make me a gift of this evening!"
"I'll pick you up at 9 o'clock - we'll go to Danielli - all right?"
"Wear it forever - it shall bring you luck!"
"At 12 o'clock sharp everyone is at his post... "
Go immediately to J. H.
Pay Jellusic the price demanded in exchange for all the mobilization plans in his possession.
Under the condition that he cross the border tonight.
You will not return home, but will report to me immediately.
"The condition is that you have to cross the border tonight... "
"But the night is still young, my lovely Sonja... and you had promised... "
"The documents... "
A farewell kiss, beautiful Sonja...!"
A cavalier does not betray his lady!"
"Drive home!"
"Are you satisfied now -?"
"So you love the young man?"
"Your house has been cleared out - you will live at headquarters and not leave your room without my permission-"
"If the Barranikowa woman had not once again been warned in time,
I would have raided her house tonight!"
"You are hardly the first to have fallen into the trap of this master spy. "
Nothing is to deter a man from the path of duty... not even a woman... "
"Why don't you go home, my child?"
"Please, let me stay here!
Don't send me away again!
I won't take up any more space than a little dog...!"
"Have I offended you?
Must I leave again?"
"When I went looking for the fellow early this morning, he had already decamped...
without a trace!"
"I'll show you pictures of all the people suspected of being spies that were taken over the last month... "
"Colonel Jellusic left this morning at 2.40 on the Orient Express!"
"I'll have this man watched by one of our agents as soon as he arrives. "
"A plane leaves in 45 minutes that will arrive down there two hours after the Orient Express. "
The Secret Service reserves two seats on the Aero Orient Express.
"People like Jellusic can be had for money...!
If I offer him enough he'll betray those who are paying him!"
"Jellusic has to be put out of commission.
Denounce him as a spy to his Commander in Chief at General Headquarters!"
"Good evening, Herr Jellusic... "
"So you don't deny...?"
"You are granted one last request, Herr Jellusic... "
"I beg - in all - humility... "
Surveillance Report Re:
Signing of the Japanese Secret Agreement.
Location:
Small conference room of the Japanese Embassy.
Time: 5:30 a. m.
Present:
The two treaty parties, and Chief of Secret Service Dr. Matsumoto.
The Embassy will be subject to the most stringent security measures.
"I'll have this treaty in my hands tonight!"
"Gentlemen!
One of these envelopes contains the most important treaty
Japan has concluded in a century... "
"You'll take three different routes to Tokyo...
Whoever does not deliver his letter with its seal unbroken is not worthy of being called a Japanese!"
"Whose blood am I to wear around my neck, Haghi?"
"I have called you in order to clear things between you and me, Sonja. "
"Where is - he -?
"He's trying to trace you through Jellusic. "
SUDDEN DEATH OF COLONEL M.O. JELLUSIC
As we learned after press time, Jellusic, colonel extraordinaire at General Headquarters, has died of a heart attack shortly after returning from a holiday trip.
"20,000 pounds... in new bank notes - with consecutive serial numbers...!"
"A blank telegram, please!"
Find out immediately to whom the State Bank has issued notes in denominations of one thousand with consecutive numbers 0319726 to 0319745 stop Return with next flight.
"A special operator call...!"
"What -?
! The bank note numbers?
"You have to make up your mind, Sonja.
Are you on my side - against him?"
"You still don't seem to know what I am capable of!"
"I have other irons in the fire... "
"I will come back, my child
- the house shall be yours... you will live there as a little princess... "
"I have to leave, Kitty...!"
"But not so fast - !
Not so fast -!
Just a few more hours -!
A few meagre hours... -!"
"Don't you see that I will die - if you leave me -?"
"As surely as I shall win this battle, Sonja, I will defeat him...
Do you nevertheless stick to your decision?
"And how long are you planning to keep me prisoner?"
"Until one of us is the victor, Sonja - he or I!"
"No. 326, who is coming back tonight, has sent us a radiogram that falls into your field of expertise... "
"Read it for yourself!
This matter has to be taken care of before No. 326 returns!"
Find out immediately to whom the State Bank has issued notes in denominations of one thousand...
"So I'll come tonight with No. 326 to your dressing room!"
"I'll take care of the postal censorship
- You see to it that all borders are closed!
If the treaty falls into the wrong hands, the war in the East is all but declared!"
"It's the last car - and it will happen in the tunnel... if No. 326 falls into the trap"
"I have told you, Sonja, you will be free when one of us two men triumphs... "
"It is I who have been conquered... because I need you!"
"No one but you is skilful enough to bring the photos of the treaty across the closed border...
Do me this one last service - and the road to the man you love will be open!"
"And you swear that he will be safe from you in the future if I say yes -?"
"I believe they'll use a foreigner to take the stolen treaty across the border
- and the sudden departure of the Russian courier is, at the very least, suspicious... "
"... the more so now that 719 has determined that the bank notes for Jellusic also came from Russian hands... "
"Unfortunately, I cannot leave here without destroying my cover and jeopardizing my work as No. 719
- but in any event I have reserved the sleeping compartment next to that of the Russian courier... "
"Around 6 a. m.
You will cross the border - that is the decisive moment!"
"I almost forgot what I found the other day... "
"The last car of the express train... - crashed in the tunnel... - "
"You wretch - !
Did Haghi send you to make sure that his damned plan was successful
"You don't intend to betray us, do you... you scoundrel...?"
"Attention - Central - Central - Central...!"
"Attention - Central - Central
- Central...! No. 326 is alive -!
Sonja has betrayed us -!"
"We wish to talk to Director Haghi. "
"Gentlemen, what could the police be looking for here -?"
"A criminal - and the proof of his crime!"
"I order you to hand over to me the keys to all of the bank safes!"
"You have fourteen minutes to live, Sonja!
- if he chooses not to obey me!"
"People's lives - in danger -!
The bank must be searched within 13 minutes, and Haghi's secret room found - do you understand?
... - "
"Burn all papers...
dynamite the safes...
In ten minutes the bank will be filled with gas!"
"Soon, Sonja, you will know all about the secrets of death
- take with you a secret from my life!"
"The bank has been searched down to the foundations
- there is no trace of a secret exit. "
"Gas -!"
"Where is Haghi -?"
10,000 MARKS REWARD!
Who has seen the man pictured above, Bank Director Haghi, since midday?
"Not even a mouse would be able to leave the city he has to be here somewhere... "
"There's a small error... I want to report... "
"It's just that... the numbers on the thousand pound notes... which I have to deliver a receipt for...
the telegram contains different numbers...!"
"No. 719... has switched the telegrams...!
The Clown Nemo is Haghi!"
"A little music please - Mr. Conductor -!"
"Curtain -!"
VIENNA - Anno Domini 1914
with its oldest guardian, St. Stephen's
guiding - comforting- consoling
and its so contrasting symbol, the "Iron Man"- a remnant of the Middle Ages
heartless - soulless - threatening
where Hapsburg's throne stands - Glorious and Proud.
In the shadow of the Emperor's Palace - aloof, feudal, imposing but crumbling stands the residence of the Princes von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg.
Maria Immaculata, Princess von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg.
"Your Highness, today is 'Corpus Christi'..."
"All right!"
Prince Ottokar von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg
His Majesty's Chamberlain and Lord Steward General of Cavalry - Captain of all Guards.
"...and get the hell out!"
"Well - say it!"
"Come on - say it!"
"You - ugly old fool!"
"If you could only see yourself!"
"It's pitiful!"
The "love child" of this ideal, blissful union slumbered still.
His Highness, Nicholas Ehrhart Hans Karl Maria, Prince von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg
His Majesty's Chamberlain and First Lieutenant of the Imperial and Royal Life Guard-Mounted.
"Why this unusual pleasure?"
"I thought - I might drive over with you, Papa!"
"If you think you can touch me - forget about it!"
"I'm in a terrible hole!"
"Blow out your brains!"
"...or..."
"...marry money!"
"Well - I'll see Mama about it!"
"How much does the hand kiss cost this morning?"
"No joking, Mother - I'm in a terrible hole!"
"Stop your poker and your expensive girlies..."
"...or marry money!"
"Marry money - that's all I hear!"
"I'll tell you what we'll do..."
"...select the bride, Mother - and I'll walk down the aisle with her..."
"...to the Wedding March - tomorrow!"
"But remember - she must have money..."
"...mountains of money!"
"Meanwhile, if you can let me have a little..."
Then, Corpus Christi - the greatest religious and military celebration of the year.
"Just stick around me, folks!"
"That's the truth, Frau Schrammell - my boy, Schani, always gets the best place!"
"You said it, Herr Eberle - the girl that gets him for a husband is lucky!"
"Did you get that - Mitzi?"
"Didn't you hear your mother say you're lucky?"
"Are you harping' again on the same old thing?"
"What do you think I'm hangin' 'round you fer - huh?"
"I thought we came here to see the Procession - an' not to talk!"
"Well - if Herr Schani wants to talk about it now..."
"I don't see why you shouldn't wanta!"
"Saphead!
You're goin' to lose the best chance you'll ever have!"
"You don't want our Mitzi to marry a man she doesn't love?"
"Ain't that a nice view?"
"Ain't we got no right to see nothin' a-tall?"
"That's one o' them swells that don't do nothin'..."
"... lots o' gold tassels an' plumes..."
"...and we're payin' fer it!"
"But he looks nice - don't he?"
"Just gimme his masquerade - an' watch me!"
"Don't they smell sweet?"
"I ain't smelling' nothin' - but the stink o' horses!"
"Married?"
"If it weren't for old man Schweisser's corn-plaster business..."
"...his daughter would not be such a bad match for Nicki - would she?"
"...and old Schweisser himself is so very ambitious."
"I'd thought of it myself..."
"...but - the girl limps!"
"What's a little limp - with twenty millions!"
"Is she badly hurt?"
"You are under arrest!"
Then, the Procession - the Procession that Mitzi had waited so long to see.
There is no such thing as accident.
It is Fate - mis-named.
"My father."
"Much better - Thanks!"
"I don't know how to thank you."
"Herr Oberleutnant!"
"My name is - Nicki."
"Nicki - what?"
"I'll bet you have a name - a kilometer long!"
"So let's make it - just Nicki!"
"I thought - you might like them!"
"I might like them!"
"...the best I ever had - was when father bought for me..."
"...a five-cent bag of jelly beans!"
Then, dreamy Nussdorf.
"I ain't goin' to let that skirt-chaser ruin Mitzi's chances with Schani!"
After the guests had gone.
"You owe me a kiss, Mitzi."
"You blew out the match!"
"Our beautiful 'Blue Danube'!"
"Down there - the 'Danube-Maids' come to the shore - some times..."
"...to see them means happiness - an' luck..."
"...an' love!"
"I never saw them - an' I s'pose I never will!"
"But I'm satisfied just so I don't ever see the 'Iron Man'!"
"What do they say about him?"
"They say - some nights he comes to life..."
"...an' drags away a 'Danube-Maid'!"
"An' to the ones who see him..."
"You believe that, Mitzerl?"
"It is nothing - but the people's foolish fancies!"
"That's my Fairy Coach..."
"...where I dream an' wish I'd see the 'Danube-Maids'!"
"Perhaps I'll bring you luck - and we shall see them!"
"A drive through Paradise!"
"You were made for love - Mitzerl!"
"You mustn't say the things to me..."
"...that you say to your fine ladies..."
"...because I might believe them."
"I want you to believe them!"
"An' - you'll come again?"
A few days afterward, Schani was released from prison.
"Jailbird!"
"Seen Mitzi yet?"
"The way this woman-hound's been chasin' Mitzi is somethin' awful!"
"Well - he believes in working' fast!"
"She's out in the buggy!"
"Oh - so that's the way you feel - huh?"
"...that's what I get fer goin' to jail fer you!"
"You mushin' 'round with this here sow-bone!"
"Just let me get my hands on him!"
"I'll kick his glass-eyed mug to goulash!"
Then, in that little crooked house - in that little crooked street.
"...a kiss all around - and then I leave you."
"Are you leaving before old Schweisser's party?"
"Tonight I crave apple blossoms!"
"Apple blossoms!
What do you mean?"
"I'm going to meet a real nice girl."
"At this hour of the morning?"
"It's when her parents snore the loudest!"
"I was afraid you would not come."
"I was on duty - I couldn't get away!"
"This-h is - my party!"
"...now listen... Highness... I...
"...y-you... h-have... a n-nice son!"
"...a-an'... n-no - m-money!"
"...u-understand?"
"...a-an'... I h-have... a n-nice... g-girl..."
"...a-and... l-lots - o-o'... m-money!"
"... N-Now... h-how... a-about... m-my d-daughter..."
"...a-an'... Y-YOUR -- son...?"
"I-I'll... fix... your... s-son... u-up - right."
"How much do I get?"
"Five Hunder' Thousan' Kronen!"
"HOW MUCH?"
"One million kronen!"
"...t-thass... a... gentleman's... agreement..."
"...an' you will come again?"
"...an' love me always?"
"Always!"
"The 'Iron Man'!"
"Nothing but shadows, dear - and fog!"
It was mid-morning before Schweisser dragged himself home- to face his daughter.
"I... I was with His Highness Prince von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg..."
"We have arranged for you and his son Prince Nicki..."
"...to get married!"
"But I have never even met the Prince!"
"You will - soon."
"How could he be in love with me?"
"You have twenty millions!"
"Money couldn't make a man feel love!"
"Don't be a silly little goose - love will come - in time."
"Princess Cecelia - doesn't that sound nice?"
"A limping Princess!"
"I presume you even proposed to the young lady..."
"...or did you leave that insignificant little detail to me?"
"Did it ever occur to you that I might be in love with somebody else?"
"You - in love?"
"You idiot!"
"Of course, you two wouldn't know - but some people do fall in love - really!"
"But marriage is one thing and love another!"
"I am tired of this nonsense!"
"I command!"
"The wedding is on the First of June!"
"How dare he talk to me that way!"
"But, Nicki..."
"...this would mean so much money!"
"How much?"
"A huge fortune!"
"Seems to me that girl limps - on both legs!"
"Peace be with you, my child..."
Then, Nature mourned - the birds were hushed - it rained, rained, and rained.
"Your father wants you at the Inn, Schani."
"I wanta show you somethin'..."
"...here's good news o' your Prince Charmin'!"
"Now he's gave you the kick - how about an honest offer?"
"There ain't many guys as broadminded as me!"
"Let's get hooked up proper, an' for good!"
"I love you - Mitzerl!"
"I hate you!"
"I love him!"
"And I always will!"
"I'll kill that dirty dog..."
"...when he comes out o' church today!"
"...until death doth you part!"
"Nicki..."
"I love these apple blossoms."
"So do I."
"Please don't!
I'll marry you..."
"...honest I will!"
"So... I'm good enough now?"
"All right - we'll get married!"
"Say your last 'Ta-Ta' to him!"
"Who was that sweet girl - in tears?"
"...and that awful looking man?"
"I - I never saw them before!"
"How beautiful - these apple blossoms are!"
"Won't they always remind you...?"
"Yes - always!"
Mascotte had to stand still all the year round so she was all the more lively at the ball of the Parisian painters and models
Gaby, Mascotte's friend
"It is nothing..."
"... you only mustn't dance that exuberantly."
"That little girl probably hasn't eaten her fill very often in her life."
"She is a painter's model... like I."
"A few months in Davos - that could save her perhaps."
"Wouldn't that cost an awful lot of money?"
"It's certainly going to take five or six thousand francs."
"Let's hold an auction!
Each of you donates a picture."
"First we auction off this painting..."
"...depicting..."
"...the eruption of Mount Vesuvius!"
"Madonna under Cherry Trees!"
"Nine francs and forty!"
"9 Francs 40, going once, going twice..."
"...going..."
"My husband!"
"...my husband..."
"May I get you a little refreshment?"
"Hello, Jean!"
"Have you met Mr. Gaston Duprés?
"Im happy to see that you enjoy yourself, Josette..."
"Eight hundred francs, all in all..."
"Perhaps your nude portrait will fetch a higher price."
"I bid ten times as much..."
"... but for the model in the original!"
"The original will be auctioned off!"
"I'll pose for free for fourteen days for whoever bids most!"
"Do you really want to embarass me in front of everybody?"
"Is nobody going to bid more? ..."
"4900 going once..."
"...going twice..."
"You'll travel to Switzerland and get well again..."
"... so well that you can dance whole nights through again."
"Has my wife come home?"
"No, but right now a messenger has brought this letter."
"I'm coming to Mr. Dardier as a model."
"There's a model who wants to talk to you."
"Don't you recognize me?"
"I've come to thank you in my friend's name, and..."
"It wasn't meant that way!
Today I don't need a model! You may just go home!"
"Thank you!"
"Please stay!"
Jean, after all that has happened, there's no place in your house for me anymore.
I ask you to arrange for Adrienne to bring my clothes into the hotel.
You took my harmless flirt with Gaston as a cause to take part in this scandalous auction and to snub me in front of all people.
You alone are responsible for all this.
Josette
"Let me take your coat!"
"You look enchanting!"
"Im looking forward to our fourteen days!"
"Do you know, Mr. Dardier, that your wife loves you? ..."
"... Otherwise, would she write such jealous letters to you?"
"I heard about what has happened..."
"I may be an advocate by profession, but you know:
first of all I'm your friend! ..."
"How bitter for someone like you who so rarely associates with someone new!"
"I'll leave you alone..."
... with your pain!"
"Giron is the biggest gossip of Paris."
"Now the whole city will think that you are my mistress."
"You could wish for nothing better!
..."
"Keep me here for fourteen days, and I'll get you back your wife!"
"When she's mad with jealousy she will return of her own accord!"
"It's a deal!
..."
"... And now we're going to get some clothes for you."
"You can't walk around as a pirate for two weeks!"
"I've got an awful lot to tell you."
"... nude...."
"Things shape up well, it's Madame Dardier."
"How are you, my dear Gaston?"
"You call me by my name, Josette?"
The pact was made - the intrigue began.
"My spy service works."
Today Six Day Race
Art Exhibition 11 o'clock
"You can let go now, - she doesn't see us anymore."
"She's already taking the bait!"
"To your health!"
"...
"To your health, darling!"
"You'll see, not three days will pass,- and she returns."
"That's good for you, Mr. Dardier."
"Good night, little Mascotte!"
"Good morning, little Mascotte!"
"What are the two of them doing this evening?"
"They don't go out today."
"Then you have a day off, Mascotte..."
"... or would you like to keep me company in the evening?"
"I will order a little dinner..."
Mademoiselle will pretty herself up nicely and do me the honour to be my guest.
"How beautiful it is to have dinner without having to make someone jealous!"
"But don't keep me waiting for long, I'm terribly hungry!"
"I'm just getting my jewellery.
We're... I am going to Nice tomorrow."
"... I knew you would come back to me!"
"Dinner is served."
"Lay a third place!"
"You don't expect me to sit at one table with this... person!"
"But didn't you realise that everything with Mascotte was just an act?"
"And what about Gaston Duprés?"
"I've of course put an end to that affair before I went to you."
"Now I have to pretty myself up.
After all, I have to fight dangerous competition."
"... at ten o'clock in the Café de Paris!"
"Madame will be there soon."
"Where is Mascotte?"
"She must be afraid of you..."
"Sorry, I don't want to disturb."
"Serve the ladies and gentlemen in there
"Right, now you can marry me!"
"And where is Mr. Dardier?"
"The ladies and gentlemen have all left."
"You want to leave me, Mascotte?"
"The fourteen days are over..."
"Couldn't you add one more evening--"
"Please put me through to the advocate Giron."
"Ask him if I can come to him now,... concerning my divorce."
"Di-vorce."
"Doctor Giron is expecting you!"
"Why are you getting divorced, Mr. Dardier?"
"Can't you guess, Mascotte? .."
"I called for you because now the going gets rough."
"Go back to Dardier repentantly, - I'll talk him round to forgive you."
"Mr. Dardier!"
"And if I meet that -- person there?"
"--- then you say that you've reconciled here at my place."
So you're really firmly resolved to get divorced?
Power of attorney
"I've done something stupid, - you have make good for it..."
Hurry to Dardier and take Josette with you before her husband returns."
"My dear, I owe it to you that I've finally found my way back to Jean."
"But didn't he file for divorce?"
"... and we've reconciled at the advocate's!"
"Where is Mascotte?"
My former master in such cases used to console with a trip to the south.
"Jean, it seems you don't love me anymore!"
"Gone!
Thank God, gone!"
"In a packed travel car with Gaston!"
"I'm going to Nice and get Mascotte back to me!"
"Now I've given up Gaston...
for his sake...!"
"... and you know that I cannot be alone!"
"Then go with him and get Gaston back to you!"
"I was left high and dry..."
"- you were left high and dry..."
"...
What business do the two of us have in Paris? !"
"Which is why we're going to Nice!"
"Do you have berths for Nice?"
"The lady and the gentleman are married?
"Shared compartment, then!"
"No, - separate!"
"The front axle is twisted, - I can't repair the car here."
"It's ten kilometers to the next station, perhaps you can reach a train to Nice there."
"Sleeping car!"
Do you have berths for Nice?"
"... together!"
"I'm sorry, I only have one gents' and one ladies' bed left."
"When do we arrive at the next station?"
"I'm getting off."
"But nobody needs to know about it!"
"Little Mascotte, are you already awake?"
"Who is there?"
"Who else but your little Gaston!"
"What did you do with Mascotte?"
The end.

Well, we finished earlier than Ike and I expected.
- Are you going anywhere?
So the next time, I changed to another tailor, but found out that he was no better than the first.
I bought some pretty expensive cloth and took it to him and you should've seen the mess he made of it
I told him I wouldn't pay for the thing, but the trouble is, he's got my material.
Well, I left the suit with him and it's been there ever since.
- Good evening Miss White. And how are you?
- I'm all right, thanks.
- I haven't seen you for a long time.
Have you come to take Frank for a walk.
- That's right. - Well, I must push along.
- Well dear.
- I've been waiting here half an hour for you.
- Sorry sir.
Full up. You'll have more room upstairs.
I think I told you, there's more room upstairs!
Sorry Sir.
I've lost one of my gloves.
I think I left it at the other table.
Thought so, there's a hole in two fingers.
Would you like a pair of nail scissors for Christmas?
- Funny, aren't you?
- Oh Miss, Miss!
It's no good being impatient, you'll have to wait your turn.
What's the matter with you today? Got out of bed the wrong side?
-I don't like waiting about for you.
Do you expect the entire machinary of Scotland Yard to be held up to please you?
You and your Scotland Yard
If it weren't for Edgar Wallace nobody'd ever heard of it.
Funny, aren't you?
Anyway, what's the hurry?
We're only going to the pictures, we've got all evening.
- Well, I don't think I want to go to the pictures.
- Oh, and why not?
-I've seen everything worth seeing.
- You haven't seen "Fingerprints".
I'd like to see that.
Still it's about Scotland Yard!
might be amusing.
They're bound to get all the details wrong.
I did hear they'd got a real criminal to direct it. - So as to be on the safe side.
Well, I've ordered.
- I'll go to the pictures with you, if you like.
Have you got an ashtray Miss?
I never seem to get an ashtray where I sit.
I've changed my mind again.
- About going to the pictures.
- You mean you don't want to go again?
- I don't know , I just don't want to.
- Isn't that enough?
- No, it's not enough ... oy, Miss!
- I'm going to get the bill.
I'm about fed up with you. lf you don't want to go, I do.
- Oh all right, I'll come too.
Oh, don't let's have a row.
I'm sorry. I know I've been rather beastly today.
- Miss! - Frank, I've said I'm sorry.
Here, that will cover it.
Hold on.
Then you needn't come any further.
Oh, no now I said that I'd see you home, and I will.
But I'm only just around the corner.
Do you know Whites?
The newsagent?
- Yes? In the Kings road?
Then we're neighbors.
- Have you ever seen an artist's studio?
- No, I'd love to.
- Come up and see mine.
- Oh, I can't now.
- Why not now?
- Why, it's so late.
- Are you frightened?
- No, course not.
Then why not now?
I must be getting home.
- You are frightened.
- I'm certainly not ... take more'n a man to frighten me.
Yes...that's what I thought....at first.
- What is the time?
- Not very late.
- Come on.
Oh, no harm really.
Besides, I always think a girl knows instinctively when she can trust a man.
Yes, of course she does.
May I call you Alice?
Before you go in, could I...?
That chap's nothing but a sponger.
Always pestering people up and down this street.
I'm right up there.
Excuse me a minute, will you?
I say, I'm awfully sorry.
I won't be a minute. You start walking up.
About this note, did he leave any message?
No, he wouldn't leave any message.
-Have you seen him before.
- Yes, the same gent what called here several times.
Thanks very much.
What a lovely room.
Did you do it all yourself?
Hardly.
I say, do you feel cold? I think I'll light the fire.
That's good, isn't it? - Oh that?
Yes, that's a new one, just finished.
- How do you hold this?
Oh Lord, not like that.
Let me show you.
You take this and hold it like that, you see...
Then you get the brush and hold it there.
- Oh, look what I've done.
- Draw something Alice.
Rotten.
Never mind. We'll finish this masterpiece together.
Now you hold the brush.
Steady.
There we are.
You are awful.
Already a pick ahead of me.
I'll go and get those drinks....
I say, how would I do for one of your models?
- Let's see it on you.
- Do you mean, put it on?
- Oh, it's so strong!
Oh no, I don't think so.
Besides I have to go home soon.
Pity. I would have like to have sketched you in it.
- Would you have really?
- Yes, but perhaps you are right. It wouldn't suit you.
I bet it would.
- Shall I really try it on?
- Think this will be big enough for me.
- I said, do you think this will be big enough for me.
- Go on, play something.
- Wait a minute, how does that thing go?
And that's a song about you my dear.
You haven't said how you like it.
- I can't do it up. -Wait a minute.
Where is this trouble?
- I can't do it all up.
- Never mind.
- Wait a minute, it isn't quite right.
- I better go.
- Please give it to me.
Don't be silly Alice. Don't be silly.
No, no, let me go!
- Who did you say it was?
- Mr. Who? - No! Crewe, I tell you!
Don't you worry. I'll send round straight away. What number did you say?
Seven or eleven?
- 31. - 31?
Just take a look around, will you?
Anyone'd think you hadn't been asleep all night.
What do you think! ?
They tell me the police are round there now.
'cause I don't think the police are what they were.
Morning, Alice. 'eard about the murder?
- Yes, I heard.
- Do you remember Frank's telephone number dear?
- No, but here, you'll find it in the book.
- I mean, some murders are so different to others aren't they?
Pushed his lady friends under the water when they was having a bath
What was his name? you remember?
I think that was ever so beastly.
It gave me the shivers. After I read about it, I didn't dare 'ave a bath for a month.
An' for weeks after that I only used to 'ave a rinse down.
What was his name? You remember, Smith, wasn't it?
What's wrong Alice? You don't look very cheerful this morning.
-You do look a little bit peeky, I must say.
- Dad, Alice, breakfast.
I couldn't look bak'n in the face after what happened last night and under our very noses.
Mind you, I don't think, meself, it's all together the police's fault.
What I mean is, they 'ave to wink at some things.
I mean it's one thing to buy chocolates out of hours, but it's quite another to stick a knife into a gentleman.
I must say I feel the same way about that too.
A good, clean, honest whack over the 'ead with a brick is one thing.... ...something British about that.
But knives? No. Knives is not right.
I must say that's what I think and that's what I'll keep.
Whatever the provocation, I could never use a knife.
Now, mind you a knife is a difficult thing to handle.
I mean any knife.... knife.... knife....
a butcher's knife!
I mean, in Chelsea you mustn't use a.. KNIFE!
- Dear, you ought to be more careful.
You might have cut somebody with that.
Customer.....
- No news of the murder yet?
- What's the matter Alice?
Had another row with Frank?
- Another customer Alice.
- Dear, it's Frank. Hello Frank.
- I say, have you 'eard about our murder?
- Yes, they put me on it. - Did they?
That's good isn't it? Well, I hope you get him Frank!
- If they do, that will mean promotion, won't it?
- D'you reck'n you'll get him soon?
- Well, uh, I don't know.
-Well, I came in here to phone.
Come here a minute will you?
- Well I must be going now. Good-bye, Mrs. White, good-bye, Mr. White.
Now you two.
Why don't you tell me?
Look, you know where I found that?
It's the only piece of evidence that you were there.
I'm keeping it back at present.
For God's sake, say something!
- If you're not using the phone...uh, may I?
I, uh, I want to get on to Scotland Yard.
- I want the best cigar in the shop.
Perhaps you'd like to telephone while I get it down?
- No thanks, that can wait.
Now, uh, what sort of a cigar would you like sir? I've got..
I' ve got 'enry Clay or Corona, Corona?
- Any news of the murder.
- No, nothing yet.
- Have you heard anything?
- No, no news.
- Are you, uh, quite sure?
- What the hell business is it of yours, anyway?
- You know, I looked everywhere for that other glove last night.
But, of course, you detectives are better trained at finding these things.
- Ah, here we are sir.
Oh, they look good. - They ought to.
I've had ' em for years.
- Yes, I thought the top was broken, but it's all right.
- Have you a light?
- How silly of me, hadn't noticed it.
- Uh.. all right sir?
- Oh, ha, of course, sorry.
I say... would you pay for this?
Is this gentleman a friend of yours, Frank?
Well, we're not exactly friends. At least not yet. But we're going to do a little business together, aren't we, Frank?
I'll look after the shop, Father.
You go and finish your paper.
Oh....all right my dear, all right.
Rather unfortunate that poor man died around the corner last night.
Perhaps it's rather fortunate, that your little secret only came into the hands of a man like me.
D'you know, there are some men who would make money out of a thing like that.
What a chance for blackmail.
Oh, oh that's awful.
I couldn't do a thing like that.
Morning, Miss.
Two of each there.
By the way. You're a detective. Let me give you a tip.
Don't wave important clues in telephone boxes.
They've got glass doors.
You know, uh, detectives in glass houses shouldn't wave clues.
Come on, out with it.
Couldn't we discuss that over breakfast?
Mother this is a friend of Frank's.
- Mr. Tracy, would you like something to eat?
- Lovely weather, we're having.
- Who did you say that man was?
- He's a very important friend of Frank's.
I'll get the breakfast for him.
- Here! Aren't we rude? Won't you take my chair?
- Did you see, or hear anything during the night?
- What time did you go to bed? - About half past ten, sir.
- Did you write this?
- How old would you say this man was.
- I'm afraid I couldn't tell you, sir, he had his hat on.
- Did you notice anything particular about his clothes?
- Well, uh, he had a black hat and a loose kind of collar.
'nd a tie and that's about all, I think.
- Was he dark or fair?
- Well, you couldn't say he was a blond and you couldn't say he was a brunette.
He was a bit of both, you know, kind of mousey.
- Except when he spoke to you, he went like this.
Give me records.
- Well, bring him along. Let's hear what he's got to say.
-Yes, sir.
- That'll do to go on with.
- How much longer is that man going to stay? Don't tell me he'll be here to dinner.
- Don't make things awkward mother. It means a lot to to me and Frank.
- Well, I don't see why they should carry on their business in my parlour.
- I'll take it. - Very well.
- But I don't like that man and the sooner he goes the better.
You are very clever. I can see that all right.
Just a minute will you?
A pal of yours at the Yard, said he thought you might be here.
Well, I thought you wouldn't mind if...
- Any news Frank?
- Alice, lock that door.
As you were saying ... rather unfortunate the way that poor man round the corner, uh, died last night.
On the other hand, perhaps it's fortunate.
For us, that is... that a suspicious looking man, with a criminal record, was seen hanging around the place.
Look here, don't you try and swing this thing on me.
That won't get you anywhere.
- Also rather unfortunate, that Scotland Yard, are at present looking for that man.
- Just a minute Alice.
- But there's one thing you seem to have forgotten....
- Before we get to any hanging, I shall have quite a lot to say. And the first thing I shall say is, that she was there too.
Isn't there one thing you seem to have forgotten, that our word's as good as, or perhaps a bit better than that of a jailbird.
So we'll face that when the time comes.
Meanwhile, we'll just sit quietly here until the squad van arrives.
- That surprises you doesn't it?
- No, it doesn't surprise me in the least.
When it comes, the surprise won't be for me.
- Very well then, we are both satisfied. - Yes, we're both satisfied.
It's my word, against hers.
- Frank, you can't do this. - Why not?
- Now, now, don't interfere, Alice, I know what I'm doing.
You don't, you don't.
- Why can't you let her speak.
- You mind your own business. In any case, she'll speak at the right moment.
Why can't we, both of us, chuck the whole thing now? I've got nothing against you.
You've got nothing against me.
Except, of course, I had some cash from you, but I wasn't serious.
Well, look here, have it back now.
Well can't you see, that she wants to chuck it up too?
And so do I, you know.
You tell him. Tell him that he's playing with fire and...
And we shall, all of us, burn our fingers.
I'm not bad really, I only... things have gone wrong lately, and one's got to live, you know.
All right then. It's still my word against hers.
You men meet me in the back, Frank, follow me!
I say, it's not me you want..... It's him.....ask him.
Why his own....
Not very often I see you so early in the day as this.
- Called to see Frank?
No, I want to see lnspector Walls, please.
-Then you'll have to fill out one of these forms, you know.
- Do you know something about this?
George, just a minute.
Take this along to inspector Walls.
Well I suppose you're going to tell him who did it, Miss.
- You can come along now
- Come in, please.
You've something to tell us about this case. - Yes.
- Well, what is it?
Is this worthwhile sir, now that everything has been cleared up?
Let's hear what she's got to say.
What I was going to say is this...
I'd better say, what I have to say now...
I would rather not wait.
What I wanted to say is... - I was the one.
Yes, hold on. Will you deal with this young lady,
I shall be busy for a minute.
This way Miss, please.
Alice, whatever made you come here?
He tried oh, I can't tell you.
It's too terrible.
I was defending myself.
I didn't know what I was doing and then...
- Ha, ha! So you found him, Miss. Did she tell you who did it.
You'll want to look out, or you'll be losing your job my boy.
I suppose we'll soon have lady detectives up in the Yard, eh.
And I shall be all right on the dole, won't I.
There it is, Herb.
One verse and two choruses.
- Is this a good song, Eddie?
- It's a good song, Herb.
- It's as good as the doll-dance number.
Skip the verse, do the chorus, tempo.
Hot, eh?
I've got the hottest song you ever heard in your life.
Have you got it?
Jimmy, if you can get this crowd to keep quiet, I'll sing it for you.
- How about a little harmony?
Listen, let's go through it.
The second chorus, a little jazz, a little pep.
Come on, I'll vamp until ready.
Go on, Herb.
- The chorus in F-sharp.
Listen, kid, if we can get that number, we're a cinch for the Palace.
Listen, Eddie, we'll take that song and smack it over for you.
Oh, no. Not this song, babies.
Zanfield's bought it for his new revue.
And the Mahoney Sisters are coming from the West to put it over for me.
Listen, Eddie, you're not gonna waste a swell number like that on a smalltime sister act, are you?
Nix cracking, Rosie.
Half of that sister team is going to be the future Mrs. Eddie Kearns.
If you wanna be made overnight, just give us a crack at that number.
Positively not.
I've gotta get back to the hotel.
The girls are waiting for me.
Oh, but listen, if you want a song see Georgie Cohan.
He writes good music too.
How about it, Jimmy?
Oh, I'll take that, thank you.
Gee, this is elegant, ain't it?
Tell you better when I get a peek at the beds.
I told you to pack that cooking outfit in the trunk.
Well, I'm taking no chances.
If we can't pay our bill and the hotel holds the trunks, we still eat.
And, baby, when you don't eat, you lose a lot of calories.
Calories?
Oh, acrobats, you big sap.
- Well, I never got fat on your cooking.
You never got that complexion from the Greeks.
- Don't talk to me like...
- Ixnay, ixnay.
- Leave us plenty of towels too.
And I counted them.
How high can you count?
Well, everything's okay.
Will there be anything else?
Yeah, food.
I think he may stall for a tip.
Get to the window and give me the high sign.
Hank, I don't wanna do that.
Don't be such a cheapskate.
Screw.
Say, did they run out of everything but dollar signs on this thing?
One coffee, one order of fried eggs.
There's two in an order, ain't they?
- And one order of rolls.
Come look at the elegant view.
Oh, that will be all, thank you.
Cup of coffee, order of rolls, a couple of eggs.
Oh, Queenie, New York.
The place we've dreamed and talked about.
- Ain't it swell?
But there's something about it that scares me, Hank.
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Well, it seems like we're taking an awful chance.
We were getting along so well out west.
Plenty of work, small jumps, a chance to save money.
And the act always went over big.
But here, nobody knows us.
Oh, I'm afraid.
Now don't lose your nerve, honey.
But we haven't got much money.
Oh, Hank, couldn't we go back, just for one more year?
Back to those opera houses and town halls?
Those cheap hotels and their lobby comics?
Cooking our own food washing our own clothes and ironing them on mirrors.
Riding in those smelly day-coaches.
Going ragged all summer and then darn near freezing in the winter.
Just to save money enough to get to New York and show our act.
With your looks and my ability...
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
Now don't worry.
You see that electric sign of the fellow in BVDs?
- Well, right there they're gonna have the Mahoney Sisters.
- In BVDs?
- Yes, in BVD...
Baby, they were plenty smart when they made you beautiful.
Come on, let's get cleaned up before Eddie gets here.
I'll run a tub for you.
The Mahoney Sisters in BVDs.
Hey, what are you singing?
The bubble song from Lux.
Will you join me?
No use of us both getting wet.
Will you wash mine?
I might as well.
You never wash anything but your neck.
I not only wash them. I gotta pick them up.
Oh, Hank, I didn't think.
Oh, you never do.
Oh, don't strain yourself. I'll get them.
Oh, boy, this is going to be good.
Can you imagine my embarrassment?
Uncle Jed!
Hello, honey.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you, Hank.
- Oh, Queenie, hurry up.
It's Uncle Jed!
Uncle Jed?
What a break for you.
- I'll be with you in just a minute.
- All right, honey, but hurry.
What do you know, Uncle Jed?
I've got you booked for 30 weeks over at the Manley Time.
We're in New York to stay.
Say, listen, girls you know, I know this town better than you do.
And there are more sisters doing their acts over the lunch counters in New York than over the...
Than in the theaters.
You're just a crapehanger.
Maybe, but let me tell you tell you, tell you, tell you...
What's the name of that record you're playing?
Say, listen, girls...
Well, what is it?
I love both you girls, and I want to see you get along.
Sure, Uncle Jed, we know that.
But we aren't leaving this town till we get a flash at Babe Ruth and Grant's Tomb.
- Oh, will you get that, Uncle Jed?
Oh, girls, your break... Your break...
Your coffee's here.
Bring the toothbrush glass when you come.
- Will you have some coffee, Uncle Jed?
I just had my breakf...
- Uncle Jed!
Gosh, what a big girl you are.
- And so beautiful.
- Ain't she, though?
Well, I suppose you've decided to stay in New York.
Yeah, we're all set.
But thanks for the offer, Uncle Jed.
I'll keep it open for a few days.
- Oh, goodbye, Uncle Jed.
- If you wanna see me, just call me up.
You're in the phone book?
I think we're making an awful mistake not to take that work.
We stand as big a chance as anybody else.
What did the Duncans have when they hit Times Square?
"My Patio."
Say, we've got more than the Duncans ever had.
Well, the Duncans are pretty good too.
Say, what'd we do to them on the Gus Sun Time?
We knocked them off their seats.
Let me have a good look at you.
- Gee, but it's good to see you.
- Oh, boy, is it good to see you! Oh, gee!
That's my Queenie!
You don't mean to tell me it's...
Queenie, all grown up and everything.
Ain't she?
That sisterly kiss won't be so hard to take now.
I'll say it won't.
- Take it big.
You were a funny-looking thing the first time I saw you with those gangly legs and freckles.
But you certainly turned out to be a beautiful girl.
Well, I'll go get some clothes on.
I'm just crazy about her, Eddie.
She's so young and beautiful.
Of course she is.
Well, Hank, now that you're here, when are we going to get married?
Oh, not till we've put this act over.
I'm gonna give Queenie a break.
Always doing something for somebody else.
No wonder I love you.
- I kind of got a weakness for you too.
Mrs. Eddie Kearns?
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Swell, Eddie.
Yeah, and you can feature that anytime in the electric lights.
- Gee, still the same sweet kid, ain't you?
- Why, certainly.
Hank, did you pack my new dress in the trunk?
I'll get it for you in a minute.
Come here, Queenie.
- Gee, I can't get over how she's changed.
- Well, you sure look elegant, Eddie.
- Doesn't he, Hank?
- He's an eyeful.
Three carats.
And here's the payoff.
Look, but don't laugh.
Gold garters!
Oh, Eddie, I always knew you'd make good.
Yeah, and I ain't forgetting that you're the little girl that made me come to New York.
Remember when I wanted to quit and give the whole thing up and you made me stick it out?
Well, now I'm gonna do something for you.
Zanfield's bought my new song, "The Broadway Melody."
And he's naming his revue after it.
- But I've already spoken to him about you.
- You think we've got a chance?
Don't be silly.
One word from me, and you're in.
- Queenie, ain't that great?
- Sure, if it's true.
True? You don't know how I stand with Zanfield.
- If we're in, what do we do?
And how much do we get?
You're gonna sing my "Broadway Melody" with me.
The Mahoney Sisters and Eddie Kearns.
Yeah, Eddie Kearns and the Mahoney Sisters.
Well, how does it go?
How's it go?
Now, listen, I sing a verse, and you come in on the chorus.
Then we do another chorus, and then go into a little dance.
- Give us an idea of the dance.
- I'll give you an idea.
- Swell, Eddie, do it again.
Let's move back this table, kids. We'll do our dance.
All ready, girls?
Come on, now, let's go.
Queenie, why don't you look at my feet?
Attagirl!
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!
- What's the matter with the left leg?
Go on, sit down, take a load off your mind.
- Don't talk to me like that. I don't feel well.
- Listen, don't answer me back, understand?
There's Eddie.
Hello, hey!
Your rhythm is all wrong.
Nothing like I showed you.
All right, now watch.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, how are you?
We had a tough time getting in!
When do we show the act?
I haven't had a chance to talk to Zanfield yet.
- It's okay, ain't it?
- We're in?
Sure, it's in the bank.
- Whatever I say goes.
- Hey, Kearns!
We don't wanna take all afternoon to set one dance.
Maybe we'd better get undressed.
All right, Sam, let it go.
- Wait a minute, hold it there.
Hold it, Sam.
The sets are all ready for your okay, Mr. Zanfield.
That's just an idea of what it's gonna be.
It's just an idea.
But don't worry, I'll fix it.
- Okay on those sets.
Remind me to see that rehearsal in the morning.
I'm having lunch at the Knickerbocker.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, this material, I couldn't get it in the gold design, only in the silver.
- Isn't it lovely?
Get it in the gold.
- Remember, I want that in the gold.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, pardon me, will you take a look at the Mahoney Sisters right now?
- The Maloney Sisters?
- No, the Mahoney Sisters.
- Who are they? I never heard of them.
- It's the sister act I told you about.
- Right over there, across stage.
All right, wheel them in.
- Tell George I'll take a look at the act.
- Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
Well, kids, you all set?
Got your music?
Well, go over there and tell him what you want.
The Baloney Sisters.
Give us the introduction pickup and some choruses.
And swell to the finish.
- But you follow us.
Sam, looks like some carnival lost a good act.
I'm gonna lay that dame like a roll of linoleum.
- Hank, you can't pull that around here.
- Hank, don't start anything now.
- Get her in the dressing room.
- All set now?
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Don't mind if I put this down?
- No, ma'am.
I'll vamp till ready, and don't forget: We do things intimately.
- All set.
- All set, fine. Babies, smack it over big.
You ain't got nothing to worry about.
You're as good as in now.
- I'll go and see how the boss likes it.
Well, all right, shoot.
- Play it, will you?
- Something wrong with the piano.
- Do I have to come over and play it for you?
There's something wrong with the piano.
- Say, are you trying to crab our act?
- Well, will you play it then, hot or cold?
- Well, go ahead then.
All right, girls.
Mr. Zanfield's seen enough.
He'll let you know.
Come in next Friday.
- But he ain't seen the finish yet.
I know, all right. Line up, girls.
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, please give them a break.
You haven't seen their act.
I can use the blond, but that little cluck is out.
But don't you know it's tough to put comedy over on a bare stage?
They'll be all right at the performance.
Give them another chance.
Gee, kid, that's a tough break.
Even if the act is a louse, he should've seen the finish.
It ain't a louse.
It's a good act.
We stopped the show every performance we did for Jake Wells.
Yeah, the one I saw would stop a tank.
Say, you've been asking for trouble, and now you're gonna get it.
You great big peroxide-headed dizzy blond, you!
What do you think of this act?
Hey, come here!
Come here, girls!
Let me at her, will you?
Next time I'll give you a facial instead of a scalp treatment.
- Yeah, and I'll fix you, you little peanut.
- Oh, boy, I'll sock her...
- Stop it, Hank, you're crabbing everything.
Go get your clothes on.
The big blond baboon! Why'd she pick on me?
I didn't start any fight with her.
- Where's my music? - Here's your music.
- Well, where's my bag?
- Now, be quiet.
Be quiet, Hank!
Get in there.
Straighten it out.
Let's get smart, Sam.
Don't let them throw you up in the air.
I'm not gonna waste all day at it.
Give me a pickup and two choruses.
And let me tell you dames something:
If I get ahold of her, I'll rip her wide open.
Flo, what was the trouble about?
- I was beside the piano, not doing a thing...
- I can't stand for quarreling.
- I didn't start it.
Never mind who started it.
Now run along and be a good little girl.
- And remember, no more quarreling.
- Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
I heard what you said about me.
Please, couldn't you use the both of us at the same salary?
I think I can slip her in somewhere.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Zanfield!
My sister is the business manager of the act.
You won't let on that it ain't the both of us you want, will you?
- You send her over, and I'll talk to her.
He can take his old show and put it where it'll do him the most good!
Don't act like that, Hank.
He didn't see your act, that's all.
- He's a very busy man.
- Oh, he's busy?
Well, so am I busy, with 30 weeks waiting for me.
- Now, don't get so excited over nothing.
- Hank, quick!
Mr. Zanfield wants to see you.
- On the level?
- Maybe we're in after all.
I can always take care of these things better with nobody around.
All right, girls, we'll take this right from the beginning.
Okay, Sam, let it go.
I heard what you said to Zanny.
- You won't let on to Hank, will you, Eddie?
Gee, that was wonderful of you, Queenie.
I could kiss you for that.
You mustn't do that, Eddie.
I guess I shouldn't.
I never realized you were...
Gee, you're the sweetest little girl I ever knew.
You mean next to Hank.
You know, Hank's been everything in the world to me.
She's looked after me and worked for me, and fought for me, protected me.
I could never repay her for all her love and care.
Of course you love her, Queenie.
And you're gonna be everything that she wants you to be.
And I don't blame her for loving you.
Gee, but you're a cute kid.
And she loves you, Eddie.
I guess you and me are about all she ever thinks of.
Oh, I never wanna hurt her, Eddie.
And I want her to be happy with you.
Why, Queenie, I'd rather lose my pipes so I couldn't sing and go lame so I couldn't dance than to hurt Hank.
- Sure you would. So would I.
- We're in!
Rehearsal in the morning!
- I knew you'd put it over, Hank!
- Oh, just leave it to me!
I ain't booked acts for 10 years and not know how to handle them!
- You bet you haven't!
- You're both swell kids!
- And plenty smart!
- And how!
- Gee, rehearsal in the morning!
Ain't it great?
I got a lot of washing and ironing to do.
- I want you to look your best, honey.
But tell me, how did you put it over?
I said to him, "Now, you listen here, Mr. Zanfield, this is a sister team.
And we splits up for nobody!"
And with that, he smiled as nice as you please and said, "That's all right, Miss Maloney."
Can you imagine calling me Maloney?
And everybody knows our name's Mahoney.
- Yeah, can you imagine that?
- Imagine that.
"Maloney"!
Hey, come on and get those clothes on, will you?
- Well, are we all set?
Yes, sir, everything ready to go when you say the word.
- Are you safe up there, Audrey?
Yes, that's perfectly safe.
- You get the orchestra in the pit.
- Oh, Hagerty.
- That looks very good.
- I think it'll be very effective.
- So do I.
- Yes, sir.
Can you imagine?
Putting on all this makeup for just one show a day?
I'm just shaky all over.
Queenie, will you stop?
You're getting me nervous now.
It ain't a bit different than it was in Reading, PA.
And we're going over just as big.
- Oh, Hank, do you think so?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
- Are you decent, girls?
- Yeah, come in.
Oh, Hank, get a load of this.
"Big mammoth appearance of the Mahoney Sisters on Broadway.
Zanfield saw them once, and they were in.
With appreciation and regards to our agent, Uncle Jed."
- Is that a pippin or not?
- You care for that?
- Do I?
- Hank, will you get Eddie out of here?
Eddie, you gotta run along now.
We're nervous.
Now, Queenie, don't be nervous.
- Remember, this is your big opportunity.
- Will you get out of here?
- Beat it, Eddie, will you?
- Now, don't forget, a lot depends on this.
- Oh, get out!
- Be careful of my hats!
- We gotta get down on the stage!
I won't allow you to ruin them.
I told you they were too high and too wide.
Well, big woman, I design the costumes for the show not the doors for the theater.
If you had, they'd have been done in lavender.
Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield, but the orchestra's killing my "Broadway Melody" number.
- Too much brass.
They can't hear me.
- Kearns, tell them to keep it down.
Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.
- All right, boys, I think we can go.
When you get through with that noise, try and play my number.
Cut out the brass, and keep it very piano.
Are you back again?
Yes, and I'm telling you how I want my music played.
I've conducted opera.
What do you know about music?
I only wrote it, that's all.
- Then you have the best of me.
You don't have to listen.
I'll tell Zanny what a sap he was for buying it.
Maybe he'll get you to write the music for the show.
If I couldn't do better than this...
If you could, you wouldn't be waving a stick!
Electrician!
A little more this way with that spotlight.
What are you trying to do, ruin my profile?
Your profile was ruined the day you were born.
That's a smart crack.
Hit me with it and keep it here.
Hey, put that spotlight over here on this girl!
- He wants it over there.
- But it goes over here.
That spotlight goes here.
I can't sing without a spotlight.
Say, you couldn't sing if you had a searchlight.
- Did you get everything you wanted?
- Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield.
Would you okay this bill for Miss William's second act?
Two grand for a coat worn for less than three minutes?
I won't pay it!
But you said ermine.
You'll giggle yourself right out of here one day.
- It's a gorgeous garment, isn't it?
- Isn't it gorgeous?
In fact, it's the gorgeous-est thing I have ever seen.
You sweet little cutie!
- Thank you, Mr. Zanfield.
- Come here, Unconscious.
- Hello, boys.
Say, Joe LeBlanc saw the rehearsal, and he says there's a fortune in the show.
- We ought to know.
We put it in.
- You think it's a good show then, Zanny?
- It's just an oil well.
- Let's see your gusher.
- Looks like a mine to me.
From all the gold-diggers you got in the troupe.
Any old time one of them can pry a nugget off of his ledge, they're going some!
Come on, Unconscious, put the load down.
Overture, girls.
This is the "Broadway Melody" number.
Get out of here and hurry up.
Get out of here.
Go on, get out.
Oh, there's the overture.
Oh, where's my hat?
Oh, where's my hat? !
- Over there!
- Over where?
- On the floor, under the clothes.
- Oh, yes. The clothes carton.
Why didn't you say so in the first place? And make it snappy.
Now, honey, remember: The dress rehearsal is tougher than a first-night performance.
So don't be nervous.
No, it's over that shoulder.
That's the idea.
With those beads.
In this...
Elgin, call a doctor.
Elgin!
That number's too slow.
Cut out the Maloney Sisters.
- Cut out the whole first chorus?
Why, has he cut us out altogether?
Ain't it awful, the way they cut out these big stars?
I'll get to you in a minute.
Listen here, Mr. Zanfield, you can't cut us out like that.
We've got equity contract.
Kearns, go into the dance on the first chorus and end it there.
One more cut for you, dearie, and you'll be holding a spear.
And one more crack from you, bimbo, and you'll be holding a lily.
Listen to me, Mr. Zanfield, we...
Will you cut it out and give me a chance to do my number?
But he cut us out of the whole show.
Did you hear that, Mr. Zanfield?
They're trying to drown me out.
- Are you trying to drown him out?
Mr. Zanfield, would you come backstage a moment?
What's the trouble now?
The other dame flopped.
How about this one?
- What are we gonna do about her?
I'm gonna give that guy an earful.
Where's that blond McGinty sister?
Use her.
Mahoney's the name, and let me tell you something...
Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
I'll get her up there.
You may not know it, but we've played some of the very best...
Listen, we want you on the prow of that boat.
Let's get your clothes off.
But I don't want to take my clothes off.
No, that'll be all right.
But listen to me. I've never taken my clothes off in my life.
I know all about that.
- How've you got this thing hooked?
Say, do I get that spot, or don't I?
That's tough.
- How's everything going, Zanny?
- Very smoothly.
Very, very smoothly.
I like that number.
That's a very good arrangement.
Where do you pick them?
I guess it's just a gift.
By the way, what's the name of that little beauty on the boat?
It'll give you something to do.
- Come on, Unconscious.
- You were great, Mahoney.
- I'll say you were.
- You'll be in a Rolls-Royce by Thursday.
What a flock of Johns will be waiting at that stage door!
- Go on. You can't kid me.
- I'm not kidding you.
I may be there myself.
- Oh, Queenie.
- Go in and change.
Hank, did you see Queenie?
What's the matter, Hank?
Wasn't Queenie great?
Aren't you proud of her?
Of course, Eddie.
I'm glad to see her make good.
Oh, but gee, we ain't never had to get by on our legs before.
Oh, that don't mean nothing, Hank.
Those guys are not gonna pay 10 bucks to look at your face.
This is Broadway.
Yeah. Broad's way.
Now, run along and change.
I'll get Queenie.
Queenie, everybody is raving about you.
- Gee, but you're a beautiful kid.
- I'm glad you like me, Eddie.
Like you?
Oh, boy. When I got a peek at you up there on that boat...
- Isn't this the beautiful lady of the boat?
- Kearns.
- I'm Jock Warriner.
- And this is Stew and Bay.
I bet them that the most beautiful girl in New York will have supper with us.
- You've got to help me win that bet.
- What have I got to do with that?
- Well, you see, you're the girl.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- I guess we win that bet, Jock.
- Hey, Unconscious, where you going?
- I'm gonna get on that boat.
Come here, sap.
You can't get on that.
That's not a real boat.
Please. Please, won't you change your mind?
- I'm sorry, but really, I can't.
- Oh, come on. Please do.
Slip us the 50.
I haven't lost yet.
Oh, yeah...?
Come here, Unconscious, come here.
You can't go up there, you'll get kicked out.
It's a ladies' dressing room.
- Let's go on the boat.
- On the boat.
Don't worry, Hank.
They only cut one number.
We got a couple of others.
"Zanny saw them once, and they were in."
Zanny saw me once, and I was out.
Not altogether.
And what of it?
Do you think that's all I'll get to do, go on without any clothes on?
Not if I can help it.
But you don't need to worry.
You got a lot more on when you ain't got anything than most of the dames I've seen around here.
Well, I guess I'll go get undressed again.
- Hello, kids.
Are you all ready?
- Yep. All ready.
Well, listen. Zanny is giving a big party at his apartment tonight.
- Let's go over.
- Gee, that's great.
Did he invite us?
Not exactly, but what's the difference? Ain't I the star of this troupe?
That guy threw me out of your song tonight.
I ain't gonna give him a chance to throw me out of a window.
Let's get a bowl of chop suey, and we'll rewrite the show.
If it'll write me back in the show, I'd go for a bowl of anything.
Well, you can get most anything out of a bowl of chop suey.
Oh, cutie!
I've got some things to do, and I'll join you later.
Well, I've... I've got an awful headache.
We'll go straight home if you'd rather.
Oh, no, Hank.
You two run along.
You'll have a lot of fun, anyway.
Come on, Queenie.
We don't wanna go without you.
Get your hat.
You'll feel better when you get out of here.
Oh, sure, honey, come on.
- You got a date with somebody, huh?
- Who, Queenie?
- Crazy, am I?
You've got a date with that Jock Warriner, I'll bet.
- Well, and what if I have?
Oh, you can't go out with that bird.
I'll have to show you whether I can or not.
Well, here I am again.
You can't get rid of me.
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Warriner.
Maybe you had better wait for me just a few minutes down on the stage.
- Shall I wait at the stage door?
- Now, don't be long.
Now, Queenie, don't act this way.
He ain't the right kind of a guy for you to go out with.
What difference does it make what kind of a guy he is?
I'm going out with him because I...
Well, because I want to.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.
You're gonna listen to me.
I can take care of myself.
And you can both mind your own business.
Why don't you mind your sister?
She knows best.
I've got my own life to live, and I'm gonna live it.
I'm not gonna be the third wheel to anybody's bicycle!
Oh, Queenie!
Oh, Eddie, what'll we do?
Why, she's never gone against my advice before.
Don't worry, Hank.
She's only a kid. She'll snap out of it.
I guess the bright lights got under her skin.
Come on, let's go and get a bowl of chili.
- Oh, you didn't go. You didn't go!
- I couldn't, Hank.
Oh, dear! I'm so glad.
Oh, they're elegant.
- Yeah. Where do I park them? - Wait a minute.
Put them over there.
Good morning, beautiful lady.
Oh, you frightened me.
- Oh, they're elegant.
- Just a little birthday card.
Yes, well, they're lovely.
You'll excuse me now?
You have some place to go, haven't you?
Are you putting me out?
Don't you like the flowers?
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- They're not half so beautiful as you.
Any girl that can look beautiful so early in the morning...
That sounds like you know a lot about girls.
- Much obliged for the compliment.
- Must I go?
- And thank you for being so nice to me.
- Not half so nice as I'd like to be.
I'm arranging a little party tonight for your birthday.
- A party for me?
But you mustn't do that.
- Because I don't want you to.
Everything's arranged.
- Hello, Queenie.
Then I'm gonna wait right here till she gets back.
Well, it looks as if I'd better take the air.
I'll give you a ring a little later, shall I?
And thank you again for the flowers.
Well, I've got my suspicions about any guy that kisses a girl's hand.
- He'll give you a ring later.
He'll give you a ring. On the telephone, but not here.
What are you burned up about?
- He hasn't done anything to you.
- And what's more, he ain't going to.
- Sit down and cool off.
Hank'll be here in a minute, and you can start raving to her.
Oh, Eddie, don't be such a crab.
Why do you let a guy like that hang around you?
Say, will you lay off him?
I'm sick of hearing you crab all the time.
- I'll give him a sock in the nose.
- You and how many others?
I don't need any others.
I can do it all by myself.
I know. But you haven't anything to do in the show.
I can team you up with this blond and still book you as the Mahoney Sisters.
Nope. I've gotta stick around and keep an eye on Queenie.
What has she been doing?
She's changed, Uncle Jed.
She don't tell me things anymore.
Night after night, she's out with Jock Warriner.
If it wasn't for Queenie, I'd be the happiest girl in the world.
With Eddie?
Now, now listen, Hank.
Why don't you give Eddie a break and marry him?
- Maybe I will.
Maybe that's just what Queenie needs:
- To see you and Eddie happy.
It's exactly what I've been trying to... Sure!
- You see, it's very simple.
- Rolling his own.
Now, watch this one.
Boy, if you could do that with my wife.
Say, give us something good, something new.
Say, can you pull a rabbit from that?
- I brought the radio with me.
- Joe, what have you got there?
- Gee, I can get Chicago with that.
Why, that's nothing.
- I got Scotland last night.
- How do you know you got Scotland?
Why, I heard the guy singing "The Best Things in Life Are Free."
Take this cake in the other room, and when you hear us yell "surprise" bring it back lighted.
Hey, give me a few of those things. Give me a few of them.
- Well, where's Queenie?
- Yeah, where's Queenie?
Why, there was another party, and I forgot to tell her about this one.
I thought she'd have more fun there.
Jock Warriner, huh.
Say, listen, I've got an idea.
Let's give the party...
- For Hank.
Wait a minute, folks. Just a second.
Take all the things down to my room. We'll hold our party there.
Hank doesn't feel very well.
Well, all right, we'll go down to your room.
I hope you feel better.
Look, Hank, I'm awfully sorry.
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- I left a present for you.
- I hope you're feeling better, Hank.
You see what you're missing?
Why don't you have a little drink?
It might buck you up.
- Good night, Hankie.
- Good night, Uncle Jed.
Good night, dear.
Ain't you coming down?
You run along, Jed. I've got to tell Hank something.
- I'll see you in a little while.
But don't make it too long.
You know that bottle won't last very long.
Queenie and me have always been on the level.
And now I'm fronting for her.
Won't you please give her all the best of the breaks?
What's the matter, Hank?
At least I've still got you.
That's one break.
Queenie, aren't you having a good time?
I'm having a marvelous time, Mr. Warriner.
Now don't call me Mr. Warriner.
Call me Jock, won't you?
Mr. Warriner.
- Wait a minute, everybody.
I want you to stand up here where everyone can see you.
- A toast!
- A toast to Queenie!
A happy birthday to Queenie, the queen of New York's beautiful girls.
- Many happy returns!
I can't say anything but thanks, everybody.
Oh, it's a lovely surprise...
Jock.
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Will you dance now?
That cake is just elegant but I can't eat it all.
Well, you eat as much as you can, and we'll save the rest.
Please, Mr. Warriner, ask them to play something else.
- I hate sentimental music.
"Broadway Melody."
Don't wear a frown on old Broadway.
Tell me why don't you like that song?
Well, what do you like?
I like cake.
Won't you tell me that you like me a little?
Will you tell me why you're so nice to me?
Please, I wanna dance.
Let's sit this one out.
But look, everybody's dancing, and the music is playing and everything.
You don't mean this for me?
Why, of course.
Diamonds should only be worn by beautiful girls.
Oh, it's just adorable.
I'd like to do a lot of things for you, Queenie.
How would you like an apartment all your own?
Say, on Park Avenue.
And a car all your own.
Perhaps a Rolls-Royce. Oh, and a lot of nice things.
Well, I'd have to think about that.
Say, where have you been?
I've been looking all over the place for you.
You would come in at a time like this.
Certainly. Come on, little love boat.
Let's have this dance.
- Were you asleep, Hank?
Well, that's swell, because I wanna to tell you about the grandest party that ever happened to me.
Look at that. Did you ever see anything more beautiful in all your life?
No, sirree. Because that's class, that is.
And Eddie said he wouldn't even give me a ring.
What would I want with his ring?
There's more diamonds in a bracelet, ain't they? Ain't they?
Honey, I don't know what you're saying this for but I know you don't mean it. You can't mean it.
- It ain't in you to mean it.
- Sure I mean it.
Why shouldn't I mean it?
And that ain't all I'm gonna have, either.
I'm gonna have a Rolls-Royce.
And an apartment on Park Avenue.
And everything that goes with it.
That's what I'm gonna have.
Now, honey, listen to me.
I know we ain't had the greatest break in the world since we hit New York.
That's got to.
And you're gonna meet somebody that's right. Somebody you can be proud of, who'll just be crazy about you.
Somebody who's really worthy of you.
Somebody like Eddie.
Yeah?
- No, sir.
No more of these kind of dumps for mine.
I'm gonna have everything in the world I want.
And you're gonna have Eddie.
Queenie, I don't want you to answer me like that again.
- Then keep your nose out of my business.
- Well, your business is my business.
That package is from Warriner, ain't it?
- I won't let you keep it, that's all.
How are you gonna stop me?
Oh, Queenie, don't you see what I'm doing is for your own good?
And don't you see what I'm doing is for your...
Oh, what are you talking about? Now you listen to me.
You're not gonna go out with that guy, hear me?
I'll stop you if I have to tie you up to do it. You hear me?
They can hear you out front.
Well, you hear me. I'm going out with whoever I want and I won't hear orders from anyone about it.
- Now get that and get it straight.
You ain't my boss.
So mind your own business and shut up.
Oh, Queenie.
And you're gonna listen to me.
I won't listen to you any more than I will to her.
So you needn't get started.
- Getting near you, Kearns.
Hank, you run along.
Now, listen, Queenie.
You're young yet, and you don't know things.
What Hank has been saying to you is for your own good.
Yeah, and I suppose what you're saying is for my own good too.
As far as that goes, yes, it is.
Whether you believe me or not, I'm saying this because I...
- Hank finished that. Got nowhere with it.
- Well, I'm gonna get somewhere.
And whether you like me or hate me, you're gonna pay attention to me because I'm...
Me and Hank won't let you go out with that guy. He's no good.
- He wants girls who...
- You never went out with girls like he does.
- Plenty, but none since I met you.
You and Hank...
Get me right, sweetie.
I'm being on the level with you.
Here's your pants, sir.
- Hurry up, Kearns.
Oh, can't I say nothing that will make you see what I mean?
You're wasting time talking against Mr. Warriner, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Warriner. Do you know what they say about that guy?
I don't care what they say.
They're jealous, that's all.
- You and the rest.
- Me, jealous?
What are you so interested for?
What business is it of yours where I go and who I go with?
It's my business because...
Well, because it is.
Oh, you ought to know why I'm doing this.
- It's because I...
- No, no, Eddie.
Oh, I gotta say it, Queenie.
I can't stop from saying it now.
And you gotta hear it.
I love you, Queenie.
I love you, and you know it.
But it's easy to say now.
I love you, dear.
And I love you, Eddie. Never forget it.
- Do you, Queenie?
Yes, Eddie.
And that's why we can't...
Oh, don't you see now why...
- I'm going out with Jock Warriner...
Don't try to stop me, Eddie.
It's the best way.
Here's your coat, sir.
- If you go out with that guy, I'll...
- There's a stage wait, Kearns.
Let it wait.
Queenie, I gotta go on now.
- Promise me you won't go out with him.
- Are you trying to ruin the show?
- Promise me, Queenie.
- Oh, I can't promise.
- Then you won't?
- Well, then I won't.
I'll murder that guy.
I'll tear him apart. Go on out with him. Go ahead.
Get on there, Kearns.
Queenie, you better be here when I get off.
- Get up to your dressing room.
Oh, Queenie. You ain't got no idea what you're doing.
Oh, yes, I have.
Can't I have a little fun without you trying to stop me?
Oh, I ain't trying to stop you having fun but this thing will turn out bad.
That guy don't mean to marry you.
His kind don't never marry.
He ain't the type to take a girl out and buy her drinks and let it go at that.
You know that. And you know what the finish will be.
Now listen to me, Hank.
Get this straight, once and for all. I'm old enough to know what I'm gonna do.
And I don't want no more cracks from you and Mr. Wise-Guy Kearns about it either.
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.
What I'm saying's for your own good.
- Tell it to somebody you don't know.
- I ain't gonna let you get away with it.
- Give me that.
- It's not yours...
- Well, it is mine, and you will give it...
You will give it to me.
Queenie, you mustn't go.
Queenie, you can't go.
Eddie, stop her.
- Queenie, just a moment, Queenie.
- Get your hands off me.
You're not gonna leave except with me and Hank.
- You get out of my way.
- You heard what I said.
You can't get away with it.
I'll kill that guy just as sure as anything.
I'll make him suffer the way he's making me suffer.
- You can't go, Queenie.
Gonna stay right here. No.
I've heard all I'm gonna hear from either of you. You've said enough.
- I'd like to see you kill anybody.
- Queenie.
You dirty, cheap little songwriter, you.
Queenie, Queenie!
- Say, what kind of a sap are you, anyway?
You gonna let a john like that steal her from you because he's got a little more jack?
Well, if you do, all I can say is you're a rotten quitter.
Oh, don't lie to me.
Say, if I loved a girl like you do Queenie I'd fight for her.
What's the matter with you? Where's your nerve?
- But, Hank, you don't...
- Oh, don't pass the buck to me.
What do you think I've been meaning all along?
I was on the level with this thing?
That I was in love with you?
That's a hot one.
I just been playing you for all I could get out of you for the act.
- You been kidding me all the time?
- Sure, I been kidding you.
Say, I wouldn't marry you if you was the last man on earth.
And at that, I ain't so sure you're the right guy for her.
You're afraid of Jock Warriner, or you'd go out and fight for her.
- But you're just yellow.
- You think I'm yellow?
- Sure, you're yellow.
- I'll show you how much I'm yellow.
You hear me? You're yellow.
- I'm yellow? - Yes, you are.
You're yellow!
You're yellow.
Oh, Eddie, you're not yellow.
You're white.
Murray Hill-8400.
Hello, Uncle Jed?
Say, I've decided to take those 30 weeks.
You can team me up with that blond.
I'm breathless.
Oh, I don't know what to say.
Oh, I can't thank you enough.
It's not half good enough for you.
I want you to have everything in the world.
I want you to meet my girlfriend.
- Come on, let's go back to the party.
- Oh, Queenie, not yet.
Why, I haven't had you to myself for a moment tonight.
Oh, but I'd rather go back, please.
Wait, Queenie.
I have so many things I want to tell you alone.
Oh, well, you can tell me out there.
Wait a minute, Queenie.
I've done all these things for you.
Aren't you going to be nice to me?
- Oh, Jock, let me go.
- Why should I let you go?
- Please let me go, please.
- No, I won't let you go.
You're going to stay right here with me.
- No, I'm not gonna stay here with you.
- Yes, you are.
- I will keep you here.
You won't keep me here, do you hear me?
- I won't let you go.
I won't stay with you another minute.
- I told you not to come here.
- Oh, Eddie, take me away.
What do you mean coming in here?
- I won't before I'm finished with you.
- Oh, Eddie, let's go.
- Now that you've found me what do you want?
- I'll show you what I want.
Oh, darling, let me see you.
Oh, Eddie. Have they hurt you, sweetheart?
Have they?
You just hit him again if you dare. Just try it, that's all.
- Eddie, let me see you.
- Queenie, Queenie.
You don't realize what you're doing.
You let me go. And you can take your jewelry and your presents and everything.
I don't want anything to do with you.
Let me get a sock at that guy.
- No, Eddie don't...
- Let me get at him, just let me get at him.
- I wanna get at that guy.
- Throw him out.
- Out he goes.
- No, don't.
Don't let them.
Oh, Eddie.
Don't you do that to him.
What do you know about that guy?
Got rid of that guy anyhow.
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, dear.
You dirty bums, you.
- Oh, Eddie, have they hurt you?
- I'll bet you are.
I don't know why you feel sorry for anybody like me.
I can't even scrap a little.
I let a heel like that take a sock at me and get away with it.
Well, Eddie, he's bigger than you are.
- Yeah, a little bigger.
- And he's awfully strong.
I suppose you found that out from his hugs.
Well, if you couldn't stop them from throwing you out how could I stop him from hugging me?
Well, there's something in that.
I guess you'd better go home.
Oh, Eddie, aren't you gonna take me home?
- I'll take you home.
- Don't you like me anymore?
Why, Queenie, I...
They've hurt you, I know they have.
Oh, I'm all right, Queenie.
Now understand, it took six of them to throw me out.
Oh, what is it?
Oh, they'll be here any minute.
What does it...? What does it...?
"Arriving 2:30, wonderful honeymoon. See you the minute we get in.
Love to our Hank, Queenie and Eddie." Oh, I'm so excited. What time is it?
- 12:00 last night.
- It's what?
Well, what's the matter with this thing?
See who that is.
- Hello, Jed.
Oh, gee.
Well, well, Queenie.
Congratu...
- Oh, fine, Uncle Jed.
Oh, I'm great.
What's it going to be in the electric lights this time?
Queenie Kearns and Company?
I'm only gonna be connected with the stage by marriage.
Oh, Hank, we found the cutest little home down on Long Island.
- Where Eddie can work.
And say, when you're finished with this tour, you're coming to live with us.
Oh, nothing doing.
Hotels for mine, where I can get service.
- I'd be all out of step in a real home.
- What do you mean?
- You're coming to live with us, all right.
- I should say she is.
Just like a trouper.
Troupers are all tramps.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
No home, no nothing.
Hank, you're just a born trouper.
Doggone this weather. It certainly is tough on colds, isn't it?
Well, say, I want Queenie and Eddie to see the act.
Say, where is that blond, anyway?
Hank, you're a sight for sore eyes.
- Hello, Uncle Jed.
- Oh, hello, Flo.
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Oh, Eddie.
- Hello, Flo.
Oh, Eddie, tell me, did you have a good time on your honeymoon?
Oh, Eddie, when you open your new show gonna give me a job, aren't you?
Oh, you're grand.
Say, come on, stupid. Let's run through the act for them.
But, say, you know something?
She's a born trouper.
We're gonna break in the act and bring it to New York.
- That's great.
- Say, step on it, will you?
- I've got a matinee.
I want two choruses and you follow us, not us you.
- Come on, Flo.
Say, listen. There's gonna be no part in your show for that dame, get me?
It's kind of rough yet, but don't you say it's pretty good for an opening?
You know, if you don't hurry, you're gonna miss that train.
- Oh, the train.
- Sure, the train.
Oh, Hank. Hank, can I help you?
Yes, you could hold my coat for me.
I forgot all about the thing.
Oh, Hank.
That's all right, Queenie.
- Goodbye, Hank.
Oh, you'll write to me soon, won't you?
Yeah, I'll write you from Peoria.
Now, where's my hat? Where's my hat?
- Oh, where's my hat!
- Here's your hat.
Here. Here. Here's your valise.
- All right. Bring it, Uncle Jed. Come on.
- It's pretty heavy.
- Don't forget to write. Goodbye.
Oh, don't cry, dear.
Hank won't be gone long.
The season will be over before you know it, and she'll be back here with us.
It ain't that, honey.
But it seems like Hank ain't never had a real break.
And I guess I haven't done much to make her any happier.
I wouldn't feel that way about it, dear.
Hank'll be much happier back on the road. Why, she couldn't give it up.
She couldn't live without it.
And now that she knows you're taken care of...
People can't help falling in love.
It comes to you no matter what you do.
And I love you, dear.
Oh, and I love you, Eddie.
You were just meant for me.
Opening in Peoria.
Four shows a day.
Zanny said he'd make me a star in six months.
Say, listen, it's better to star in... In Oshkosh than to starve on Broadway.
That's a bunk.
Say, now you listen to me, stupid.
I'll handle things.
Yes, and I'll have you back on Broadway and in the Palace in less than six months.
- No fooling?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.
Sure, it's...
It's... It's in the can.

We wanna see you, Mr. Hammer.
Somebody pay their bill?
We want our money.
Yes, money.
You want your money?
We wanna get paid.
Oh, you want my money?
Do I want your money?
Suppose George Washington's soldiers had asked for money? Where would this country be today?
But they did ask.
And where's Washington?
No, money will never make you happy, and happy will never make you money.
That might be a wisecrack, but I doubt it.
I'll make you all a promise.
If you'll all stick with me and work hard, we'll forget about money.
Let's get together and we'll make a regular hotel out of this place.
I'll put writing paper in the hotel, and next year if you behave yourselves, I'll put in envelopes.
I'm gonna put extra blankets free in all your rooms. There'll be no cover charge.
Think of the opportunities here in Florida.
Three years ago I came to Florida without a nickel in my pocket.
And now I've got a nickel in my pocket.
That's all very well, Mr. Hammer, but we haven't been paid in two weeks and we want our wages.
Do you wanna be wage slaves?
No, of course not.
Well, what makes wage slaves?
Wages.
I want you to be free.
Remember there's nothing like liberty, except Colliers and the Saturday Evening Post.
One for all and all for me, and me for you and three for five and six for a quarter.
A couple of telegrams for you, Mr. Hammer.
Business is beginning to pick up already.
Now if you gir... boys will only be calm.
Uh-huh. " We arrive this afternoon on the 4:30.
Kindly reserve two floors and three ceilings." They must be mice.
"If we like your property, we will immediately buy it."
See that, things have started our way already.
Western Union, and they've got a lot of money too.
On the 4:15, eh?
Well, I'll take the bus down myself.
Here's another one, Mr. Hammer.
See, we're gonna be stuffed by tonight.
This hotel will be so crowded that we'll be turning away thousands of people.
"If there is another hotel in Cocoanut Beach, cancel our reservations."
It was too good.
Wait a minute. " P.S.
Aunt Fanny had an eight-pound boy.
Can you come to the wedding?"
You see, everything is all right, boys. Everything is all right.
You're all invited to the wedding of Aunt Fanny's eight-pound boy.
Oh, but that won't be for a couple of years yet.
In the meantime, I want you to buck up, get down to work.
Let's put this thing over with a bang.
And above all, forget about money.
Don't think of it. Just forget about it, because you won't get it anyway.
See that? I keep them dancing for their money.
Jamison, I'm going down to meet the 4:15.
If I never come back, you'll know I'm still waiting for the train. Yes, sir.
And in my absence, I'm relying on you to take good care of everything.
You can depend upon me, sir.
If any guests come in, take good care of them.
And think of me, Jamison.
You bet I will.
I'll be back someday.
Keep a light burning in the window, if you can find a window.
All right, sir. Good-bye.
Good-bye, Jamison.
Hello, Harvey.
Why so downhearted?
Is Bob Adams cutting you out with Polly Potter?
I'm not worried about a hotel clerk.
No, but I'll bet you're worried about the Potter millions.
You generally could use money in the old days.
Oh, lay off that stuff.
You know, marrying Polly is the only way for you to square your debts.
I can take care of myself.
Suppose I have a little plan that'll take care of both of us.
Have you ever seen that diamond necklace of Mrs. Potter's?
You bet I have.
Her room and my room are right next to each other.
Hers is 318; mine, 320.
The door between is unlocked.
Well? She keeps everything in a jewel case locked up in her dresser.
The key is always in her bag.
That's what you've got to get.
It's a large order, but maybe it can be done.
Suppose I invite Mrs. Potter and Polly to take supper with me tonight?
Sometime during the evening... I might be able to get the key out of her bag.
Now you're talking.
That sounds more like old times.
And now I will try and get rid of Bob Adams for you.
Look, this is Cocoanut Manor.
You know that hill?
Do I know that cunning little hill?
It's cunning, all right. But that's why there hasn't been any development here.
Couldn't it be cut down?
Too expensive.
Now, here's what happened.
John W. Berryman was here to see it last month.
You know, Berryman practically built Palm Beach and Miami, but he said he wouldn't touch this.
Now when a man like that passes a place up, no one wants it.
Do you know anything about architecture?
No, but I'd love to learn.
Well, I made a drawing of the whole place showing the hills. It's a built-up scheme, without cutting down the hill or having it get in the way.
I made the hill fit in with the architectural scheme.
I sent Berryman a copy last week, and his secretary wrote me a nice note saying they were studying my plans.
That's thrilling.
Does Mr. Hammer know about it?
But if he takes it, I'll design the buildings.
Say, I may be an architect yet.
If he only does, I'm sure it will be the most beautiful place in the world.
It would be... if you lived there.
Look, see what I've written?
"Heaven for Polly and me."
When do I move in?
Any day now.
It's a lovely dream, Bob.
Let's make it come true.
The skies Will all be blue
When my dreams Come true
And I'll be smiling Through
That Spanish castle I built in my mind
Will be a love nest
The practical kind And I'll be there With you
Ever since I met you
All that I seem to do Is dream
Wonderful dreams
Heaven's before my eyes
When will I realize My dreams
Will be a love nest The practical kind
And I'll be there
When my dreams
Come
Will you look at that?
I am looking.
Well, it's darn cute.
I wonder who it can be.
Then little Red Riding Hood said to the wolf, "Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf."
Hello. How do you do, Miss Potter? Hello.
Your mother is looking for you, Polly.
She generally is, and she generally finds me.
You know Mother.
It was a lovely story, Mr. Adams.
I'd like to hear the rest of it sometime.
I wonder if I could hear it sometime.
How about you, Yates?
You know what happens to bad little boys who tell stories?
They marry the beautiful princess.
And I'll be there With you
Come True
Nice boy.
The kind who usually gets what he wants.
I might win out yet.
Well, miracles do happen.
Well, Polly, you've been out again with Mr. Adams.
But only for a little while, Mother.
Why a daughter of mine should fool around with a hotel clerk... when she has the opportunity of marrying one of the Boston Yates... is more than I can understand,
Oh, who cares about the Boston Yates?
Anyway, Bob isn't a clerk. He's an architect.
He's only clerking until he can get started.
One who clerks, Polly, is a clerk, and that settles it.
And I want you to remember that no Potter... has ever been involved in a single scandal.
How about Uncle Dick?
Polly, it's a well-known fact... that your uncle was drunk at the time.
And another thing, young lady, I'm quite tired of your sitting out on the beach... all hours of the night.
Why don't you take something for that insomnia?
You ought to cut out drinking so much coffee.
I'm sorry, sir. Say, any luck with the 4:30?
Yes, it didn't hit me.
That's the only luck I had with it.
Mr. Hammer, I think I know what's wrong with the hotel.
I think I know too.
You're fired. Get your hat and my coat and get out.
Maybe the season hasn't started yet.
Maybe the hotel hasn't opened yet.
Don't worry, Mr. Hammer.
In a few weeks you'll be cleaning up.
Yes, and making the beds.
I can handle this rush myself.
600 rooms in the hotel and you have to sleep here.
How do you do, Mr. Hammer?
Why don't you whistle at the crossing?
You're just the woman I'm looking for.
Now whether you like it or not, I'm gonna tell you about Florida real estate.
It's the first time it's ever been mentioned down here, today.
Do you know that this is the biggest development since Sophie Tucker?
Do you know that Florida is the show spot of America and Cocoanut Beach is the black spot of Florida?
You told me about this yesterday.
I know, but I left out a comma.
Look. In a little while we're gonna hold an auction sale at Cocoanut Manor, the suburb terrible... uh, beautiful.
You must come over.
There's gonna be entertainment, sandwiches and the auction.
If you don't like auctions, we can play contract.
Here it is.
Cocoanut Manor, 42 hours from Times Square by railroad.
1,600 miles as the crow flies, 1,800 as the horseflies.
There you are, Cocoanut Manor glorifying the American sewer and the Florida sucker.
Why, it's the most exclusive residential district in Florida.
Nobody lives there.
And the climate... Ask me about the climate, I dare you.
Very well.
How... I'm glad you brought it up.
Our motto is, Cocoanut Beach... no snow, no ice and no business.
Do you know that Florida is the greatest state in the Union?
Is it? Take its climate.
No, we took that.
Take its fruits, take the alligator pears.
Take all the alligator pears and keep 'em.
Do you know how alligator pears are made?
Haven't the slightest idea.
That's because you've never been an alligator, and don't let it happen again.
Do you know that it sometimes requires years to bring the pear and the alligator together?
They don't like each other.
No. No.
Do you know how many alligator pears are sent out of this state every year and told not to come back?
I don't think I do.
All they can get a hold of.
Florida feeds the nation, but nobody feeds me and that's what I wanna talk to you about.
Mr. Hammer... Another thing, take our cattle raising.
I don't mean anything personal.
But here is the ideal cattle raising section.
We have longhorns, shorthorns and shoehorns.
Mr. Hammer, will you let me say something, please?
I hardly think so, and there's something else I wanna bring to your mind.
Where will you be when you're 65?
That's only about three months from now.
If I were to buy, I should prefer someplace like Palm Beach.
The Atlantic City of yesterday?
The slums of tomorrow?
Do you know that the population of Cocoanut Beach has doubled in the past week?
Three bulldogs were born.
We're expecting a nanny goat in the morning.
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I must be going.
Aw, now, don't go.
Before you go, let me show you a sample of our sewer pipe we're gonna lay.
Look at it. Nobody could fool you on a sewer pipe, can they, a woman like you?
Now this is the eight-inch pipe.
But of course, all property owners will be allowed to vote on the size of their pipe.
In case of a tie, it goes to the Supreme Court, and I can give you a little inside information in advance.
The chief justice is crazy about this type of sewer.
Here, put it in your pocket.
Mr. Hammer, I can't use this.
Hello.
Yes? Ice water in 318?
Where'd you get it?
Oh, you want some?
Have you got any ice?
This is Cocoanut Beach... no snow, no ice.
Get some onions.
That'll make your eyes water.
Oh, Mr. Hammer.
Mrs. Thompson wants to know... if you'd reserve a table for dinner for her in a nice quiet spot.
A nice quiet spot? Yeah.
Tell her she can eat in the lobby.
We ought to dress this place up a bit.
It looks terrible.
Front.
Front. Here, front.
Jamison, what's become of our front?
Are we all out of front? I haven't seen 'em.
I'm gonna fire some of those people.
Give me the fire bell.
Why don't you stick around here.
If anybody comes in that looks like a customer, tie 'em and brand 'em. Yes, sir.
He's dressed better than I am.
Hey, come on.
Hey, come here. Come here.
- Gentlemen, how do you do?
- How do you do?
Are you boys giving me the runaround?
Explain your business.
We send you a telegram. Oh, you're the boys that sent the telegram?
How do you do?
That's a coincidence.
I used to send telegrams myself.
That's all right.
Say, you can stay, but you'll have to take that groundhog out of here. Now what do you want?
Explain your business.
We make a "reservash." "Reservash"?
Yes. We want a room and no bath.
Oh, I see. You're just here for the winter.
Well, step this way and I'll see what I can do for you.
All right. We stay for the summer too.
I'm sorry, boys, but we haven't got any vacancies.
He's got no vacancies?
We got plenty of rooms.
That's all right, we take a room.
All right, we take a vacancy.
Boy, take the gentlemen's baggage.
Hey, what are you...
Hey, hey, do you know that suitcase is empty? That's all right.
We'll fill it up before we leave.
Oh, you will, eh? Well, you'll empty it before I go out.
Step this way, boys.
Just put your moniker on there and everything will be "A.K."
Look what he do.
Step right this way, boy.
Three shots for five.
He never misses.
This boy wins the gold cigar.
Anybody else? Step right this way.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't throw that. That's only for long distance.
Would you like a suite on the third floor?
No, I'll take a Polack in the basement.
You'll have to take that up with the commissary department.
That's an entirely different proposition and I can't...
Let me help you here.
The afternoon mail isn't in yet.
I can use you the first of the month.
Telegram for Mr. Hammer.
Telegram?
Just tell them I'll send them the money in the morning.
Now then, what do you want?
What do you want? Do you want a single room?
We'd like to double up.
Well, eat some green apples.
Just a joke.
You'll have to talk louder.
If you'll take your nose out of the receiver, it'll be okay.
Funny fella, you.
Hello.
What's that? You wanna know where you can get a hold of Mrs. Potter?
I don't know.
She's awfully ticklish.
Now, I'm in a position, gentlemen...
He's a hungry.
Here, have one of these flowers.
They're buckwheat.
Pick out a nice one now.
I don't want you to get any of the worst ones.
There you are. I'm so glad.
Now, if you boys will pardon me for a few moments, I have some very important business to attend to.
As a matter of fact, I'm going upstairs to get your partner a stomach pump.
He needs one. And I'll be down in a few minutes.
And while I'm gone, don't forget.
Register.
Hey, don't forget.
Register.
Hello. No, we no got a no rooms.
We got a nothing.
We got a no customers. We got a nothing.
I send you up a some.
All right, good-bye.
Did you ring, sir?
Come on. Come here.
Come here. Get away from those girls.
All right then, but let's be careful.
I will. Tell me, how is it that the door between your room and Mrs. Potter's is open?
Well, you see, I told her that I trusted her.
You trusted her?
Hey, stop that.
Come on.
We dance.
Really! Come, Penelope.
Let's get away from this... bum.
I could kill those tramps.
Don't kill them yet.
About them?
Listen. When the necklace is found missing, someone's got to be blamed.
Why not them?
Gee, that's not bad.
But have you got anything definite?
Suppose I flirt with them and they come to my room.
I'll complain to the management.
Then on the night the necklace disappeared they were seen near Mrs. Potter's.
Get it?
You bet I get it.
That's a grand idea.
Thanks, kind sir.
Well, I've got to run along now.
Hey, hey, what you do, eh?
All the time you eat.
That's a no good.
We gotta get the money.
Right now I'd do anything for money. I'd kill somebody for money.
I'd kill you for money.
Oh, no, you're my friend.
I kill you for nothin'.
What do you laugh, eh?
You're in the hotel three hours and you no got a something yet.
What do you got?
A beautiful watch.
That's a fine.
That's a fine. That's all you steal?
I think I know your face.
I give up.
Whose is it?
I'll tell you in a minute.
I brought some pictures from headquarters.
Yours too.
All right. All right. I make my own face.
Why you push, huh? No pushing.
You wanna fight? Come on.
Come on.
That's no funny. You fight upstairs.
What are you guys fighting for? We no fight.
That's a my friend.
We play this way.
What are you doing around here?
I'm pretty suspicious of you birds.
I haven't got anything on you yet, but I'm going to keep watching.
I've got your full records right here in my pocket.
There's enough to send you up the minute you start anything.
Do you get me?
Wise guy. Wise guy. Gotta start a fight when the detective come around.
You can't wait a little bit, huh?
A badge.
That's a fine. He's a no more detective.
You're a detective.
Hurry along, my dear.
Only a few minutes to get to the train.
Can you tell me what time is the next train to Philadelphia?
There's a train once a week and sometimes twice a day.
That's a fine.
It's a little tight. Needs something taken out.
All right, keep it.
That's just what I need... a coat like this.
That's a fine, huh, to look good.
That's a good-looking coat you have on.
You like it, huh?
Do you know you look like the prince of Wales?
Better. Where'd you get that coat?
That's a my coat.
That's your coat?
That's a my coat.
But it doesn't fit you.
I had it made to order.
Tell me, what are you doing tonight?
Maybe you got a good idea, eh?
Well, don't you dare come to room 320 at 11:00.
All right, I come half past 10:00.
Did you see a handkerchief?
I thought I dropped one.
Well, it really doesn't matter... because what I'm really interested in is you.
Did anyone ever tell you that you looked like the prince of Wales?
I thought it was an original idea of mine.
Tell me, do you know who I am?
Do you know my room number?
Well, I'll be there at 11:00 tonight.
Did anyone ever tell you you look like the prince of Wales?
I don't mean the present prince of Wales.
One of the old Wales. And believe me, when I say Wales, I mean Wales.
I know a whale when I see one.
Did you say your room was 318?
I'm the proprietor of this hotel and I have a passkey to every room in it.
Passkey?
Passkey, that's Russian for "pass."
You know they "passkey" down the "streetskey."
Won't you, uh, lie down?
Aw, if we could find a little bungalow, eh?
Of course, I know we could find one, but maybe the people wouldn't get out.
But if we could find a nice little empty bungalow just for me and you... where we could bill and cow...
No, where we could bull and cow.
Do you know what you're trying to say?
Yes, it's not what I'm thinking of.
What I meant was, if we had a nice little bungalow... and you was inside and I was outside trying to get in or inside trying to get out...
No, I was in... You was up...
You were inside out and I was up...
Uh, no... I'll tell you, if you don't hear from me by next Friday, the whole thing's off.
I mean, your eyes... your eyes, they shine like the pants of a blue serge suit.
That's an insult.
That's not a reflection on you.
That's on the pants.
What I meant was if we had a nice bungalow... and I came home from work and you were standing by the gate...
No, you came home from work and I was standing by the gate.
And we came down the path... and we went inside and the shades were drawn... and the lights were low, and, uh... then, uh...
Are you sure your husband's dead?
There seems to be a trace of uncertainty in that "yes."
You know, a yes like that was once responsible for me jumping out of a window.
And I'm not the jumper I used to be.
What I meant was, you're gonna be here all winter and I'm stuck with the hotel anyhow, why don't you grab me until you can make other arrangements?
My dear, Mr. Hammer, I shall never get married before my daughter.
You did once.
Oh, but I love you.
I love you. Can't you see how I'm pining for you?
What in the world is the matter with you?
Oh, I'm not myself tonight.
One false move and I'm yours.
I love you. I love you anyhow.
I don't think you'd love me if I were poor.
I might, but I'd keep my mouth shut.
I'll not stay here any longer and be insulted this way.
No, don't go away and leave me here alone.
You stay here and I'll go away.
Say that you'll be truly mine, or truly yours or yours truly.
Don't you know that I'm...
Will you keep your hands to yourself!
Come on. I'll play you one more game.
Can you come down a little bit?
Just think, tonight... tonight... when the moon is sneaking around the clouds, I'll be sneaking around you.
I'll meet you tonight under the moon.
Oh, I can see you now... you and the moon.
You wear a necktie so I'll know you.
Send up some ice water right away.
Did you get the key?
Yes. It's one of these.
Now, listen. We can't take any chances on this job.
There's bound to be trouble when she misses the necklace. Well?
We can't have it found on us.
I should say not.
We've got to play it safe and hide it somewhere for a while.
Hide it?
Just for a few days.
Yes, but where?
Anywhere but in here.
Hide it?
I know just the place.
A hollow tree stump about a mile from here.
Fine, but how do I get there?
It's Cocoanut Manor.
You've been out there.
I'm not so sure, Harvey.
Here, I'll show you.
Now, you... you go right out Cocoanut Road.
Then there's Augustine Road, like this, but instead, you take the Granada Road.
Suddenly, you come to a clearing with a fringe of trees around it.
That's Cocoanut Manor where the stump is.
It's about 20 feet from the edge of the clearing.
That's where you put the jewels.
You can't miss it.
Now you take the necklace right out there, see?
I've got to go back downstairs, or Mrs. Potter will be suspicious.
And be careful.
Cocoanut Manor, Granada Road, 20 feet from the clearing.
Everything's going along swimmingly now.
Do you remember me? The prince of Wales? Why, yes, of course I do...
Mr. Hammer, how dare you come into my room?
If there's gonna be two people in this room, it'll be 50 cents extra.
Anybody.
Oh, Prince, how you frightened me.
This hotel not only has running water, it has running guests.
Do you remember me? Prince of Wales? - Who is it?
- It's me, the king of England.
My father!
Ice water.
Put it there.
Thank you. "Thank you"?
Why didn't you give him a dime?
Lay down.
Well, I never. I should say not.
Get out.
What is the matter with that man?
Mr. Hammer, what are you doing in my room?
Don't you dare take that coat off in this room.
You get out of here as fast as you can go.
I was only playing, that's all.
I'll find out about this outfit.
Thank goodness he's gone.
Never mind, Operator.
That's all right.
I'll be through in a minute.
- Well, I guess there's nobody in here.
- You don't know where to look.
What's that you said?
Oh, this is awful.
When you've quite finished, let me know.
Well, everything seems to be all right in here.
Now listen to me. I'm not gonna have that red-headed fellow running around the lobby.
If you wanna keep him up in the room, you'll have to keep him in a trap.
I can't catch him.
That's a my partner, but he no speak.
Oh, that's your silent partner.
Well, anyhow, you wired me about some property. I've thought it over.
Now, I can let you have three lots watering the front, or I can let you have three lots fronting the water.
Now, these lots cost me $ 9,000 and I'm gonna let you have them for 15 because I like you.
I no buy nothing.
I ain't got a no money.
You got a no money?
I no got a one cent.
How are you gonna pay for your room? That's your lookout.
Oh, you're just an idle "roomer."
Well, you see, we come here to make money.
I read in the paper and it say, "Big Boom In Florida." So we come.
We're a couple of big booms too.
I'll show you how you can make some real money.
I'm going to hold an auction in a little while in Cocoanut Manor.
You know what an auction is, eh?
I come from Italy on the Atlantic Auction.
Well, let's go ahead as if nothing happened.
I say I'm holding an auction at Cocoanut Manor.
And when the crowd gathers around, I want you to mingle with them.
Don't pick their pockets, just mingle with them...
I'll find time for both.
Well, maybe we can cut out the auction.
Here's what I mean. If somebody says $100, you say two.
If somebody says two, you say three.
Bid up. That's right.
Now, if nobody says anything, then you start it off.
How am I gonna know when they no say nothin'?
Well, they'll probably notify you.
You fool, if they don't say anything, you'll hear 'em, won't you?
Well, maybe I no listen.
Well, don't tell 'em.
Now then, if we're successful in disposing of these lots, I'll see that you get a nice commission.
And how about some money?
Well, you can have your choice.
Now, in arranging these lots, of course, we use blueprints.
You know what a blueprint is, huh?
It's oysters.
How is it you never got double pneumonia?
I go around by myself.
Do. You know what a lot is?
Yeah, it's too much.
I don't mean a whole lot.
Just a little lot with nothing on it.
Anytime you got a too much, you got a whole lot.
Look, I explain it to you.
Sometimes you no got a enough. Sometimes you got a whole lot.
Sometimes you got a little bit. You no think it's enough.
Somebody else maybe think it's a too much.
It's a whole lot too.
Now, a whole lot is a too much, too much is a whole lot.
The next time I see you, remind me not to talk to you, will you?
All right... Come over here, Rand McNally, and I'll explain this thing to you.
Now look, this is a map and diagram of the whole Cocoanut section.
This whole area is within a radius of approximately three-quarters of a mile.
Radius.
Is there a remote possibility that you know what radius means?
It's a W.J.Z. Well, I walked right into that one.
It's gonna be a cinch explaining the rest of this thing to you, I can see that.
I catch on quick.
That's a rodeo you're thinking of.
Look, Einstein.
Here's Cocoanut Manor.
No matter what you say, this is Cocoanut Manor.
Here's Cocoanut Heights.
That's a swamp.
And right over here where the road forks, that's Cocoanut Junction.
Where have you got Cocoanut Custard?
That's on one of the forks.
You probably eat with your knife, so you won't have to worry about that.
Now, here is the main road leading out of Cocoanut Manor.
That's the road I wish you were on.
Now, over here on this site we're gonna build an eye and ear hospital.
This is gonna be a sight for sore eyes.
Now, right over here, this is the residential section.
People live there, huh?
No, that's the stockyards.
Now all along here, this is the riverfront, and all along the river... all along the river, those are all levees.
That's the Jewish neighborhood?
Well, we'll pass over that.
You're a peach, boy.
Now, here is a little peninsula, and here is a viaduct leading over to the mainland.
Why a duck?
I'm all right.
I say here is a little peninsula, and here's a viaduct leading over to the mainland.
Why a duck?
I'm not playing Ask Me Another.
I say that's a viaduct.
Why a duck? Why a duck? Why a no chicken?
I don't know why a no chicken.
I'm a stranger here myself.
All I know is that it's a viaduct.
You try to cross over there a chicken, and you'll find out viaduct.
I no go someplace...
It's deep water, that's why a duck.
It's deep water.
That's why a duck. Look, rube.
Suppose you were out horseback riding... and you came to that stream and wanted to ford over. You couldn't make it.
But what do you want with a Ford if you got a horse?
Well, I'm sorry the matter ever came up.
All I know is that it's a viaduct.
Look. All right.
I catch on to why a horse, why a chicken, why a this, why a that.
I no catch on to why a duck.
Well, I was only fooling. I was only fooling.
They're gonna build a tunnel there in the morning.
Now, is that clear to you?
Yes, everything except why a duck.
Then we can go ahead with this thing.
Now, look, I'm gonna take you down and show you our cemetery.
I've got a waiting list of 50 people at that cemetery just dying to get in.
But I like you. You're my friend.
I like you and I'm gonna shove you in ahead of all of them.
I know you like me.
I'm gonna see that you get a steady position.
That's a good.
And if I can arrange it, it'll be horizontal.
Now remember, when the auction starts, if somebody says $100...
I say 200.
That's grand.
Now, if somebody says 200.
I say 300.
Now, you know how to get down there? No...
Now, look.
You go down there, down that narrow path there... until you come to that little jungle there. You see it?
Where those thatched palms are.
Yes, I see.
And then there's a little clearing there... a little clearing with a wire fence around it.
You see that wire fence there?
All right. Why a fence?
Oh, no, we're not gonna go all through that again.
You come along with me and I'll fix you up.
Bid 'em up. Go higher.
One say 100, 2... 200, 300.
That's it. If somebody says $100, you say 200.
If somebody says two, you say three.
Help me put this deal over, you can have anything you got.
I got a nothing.
Be alert. That's it.
Be alert. Be alert, or papa don't go out at all.
I be alert. I don't know what it is, but I be it.
All ye suckers who are gonna get trimmed, step this way for the big swindle.
Ladies and gentlemen, before proceeding with the main business of the day, which is the selling of these lots at any price, we're gonna have a little entertainment... very little.
I wanna present to you Miss Polly Potter, the best paying guest in the hotel.
In fact, the only paying guest in the hotel.
She will sing for you and for me too.
Monkeys upon a tree Never are very blue
They never seem to be Under par That is true
Not like the ones you see On a bar in the zoo
Monkeys upon a tree Do the monkey doodle doo
Oh, among the mangoes where the monkey gang goes

And then let's go, my little dearie Here's the Darwin theory
Telling me and you
That's Florida, folks...
singing, dancing and entertainment.
After the entertainment, there'll be sandwiches.
But remember, if there are no lots sold, there will be no sandwiches.
Florida, folks... sunshine, sunshine.
Perpetual sunshine all the year around.
Let's get the auction started before we get a tornado.
Step forward, everybody.
Friends, you are now in Cocoanut Manor, one of the finest cities in Florida.
Of course, we still need a few finishing touches, but who doesn't?
This is the heart of the residential district. Every lot is a stone's throw from the station.
As soon as they throw enough stones, we're gonna build a station.
800 wonderful residences will be built right here.
Why, they're as good as up. Better.
You can have any kind of a home you want to.
You can even get stucco.
Oh, how you can get stuck, oh.
Now is the time to buy while the new boom is on.
Remember that old saying, "a new boom sweeps clean"?
And don't forget the guarantee... my personal guarantee.
If these lots don't double in value in a year, I don't know what you can do about it.
Now, we'll take lot number 20, right at the corner of DeSota Avenue.
Of course, you all know who DeSota was?
He discovered a body of water.
You've all heard of the water that they named after him...
DeSota Water.
Now this lot has a 20-foot frontage, a 14-foot "backage" and a mighty fine gobbet.

Wrap up that lot and put some poison ivy on it. Yes, sir.
Well, I came out even on that one.
That was a big success.
Yeah, one more success like that and I'll sell my body to a medical institute.
Now, we'll take lot number 21.
There it is, right over there, folks.
Right where that coconut tree is.

I'll go to high school. Does anybody wanna buy a lead pencil?
I'll wrestle anybody in the crowd for five dollars.
Well, if there's not gonna be any more bidding, I might as well quit.
Can't you visualize bargains? Don't you wanna make money?
I'm gonna try one more lot, and if I don't dispose of this, I'm gonna fold up.
You get me? We're gonna take lot number 26, the star lot of the whole proceedings.

Sold to Mr. Adams for $1,200.
And a mighty fine piece of property you got there, buddy.
Oh, Bob, you've got it!
Make a note of that.
I protest against that.
I didn't have a chance to bid.
What do you mean? I want you to understand I don't discriminate.
You had the same opportunity as everybody else.
Mr. Hammer, I've been robbed.
What?
My necklace in your hotel...
Oh, Mother.
It's worth $100,000.
"Was it valuable"?
I'll give a thousand dollars' reward for its return.
You hear that? This little lady has lost a necklace worth $100,000, and she offers a thousand dollars' reward for its return.
2,000.
Sold for $ 2,000.
Comin' through.
I'll take charge of this.
All you people get back and give us plenty of room and keep quiet.
Cut that out.
Get back, everybody.
What, he hurt you?
No push, boy.
Start fighting.
Mr. Hammer, what's the matter with him?
I don't know where he's from.
He hasn't any license on him.
Yes, that's it. That's it.
You dear man.
I must kiss you again.
I saw you in that room last night.
Grabbing off stuff for the reward, eh?
Now then, you, come clean. Hey!
Leave him go. Come on. Leave him go.
How'd you know that necklace was there?
Officer, may I make a suggestion?
Isn't it possible that the gentleman who bought this lot might know something about it?
Why was he so anxious to buy it? How about it, you?
Why did you buy this lot?
He is a desperate character.
Mother, he isn't.
Whenever a fella shuts up and won't say anything, I've noticed it's generally on account of a woman.
You won't say anything.
This guy's letting on to be a dummy.
This bird you can't understand when he does talk.
Is there anybody here who will talk?
I will, but I can't think of anything.
Well, if you won't tell me about it, you'll tell somebody else.
You mean to say that...
That's enough.
Come on. Please. Please don't take him.
I didn't want you to steal it, Bob.
I had no idea that you'd do it.
Oh, I feel awful.
Bob, what does she mean?
Oh, it's all my fault.
I had no idea he'd think that I meant it.
I didn't want you to do it. I just meant that you could give me one like it.
Are you accusing me of taking Mrs. Potter's necklace?
I'm taking all the blame myself.
I was joking, and you took me seriously.
Bob, last night when you told me that you'd taken it, I just couldn't believe it.
Told you I'd taken what?
Why, Polly, she's out of her mind.
It sounds quite plausible to me.
I begged him to take it back.
Say, I'm not gonna stand for any more of this.
Why, the whole thing is ridiculous.
It's absurd!
Do you people really think for one moment that...
I don't care what you think, any of you.
Polly, you know it's a lie, don't you?
It was just a harmless flirtation, and then, well, he lost his head.
Don't you know it's a lie?
You don't think I'd believe a silly story like that, do you?
Polly. Mother, I don't believe it!
Mr. Adams, I must ask you never to speak to my daughter again. But, Mrs. Potter...
Bob, I'm going with you.
You'll stay here.
Yes, Polly.
It's only for a little while.
Why, the whole thing is ridiculous.
You ready?
Oh, I'm so sorry, Bob.
Don't keep it up any longer.
I'll have a confession out of him in half an hour.
Come on, you.
Bob!
Will you come back here. Now we'll take lot number 27.
I've been so unsuccessful in disposing these other lots, that I'm gonna give away a half a pound of tea with every lot I sell from now on.
There's only one way to wipe out this disgrace.
You must make people forget that you ever knew this young man.
You see what's come of your way. Now I'm going to have mine.
Mr. Yates?
Yes, Mrs. Potter?
My daughter has reconsidered her answer to you.
Your engagement will be announced tonight.
That's wonderful, Polly.
I shall give a dinner at the hotel...
A dinner? A dinner?
You want the 30- or 40-cent dinner?
You may invite everyone.
It's 50 with Jell-O, and, oh, how you can Jell-O.
In honor of the engagement of my daughter to Mr. Harvey Yates. I see.
Let me be the last to congratulate you, and you too.
I'm sure you'll have a very dismal wedding.
Congratulations, Yates.
Congratulations, Polly.
Coming, Polly?
In a minute.
Please go ahead.
Why, what's the matter, dear?
Please go.
You got the key? That's fine.
Hey, wait, wait.
Look. I got the saw.
Now, you gotta get a something.
We get a Bob out.
Hey, Bob. Hello.
What are you doing here?
How do you do? I didn't know they allowed visitors here.
I'm a no visitor. We come to get you out.
We gotta be quick too.
Thanks very much. You shouldn't have bothered.
I might as well stay here as any other place.
You gotta come out.
Uh... Polly, she wants you.
Polly wants me?
She gotta have you because tonight she's gonna be engaged.
Engaged?
Yes, gonna be married.
Mrs. Potter, she's gonna give a big engagement dinner.
To Polly.
He's engaged to Polly.
Everybody's gonna be there.
Polly's gonna marry Yates?
That's right. That's right.
Let me outta here. Get me out of here quick.
We get you out.
Hey, paesan.
Hurry up. Quick, quick.
Now we get you out.
I don't want anything to eat.
Not at a time like this.
Come on. Hurry up.
We get you out.
What's a matter?
What a you do, eh? Come on.
Break a the lock.
Come on.
What's the matter?
What's a matter for you?
Stop fighting. Stop fighting!
This is no time to fight.
Get me out of here, quick.
Hurry up, Bob.
Everybody's away.
Well, I'll attend to that.
It's been reported to me there's a poker game going on in room 420.
Go up there and knock on the door and see if you can get me a seat.
All right, Bob.
Nobody around.
Here he is. We got him.
We got him, all right.
Are you out on parole? No.
These two gentlemen helped me to get out.
I'm ever so much obliged to you, Mr. Hammer.
They told me it was your idea.
I can't begin to thank you.
That's all right. Maybe you do as much for me sometime.
Well, arrivederci.
Arrivederci. I can't begin to thank you.
Why, that's polygamy.
Believe me, it's no fun being in jail.
Jail is no place for a young fella.
There's no advancement.
But seriously, Mr. Hammer, you know that story of Penelope's was all a lie, don't you?
Now, what's the use of worrying?
It's silly to worry, isn't it? You're gone today and here tomorrow.
But you know it was a lie. How am I gonna prove it?
Well, of course...
"Silent Red wanted by the police."
Everything's been dropping from on high here.
Grapefruit.
Well, I hope I still got my underwear on.
Come here with that.
I felt kind of flimsy.
Bob. Yes, sir.
Go upstairs and count the rooms.
I think the third floor is missing.
I'll put this stuff in here until I get ready to go upstairs.
"Blackstone Hotel, Chicago."
"Statler Hotel, Cleveland"?
Can you imagine that?
More papers than any man I've ever knew.
"Granada Road.
Cocoanut Road."
"Granada Road, Cocoanut..."
"Granada..."
Hey, if you get it twice more, you're allowed to keep it.
Come here with that, will you.
You can beat that, but you can't tie it.
"Granada Road..." Don't, don't...
He'll take the words right out of your mouth. "Granada..."
Cocoanut Road.
Hollow stump.
Jewels."
Tell me, where did you find this?
That's a great guy you picked to ask.
Mr. Hammer, whoever drew this knows something about that robbery. Look.
And I'll be smiling
Will be our love nest The practical kind
And I'll Be there With you
When my dreams Come
Penelope, dear, so good of you to come.
Thanks so much, Mrs. Potter.
Oh, isn't it lovely.
You're a lucky boy, Harvey.
I know the party is going to be a great success.
Hello, Penelope.
I didn't know you were going to be here.
Anywhere that you are.
Is Mr. Hammer coming?
Mr. Hammer?
He'll be here directly.
Mr. Hammer, your costume is wonderful.
This costume has been condemned by Good Housekeeping.
I love the color scheme. That isn't a scheme.
It's a conspiracy.
Senor Chico Joseph Maria de Accunia, Count de Elsinore.
On Track 25.
Listen, Count. As soon as the guests leave, I'd like you to take the ashes out.
His Excellency, the ambassador from San Rafaelo,
Senor de Harpeno.
Hey, nix on that stuff.
Sure, and it's just a breath of old Ireland.
I can see me old mother comin' down the old path.
And I can see in the mornin'.
Diddly doo Whoo, goes the weasel
There goes the weasel now.
I'm awfully glad you came, Mr. Hennessy. That's all right, madam.
At a party like this, you've got to have the law around.
Now, a nice woman like you needs protection, and I'm here to see that you get it.
There's a couple of shady characters hanging around that I'm going to keep an eye on.
What's that you gave him?
I no give a nothing.
Give me that, I tell you!
Who got my shirt?
What's become of my shirt?
I want my shirt.
Hey, you've lost your shirt.
Uh, can you describe this shirt?
This cross... This cross marks the spot where the shirt was last seen.
Now, remain quiet, will you please?
You birds are all in on this thing, and you're all trying to keep me from finding my shirt.
That's a lie, you whelp.
Whelp, whelp, whelp, whelp, whelp.
Whelp, whelp, whelp. I want my shirt.
He wants his shirt.
He wants his shirt
I want my shirt.
He wants his shirt.
He wants his shirt
I want my shirt I want my shirt I can't be happy without my shirt
He wants his shirt He wants his shirt
He can't be happy without his shirt
I want my shirt He wants his shirt
He won't be happy till he has... his shirt
He's got it, he's got it He's got it, he's got it I've got my shirt back
Thank God, I've got my shirt I've got my shirt He's got it, he's got it, he's got it I've got my shirt
You'll never know how deeply I was hurt He's got it, he's got it, he's got it
I thought I'd lost my shirt He's got it, he's got it he's got it, he's got it
It was given to me by my brother Bert His brother Bert
That's why I love this shirt
The beautiful shirt My shirt
The wonderful shirt
Now that I've found my shirt
And now, friends, now that we've found Hennessy's shirt, would you all mind looking for a collar button that I lost here?
Size 131/2.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you'll all find places at the table, we'll have a short entertainment before supper.
Eat, eat, eat.
How about you and I giving this joint the air and indulging in some snappy necking?
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Hammer will now act as master of ceremonies.
Mr. Hammer.
Ladies and gentlemen... Two hundred dollars.
In behalf of the Rotary Club of Minneapolis, I want to take this occasion of welcoming you to Waukegan.
No, no, I mean, in recognition of my many years of service with the railroad, you have presented me with these ties.
And that, of course, reminds me of the story of the Irishman.
I wish I could think of it.
Oft in the stilly night, the trembling of a leaf can be heard... sighing through the trees.
And the babbling brook, as it wends its way onward, babbling and...
Well, I got rid of one.
And one like that is worth three ordinary ones.
Oh, yes, on this chair. That's right.
Western cattle opened at 15 and a quarter.
Yearlings and spring veal showed a firm tone.
And eggs were a little touchy on a falling market.
Well, my mother and father talked it over, and they finally moved to New York.
They took a little house in the Bronx. And it was in that little house that Abraham Lincoln was born, much to my father's surprise.
And that, boys and girls, was the beginning of the Lincoln Highway.
I now take great pleasure in presenting to you... the well-preserved and partially pickled Mrs. Potter.
Come on now. Give the little girl a big hand.
Speech. Speech. Big speech.
Speech. My good, good friends, if I could only tell you... how rosy-hued everything seems to me tonight.
As I look into your faces, they're all lit with gay laughter.
The whole world, and everything in it, is bathed in a soft, glowing, luminous haze.
The old gal is stewed to the eyebrows.
And now I want to wish you all a most enjoyable evening.
As for myself, I'm sad.
I simply can't go any farther.
I'll get off with you.
Now, friends, I want to take great pleasure in presenting to you... the groom Mr. Yates, Mr. Harvey Yates.
Good evening, radio fans.
We are now back in the studio.
Stand by for your station announcer.
My dear, dear friends,
I, uh, really don't know what to say.
Well, shut up.
What a splendid suggestion.
I feel highly honored, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a speech maker.
Nevertheless, Mr. Hammer, it was very nice of you to call on me.
You must call on me sometime.
I was just about to...
Yes, come up and see my flower bed.
What I intended to say...
I want you to see my pansies.
Well... I got short pansies and long pansies.
I was just going to say that...
Next spring I'm gonna get some early bloomers.
As I was about to say...
There seems to be a steady stream flowing in and out over there.
I wouldn't dream of taking up any more of your time.
I really wanted to thank you all. Yeah.
And as I said before, I hadn't intended to make a speech at all.
Now, friends...
Now what's the matter with him?
That's that good Gulf gas.
Mr. Hammer, can't you do something?
I don't have to.
They're doing plenty.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, the, uh... the first musical, uh, number that we intend to portray... will be the, uh, beginning and the ending of a very...
We're gonna have music. Music. We're gonna have music.
Now, the first musical number on the program... will be a piccolo solo which we will skip.
And the second number will be Senor Pastrami, the Lithuanian pianist.
The Senor, for his first selection, will play " A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and You"... from the opera, Aida.
Senor, allow me to escort you to the diet.
Uh, Senor Pastrami, what is the first number?
Number one.
And now, friends, I want to present to you a charming little lady.
Down in front.
The little lady who is to become Mrs. Harvey Yates, over my dead body.
What's wrong with you?
I know I have the sincere wishes of all my friends... and can only tell you how much I appreciate it.
I think I can honestly say this is the happiest moment of my life.
Look what I have here.
It's a little engagement present just given me by Mr. Yates.
He wrote it just now, but he wrote another yesterday when a necklace was stolen.
They are both in his handwriting.
Let me read it to you.
It shows how to get to Cocoanut Manor and the hollow tree stump... and reads, "Hollow stump, jewels."
I don't believe it.
See for yourself.
Yates is gone. Yates is gone?
And I gave him a check this morning for a thousand dollars.
It's a good thing it was my personal check.
There's a man outside who wants to see you with a black mustache.
Tell him I've got one.
Well, I think you will want to see him.
His name is Mr. John W. Berryman.
He has accepted my architectural plans for the development of Cocoanut Manor.
Well, happy days, old boy. Thank you.
He also wants to know if you can accommodate 400 guests for the weekend.
400 guests?
400 guests.
What in the world's the matter...
Mother, you must admit you were mistaken.
Mr. Adams, how can you ever forgive me?
Oh, please, Mrs. Potter.
Ladies and gentlemen, you're all invited to attend the wedding of my daughter.
The wedding will take place exactly as planned.
That is, with the exception of a slight change.
She will be married to Mr. Robert Adams.
When my dreams
Come true And I'll be smiling
Will be our love nest
The practical kind
And I'll Be there
True
ETERNAL LOVE
In the year 1806 France and Austria were at each other's throats; and Switzerland, lying squarely betweem the two became unwillingly a highroad for armies.
All residents of this district possessing firearms must surrender them at the Town Hall by ten o'Clock Sunday morning.
Any disobedience of this order will subject the entire community to severe punishment.
"We won't give up our guns!
We'll fight for our rights!"
"You must give them up!
What chances have we a mere handful... against a trained army?"
"Let us thank God that every man among us surrendered his gun to preserve our peace!"
"Is he here, Pia?"
"That's him!"
"What do you want?"
"I want you!"
"I know who they're for!
Father Tass' niece!"
"I'll get you yet, Marcus!"
"Why must you rebel against us, Marcus?
You endanger the whole community!"
"Give up your gun!"
"Come on!
Who wants to follow Lorenz Gruber?"
"My gun is my life!
Who dares to take it away from me?"
"Won't you give it up... for me, Marcus?"
"Leave him to his lawless ways, my niece."
"What he did to me is nothing... it's what he did to you!
Do you still believe he loves you?"
"He wouldn't even give you his gun!
That shows how much he cares for you."
"Ciglia, I have always loved you... but you would never listen to me..."
"I LOVE YOU!"
"I want to tell the whole world... the mountains... the sky!
I love Ciglia!"
The white blanket of winter.
"The occupation is ended... the French have gone!
We are free!"
...and never in the memory of Pontresina was there such a carnival ball so gay... so happy... so carefree...
"Ciglia!"
"Unmask!"
"Marcus... I want to go home."
"Marcus... you are out of your senses!"
"I love you... I love you madly!"
My beloved Marcus:
Let the memory of last night be wiped out of our minds.
My love is unchanged.
Ciglia.
"When Marcus comes, will you give your consent to our marriage?"
"If it means your happiness, Ciglia, I will set my doubts aside..."
"I'll tell Father Tass you want to see him."
"Don't you love me any more?"
"Uncle has consented at last!
Soon we'll be husband and wife!"
"Think, Marcus... nothing can ever threaten our happiness again!
"You are keeping something from me.
Tell me what it is... tell me!"
"I've been to Father Tass.
I've told him everything!"
"...and you've got to marry her!"
"We love each other!
How can we go through life apart?"
"This isn't a very happy marriage..."
"Serves him right!
He was always wild.
But I'm sorry for Ciglia."
"She won't grieve forever Not with Lorenz Gruber coming to see her every day."
"Do you, Marcus Paltram, promise to take this woman to be faithful to her only..."
"Give me time, Lorenz..."
"Help me, O Lord, that I may forget him!"
"... Ciglia, do you promise to love your husband until death do you part... to be faithful to him in deed... and in thought..."
"I... do."
"Does Ciglia ever think of him now?"
"I laugh for happiness!
The best and prettiest girl in all Switzerland is mine!"
"Marcus hasn't come home from the mountains!
We must gather a rescue party!"
"Marcus is lost in the mountains..."
"You can't sit here and let him die!
Do something!"
"No, I say!
I'll not lift a hand!
Let him die!"
"I thank Thee... that Thou didst save him."
"... Move away from Pontresina, Marcus.
Leave me in peace with Ciglia."
"I'll give you everything I own if you'll go..."
"I know why you wouldn't take his money!
You're still in love with that..."
"Now you die!
And I live... in peace!"
"I could kill you!
But I won't... because of Ciglia."
"...his gun was where he fell, but he disappeared I looked for him...
and couldn't find him."
"We must find him, Marcus!"
"Murderer!"
"Marcus is innocent!
I know he is!"
"She's the guilty one!
She made him do it!"
"They've gotten away!
To the mountains!"
"Leave me, Marcus...
save yourself!"
"What can we do now?"
"O Lord, Thou knowest our innocence...
Thou knowest that love is our only sin... ...have pity on us..."
"Don't separate us again!
Take us... take us together... unto Thyself..."
"Never to be parted again... together through all eternity!"

You should have let that skunk break his neck, Helius -!
I'd like to have dinner with you, Professor - can you spare some bread?
I found this in my coat when you left the other day - buy yourself some bread with it, Mr. Helius -!
Spare me having to take handouts from my only friend, Helius...

Thursday, 17 August, 1896
Hypothetical Account of the Gold Content in the Mountains of the Moon
I maintain, after many years of comparative analyses, that primitive moon-rock contains more gold than the earth's mountains.
One day, the first spaceship will fly to the moon, to bring its gold back to the earth!
Laughter, gentlemen, is the argument of idiots against every new idea -!
The progress of the world will not fail due to learned ignoramuses lacking in fantasy whose brains work in inverse proportion to their calcification -!
Professor - I've decided to go...
But not without me, Helius - not without me -!
Now your idea will triumph after all, Professor...
Naturally Windegger will go along?
What -?
Windegger won't -?
Your collaborator and best friend?
Friede Velten, student of astronomy, and Hans Windegger, Chief Engineer of Helius Hangars are engaged.
Dear Friede!
Best wishes to you and Hans!
Don't be upset that I can't come tonight to your engagement party!
Please accept the flowers as a substitute.
Yours, Wolf Helius.
He doesn't even know anything about my decision - no-one does - except for you...
I tell you, Helius, more people than you and I know of your plan -
- and the fellow whom I threw down the stairs before is one of them -!
Three nights ago -
So you think someone knows of my plans and is thus also interested in your moon-gold theory...?
Helius, don't be angry - it's my life's work - go home -
I can't rest until I know the manuscript is in your safe!
Dear Helius!
I write to you in incomparable bliss and you should be the first to know that Friede has agreed to be my wife.
Perhaps I took her a bit by surprise, but she said yes!
Come tonight to the engagement party at Friede's apartment! I am ridiculously happy!
Windegger
Fresh violets, sir?
Wolf Helius, Bergstr. 86-3 To be delivered in person
Mr. Helius isn't home...
Please... let me wait for Mr. Helius anyway.
Mr. Windegger sent me...
To be delivered in person
Accept this poor soul, if you can, and give him work and a chance to make a life - he won't disappoint you.
Warmest regards, Windegger
Drive to the nearest police station - don't hold things up with long explanations - just bring some sort of officer hereto me!
MINGO.' NICK CARTER OF THE SKY
God in Heaven; you must have some idea when you last phoned -!
Did you leave the flat unattended -?
Only for a moment, when Gustav came to get me... but then there was that man whom Mr. Windegger had sent -!
Would you allow me to use your telephone?
My phone isn't working...
Christ, madame - someone has to pick up - there's at least half a dozen people sitting around that phone -!
I'm only the foreman of Helius Hangars - but if you keep working like this, you, Miss Friede, will soon be the forewoman of us all!
I was supposed to have sent you somebody with a letter of recommendation -? !
I'm begging you, Hans, get over here...
I can't tell you over the telephone what this is all about... just, please, come...
You can be assured, Hans, that I would not call you away from your engagement party if it weren't absolutely necessary...
We'll be there right away, Helius!
Allow me to introduce myself -:
Turner...
If you go flying down those steps again, Mr. Turner, I won't be standing at the bottom to catch you...
Believe me, Mr. Helius, there's no wiser way to pass the time till the arrival of Ms. Velten and Mr. Windegger than to have a chat with me...
First, a small request... tell your chauffeur it's no longer necessary to inform the police...
The police have already been informed, Mr. Turner...
Just a measure of caution, Mr. Helius, - as well as this...
Also a measure of caution, Mr. Turner?
I now grasp the phenomenon, Mr. Turner, how you haven't been whiling away in prison all this time -!
You do flatter, Mr. Helius!
Perhaps you can also reveal to me, Mr. Turner, where the stolen manuscript - and the contents missing from my safe are located -? !
Five of the wealthiest and cleverest minds who wish to keep the earth's gold-reserve under their control -
One of the most interesting documents, madame and sirs...
To prove the accessibility of the moon,
Helius sent the unmanned trial-rocket H. 23 [ sic], filled with magnesium, moonward - the explosion of which, upon impact, was viewed and photographed from the earth!
Thanks to the competence of our representative I can show you something completely different - things that Helius himself has thus far not made available to the scientific community.
Cinematographic images of the surface of the moon by H. 32 during its first orbit of the moon.
The unmanned register-rocket H.32, equipped with automatic imaging-instruments.
The rocket-jet.
In its nose-cone... is located the egg-shaped register-chamber with the automated imaging-instruments.
The imaging-instrument, linked to a clockwork.
The mirror tele-objective.
Schematic depiction of the H.32's trajectory.
Earth... 384,00Okm...
Gravitational Field of the Earth
Gravitational Field of the Moon
Zero-G Zone
Trajectory of H.32
Necessary starting speed 11,200 metres per second
First image of the moon, 36 hours after liftoff;
Distance of the rocket from the moon: approx. 40,000 km.
The objective's eye sees what no man's eye has ever seen:
the opposite side of the moon turned away from the earth.
Cryptic, monochrome planes of colossal dimensions -
Vegetation? Fog? Water?
- all seem to confirm the theory of Prof. Peter Andreas Hansen
- of the Seeberg Observatory near Gotha - that on the opposite side of the moon exists an atmosphere and, therefore, life.
Why lose more time?
I for one want the moon's riches of gold, should they actually prove to exist, to fall into the hands of businessmen and not visionaries and idealists!
At this moment our representative is making Mr. Helius aware of our intentions in a very concrete manner...
You have only two choices, Mr. Helius:
either make the trip to the moon in our employ -
- or not at all...
If we don't come to an agreement, Mr. Helius, five minutes after my departure, your hangar, along with the nearly completed spaceship, will be reduced to a heap of rubble...
What would you gain, by killing me off, Mr. Helius?
- at the most, a travel companion who is less considerate!
You still don't get the picture, Mr. Helius... we'd rather annihilate all of your plans than let you shut us out of the operation...
Tell your clients, Mr. Turner, that I do not aim to found upon the moon a criminal-colony...
Give me 24 hours to think it over...
Will your... plans be seriously affected by the theft, Helius?
Don't worry about the plans -!
I have duplicates of everything, safe in my desk's secret compartment!
Hans dear, if I were you, I wouldn't be so sure about that!
Why did you conceal from us, Helius, the fact that you now actually want to take on the voyage to the moon?
You've called me your good comrade so often at work - in the laboratory - in this very room... now you want to lie to me, Helius?
I didn't mean to lie to you, Friede -
I just wanted to spare Hans the conflict between his love for you and his sense of duty towards the work we've been doing!
But do you really believe, Helius, that Hans would ever be capable of letting you down? !
Oh no, Helius! You won't make the trip to the moon without Windegger...
- and not without me -!
Have you forgotten, Friede, how those fared that dared this trip to the moon before us -
IN MEMORY OF...
TO THE BOLD PIONEERS OF SPACE NAVIGATION WHO DID NOT RETURN FROM THEIR JOURNEY INTO OUTER-SPACE
THEY LIVED AND DIED FOR A GREAT IDEA
HONOUR THEIR MEMORY
Friede - don't you get it?
I just couldn't stand to know you were in danger - God in heaven - and what danger indeed -!
He's decided to travel to the moon, Hans...
So when do we start -?
And who will go with us...?
Ask Friede...
Friede... you want to go with me -?
In exactly 24 hours...
Mr. Helius, the 24 hours for consideration were up 61 minutes ago...
The explosion is of no concern, Mr. Helius - it's nothing but a small accentuation of my offers...
The price of this first warning, Mr. Windegger, is the hangar;
just a shack... the second one will cost the lives of men... the third, the spaceship...
Don't force me, Mr. Helius, to take stronger measures;
choose the lesser of two evils -: me!
In this final hour I must once again warn all of you... You, Manfeldt, and you - Mr. Turner;
I'm leaving out Windegger; and as for you... Friede -!
Friede... in this last minute... - I'm begging you -
Don't beg me, Helius!
Helius, in this last instant, do you want to shame me as a woman?
The whole world's eyes are directed upon us... - the whole world's ears are listening to us...
Everyone to their stations...
We launch in 50 minutes -!
The whole world's eyes are directed upon us... - the whole world's ears are listening to us...
Just now Just now the Just now the spaceship
Just now the spaceship has reached the launch pad... because the spaceship is built too light to stand freely, it's submerged in a water-basin in which it floats upright...
From the moment of launch till attaining the necessary speed of 11,200 km per second...
SPEED
G-FORCE
after these 8 minutes, during which we'll feel an intolerable burden pulling our bodies back to earth, we'll be victors in the battle with gravitational force... or -
and if we aren't able to maintain our speed of 11200... then we'll hurtle - and hurtle - further - and further still -
- irretrievably lost in outer-space - never again... never again... to return to the earth...
I'll be the one to pull the stop-lever, Windegger...!
60 seconds to go -!
20 seconds to go - lie still - take a deep breath -!
10 seconds to go -!
NOW
Launch-rocket depleted!
Full-throttle on middle-rocket!
Win-degger... jet-tison...
middle... ro-cket...
Turn... back!
Maybe this chap is dead? !
I think Josephine needs a brandy!
I think Mr. Turner needs one even more -!
Don't you see, someone is stowed away in the cargo hold!
Okay, you wretched scoundrel, how did you get in here? !
I've devoted my whole life to moon-issues, Mr. Helius!

Turning the spaceship's black side toward the sun... to absorb warmth. -
All's well on board.

Are within 9000 km of the moon.

Watching the earth set.
We're seeing it again, Hans... we're seeing it again!
And when are we finally going to land? !
If we had a spark of reason in us, we wouldn't ever land -!
You're just afraid - you wimp -!
Tell him he has no right to jeopardise all our lives for the sake of his ambition...!
By God now is not the time for arguments, Hans -
Shut the window-hatches -!
Full brake-power - we're plummeting -!
Hold on tight -!
The ignition cable probably isn't going to fix itself!
The moon awaits...!
First though we have to do an air-sample, to tell whether we can breathe outside!
I'm only interested in how I'll get back out of here!
Do you really aim to stab Helius in the back?
Do you really aim to stab me in the back?
Now Helius has no choice but to prepare right away for the trip back -!
But Helius is convinced that we'll find water with the divining rod!
You know what the only thing is that we'll find on the moon -!
- Death!
Professor, please, help me with the air-sample!
For God's sake, don't open it -!
If he opens the outer door and outside there's no breathable atmosphere, then we're done for good!
He's taken the divining rod with him!
It's as if the rod is pulling him forward!
Mingo would follow this trail, Mr. Helius!
The main objective should be to look for water!
I have enough to do, to get us ready to launch again!
May I volunteer to look for Professor Manfeldt and, at the same time, water?
Atmosfere breathable, not yet analised.
Törner on the trale for 3 hours of Manfeldt searching for water.
Since when is Gustav your secretary?
I can't stand it anymore...
I'm going to look for Manfeldt -!
From Miss Friede...
so you won't go hungry!
Professor -!
Manfeldt -!
Don't let him into the ship! Don't let him into the ship!
Is there anyone in the world to whom we should relay your last regards - if we get back to earth?
The oxygen containers - the shot hit the oxygen containers -!
What does this mean, Miss Friede, with the oxygen containers? !
Let's pray to God it means nothing!
We've lost more than half of the oxygen!
That means: one of us can't go back to earth -!
One of us has to stay on the moon -!
Yes, Windegger:
one of us!
Do you know what this means - do you? !
To stay here - alone on the moon - just because you didn't want to listen to me - YOU and him!
Short one loses - long one wins... and we draw three times...
how's that? !
You draw -!
So draw then -!
Would it be easier for you, Hans, if I stayed with you on the moon?
I have only one desire:
to get back to earth -!
Let's drink to a happy homecoming to earth - for all of us... to a happy homecoming - for all of us, Hans!
The base-camp is ready, Mr. Helius!
Now you must prove, Gustav, that I can rely upon you!
I'm staying back here on the moon...
- and you will guide the spaceship away from the moon!
Do you want Mr. Windegger to perish -?
And Miss Friede, who loves him -?
The enormous shock of the launch will naturally wake the sleepers - and then Mr. Windegger will take over the command...
I am convinced that you won't let me down just as I haven't let you down.
I shall wait calmly and with confidence that you'll come to get me.
-Helius.
Farewell!
Mammy, we're almost through with the picking.
Yes, sir! And we done put in a good season's work.
- Zeke.
You got all of them things that you got to buy in town tomorrow?
Yes, Mammy, I've got them right here.
Here it is, Mammy.
Why, here's a nice shirt for Pappy... and a pair of pants for Spunk.
You knows you just joking.
Why, I never had no new pants in my life.
Why, as soon as you goes out 'em, I stepped in.
- And a dress for Missy Rose...
- Oh, Zeke, what kind?
It ain't gonna be no wedding dress and you needn't be... asking me for none neither.
Ain't nobody asked you for no wedding dress.
- Who'd marry you? - Why, you would.
What does you think Mammy adopted you for... except so you could marry me?
- She didn't do nothing, did you Mammy?
- Course she did.
Oh, children, don't you all fuss.
Zeke, what you gonna bring the children?
I don't see nothing on here for Sears.
Nor Roebuck.
Gee whiz!
Nor Coe.
Did you done forgot?
Oh, don't tease them, Zeke.
Don't I see a new bright pocket knife hanging on that string?
And a whole lot of marbles.
And a big pack of chewing gum.
Yes.
I believe you sure is right, Mammy.
But what you want me to bring you from town, Mammy?
You's always leaving yourself out.
- Don't matter about me, son.
- Yes'm, it do.
Well, looky here.
Here's a straw hat with a whole lot of feathers on it for you, Mammy.
And a pair of them shiny gold spectacles.
Don't bring me nothing, son.
Mammy, I can't buy nothing.
I got to buy you something.
Why, there ain't no "nothing" to buy.
Well, all right then. Anything you choose.
Oh, cotton
Hey, cotton
Cotton
"...have no other God before me.
"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness...
"of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath...
"or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shall not bow..."
- Hello, folks.
Come on, Henry. We got a great big dish of chitlins just waiting for you.
Everybody loves chitlins.
Henry, I sure am glad to see you.
Sit right down and make yourself at home.
Every time I see you, you got that old banjo with you.
- What's the matter with...
- Better put that old starvation box down... you gonna have a lot of trouble, some of these days.
What you talking about, man? This banjo is my best friend.
- How come it is?
Why sure, you know what I did?
Just here, last week, I told this old banjo:
"Banjo, I'm tired of telling time by the old sun."
I said, "I wants me a watch."
Well, what did it do?
- Here it is.
- Let me see it.
Look at that, Pappy.
- That sure is a good watch.
- Look at that baby!
You sure is lucky to get a watch like that.
Mammy, it's alive.
I hear its heart beating.
You're just lucky. I don't believe you stole it.
- Fine watch.
- Don't you know, this thing's ticking.
- Sure, it's going to tick.
- Let me look at it, then.
What time is by your watch, Henry?
There it is.
Sure is.
Henry, if you ain't gonna eat none of these chitlins... we gonna clear away the table.
- We sure is.
- Come on, boys.
Let's have a little dance. - I'm gonna do good.
Hello, Adam and Eve.
What are you doing around here?
Well, we just come down to see if you had time to marry us.
- To marry you?
Ain't these eleven children yours?
That's right. And we thought it was about time... for us to make it more permanent.
Seems like you made it mighty late getting round here to be married.
- The damage is all done.
But could you fix us up, anyhow?
Well, it's never too late to do the will of the Lord.
That's right. That's right.
Well, children, I certainly is glad to see you all done make up your minds... to do the right thing.
Thank you. 'Cause you know, I've always been a respectable woman... and I don't want that to come up against my character.
Oh, it ain't what you was. It's what you is today.
Look here, you ain't got on no wedding veil. I ain't gonna marry you in no wedding veil.
- Now, Missy, go get the veil.
I guess we'll conduct this marriage ceremony right around there... under that tree. Just follow me round here.
The Lord is with us to see this wedding.
- Look like you're gonna have your way.
- That's right.
Venus, come and be your Pappy's best man.
You look more like your mammy... every day.
...in the time of man's innocence... signifying unto us the mystical union... that is between Christ and his church.
- Which holy estate Christ adorned...
- Hello, Zeke.
Come on, kiss me, Missy Rose.
...and first miracle that he wrought in Cana of Galilee.
What's the matter with your eyes?
- Don't look at me like that.
- I been looking at you all day.
You sure do look good tonight, Missy Rose.
Oh, Zeke, don't do that.
- Come on, kiss me.
- Don't do that, Zeke.
- Come on, kiss me.
Oh, Zeke.
...or lightly, but reverently.
- Man and wife.
The wedding's all over.
They're married. Come on out and kiss the bride.
Excuse me, Missy Rose, but it looks like the devil's in me here tonight.
That's all right, Zeke. I'll forgive you.
Go ahead, my son.
- Ready, Henry?
Sweet little baby
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake I pray the Lord, my soul to take.
Bless Mammy and Pappy.
Bless Missy Rose, Brother Zeke and Spunk.
Bless Sears, Roebuck and Coe. Amen.
Hush you bye
Don't you cry
Little baby
You shall have
All the horses in the pasture
They belong to Mammy's little baby
Go to sleep
Now, get up there.
Here, here, here.
Go along. Go to bed. You're old enough to go to bed by yourself.
- Goodnight, Mammy.
- Goodnight, Mammy.
- Goodnight, Spunk.
- Goodnight, Pappy.
- Goodnight, Missy.
- Goodnight, Zeke.
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Lord, grant me.
- Goodnight, Zeke. - Goodnight.
These mules are so stubborn.
Stop right here.
- Whoa there, mule.
- Take it down to Veteran Smith.
Let us give thanks for our success this year.
Let us kneel right down here.
We is most grateful for this bountiful crop, O Lord...
- Yes, sir.
...and we trust you won't be offended...
...if we just ask one favor more.
Please, Lord, let us get a good price...
- for our cotton.
- Do pray, Lord.
- Don't forget the flour and the pepper.
- Buy me my chewing gum.
- Don't forget my bowie knife.
My buddy and my buddy's friend Can pick more cotton than the gin can gin
Come on there, mule, giddap!
Whoa, there.
Come on here, Spunk. Let's hurry up and get this cotton ginned... so we can get on downtown there before everything's closed up.
It'll be over in two shakes of a lamb's tail.
Well, if you'd just shake your tail a little bit...
- it'd be so much better.
- Come on and help me.
- I is. I done all the work, anyhow.
- What do you know?
- I'm listening.
Sure sounds pretty, don't it?
Sure is.
You know that song.
- But I ain't sung that in a long time.
- Sounds like At the End of the Road.
The way is long
But I don't mind 'cause a happy lark
Will be singing
At the end of the road
I can't go wrong, I must go right
I'll find my way 'cause the guiding light
Will be shining
There may be thorns in my path
But I'll wear a smile
'Cause in a little while
My path will be roses
The rain may fall from up above
But I won't stop 'cause the ones I love
Will be waiting
The way is long, the night is dark
I'll find my way 'cause a guiding light
I seem to roam through a field
That is snowy white
And through the silent night
A banjo is strumming
It says, "Come back, I roam no more"
My mammy's heart and the cabin door
Will be open
- We sure needs you around here, Zeke.
- Hello there, fellas. How is everything?
You sure can sing good, fellas.
I feel much better. I can work harder.
Yes, indeed. I'm going to get this cotton on down in this gin here.
Come on here, boy. Let's get through.
Yes. Here I is, fellas.
Let her come on down here.
Take it on down here.
- Look out, down there.
Going down to New Orleans
- Going to leave my honey downriver
- Roll down from night till day
- Well, I'm sure going away forever
- Going down to New Orleans
Roll the cotton, roll the cotton
Roll the cotton from early morn
Roll this baby sure as you're born
Roll the cotton, roll the cotton
Roll the cotton, roll the cotton Roll this baby sure as you're born
I sure is going to eat myself... plenty of corn bread and chitlins here tonight.
Do it, Cy.
Do it for your papa.
What did he get?
- Lord save us, look at that gal.
- Did you see those eyes?
Yes, sir!
Some chicken.
What a brown-skinned bunch of sweetness she is.
Three steps to Heaven. Angels walking on earth.
Boy, she's chocolate to the bone.
Boy, shake that starboard hip.
Open that door and let me in here.
Boy, she knows her stuff.
That baby's got a wiggle even worms can't realize.
- No fooling, that gal sure knows her...
- Get back here, boy.
- Here, here, here.
You is just what I has got on my mind.
Let's get on away from here.
Say, get out of the way, small change.
You don't look like no big money to me.
I don't, doesn't I?
Well, just let your eyes feast upon this.
Guy got a roll that would choke an elephant.
No, no, it ain't nothing like that.
This here money is mine, and here it is where it remains.
Say, where did you get all the money, big boy?
Cotton, cotton
Always picking cotton
Don't matter where I gets my money, I has it just the same.
Where is you going, honey?
Anywhere you going, big boy.
Sure enough?
- Well, let's go away from here.
- I want to look good...
Come on away from here, honey.
Hello there, gal, how you feeling?
Let's have it, tin can.
- That's it, girl.
- Get out there, will you, honey.
The Benevolent Orders of the Flat-Footed Waiters
Gave their annual ball
With the price of admission only one half-a-dollar
They just crowded the hall
Flat-footing around
They suddenly found
An original movement that they call the Swanee Shuffle
It's for you and for all
Now learn to do the Swanee Shuffle
Nothing to the Swanee Shuffle
Against the beat, you make your feet
Swanee Shuffle along
If they're flat just make them flatter
Like a pancake on a platter
I'm telling you, it's easy to
Now just imitate the way a waiter
Walks with a plate of chow
Why, you needn't wait to do it later
Why not now?
I'll show you how
Come with me where Dixie marches
Marches on its fallen arches
And see them Swanee Shuffle along
Learn to do the Swanee Shuffle
Nothing to the Swanee Shuffle
Now if they're flat just make them flatter
I'm telling you, it's easy to
And see them Swanee Shuffle along
There it is now. There it is now.
Oh, shuffle it, boy.
Move it, baby.
Now that boy's sweet as honey.
All right, nice.
Everybody dance!
Oh, play that thing.
How you feel, big boy?
Like my dancing?
Does I?
Honey, I likes anything you's got.
My great, big, dancing, teasing, trancing man.
How much money is you got, big boy?
Well, I's got to close on 'round... About $100.
You ain't got $200, is you, honey?
No, I ain't got no $200.
$100 suits me all right, right now.
But wouldn't it be nice if you had $200... so you and me could spend $100... and then you could take that other $100 home where it belongs?
Well, where's I gonna get any $200?
Why, it took my family six months' hard work to get half that much.
But with financing, there ain't nothing you can't get.
Where did he get all that luck from?
- Just dancing with you, honey?
- Now who's been talking to you?
I's just overflowing with luck.
Dancing with me is like having a rabbit foot in each pocket.
Then I ought to be about the luckiest man in the world, right now.
I ought to have been here a long time ago.
Why, what do you know about that?
- Why, if that ain't the old boy himself.
Well, there's Hot Shot now, honey.
Say listen, he's got more money than he knows what to do with. And is one of the most generous suckers I ever heard tell of.
- Is that true, sure enough?
- I mean it.
Let's go on to him and ask. Right now.
Come on, let's go see what he got.
Atta boy.
Hey, Hot Shot, look here.
Who called Hot Shot?
Come here a minute, will you?
What's on your mind, high yellow? What's aching you now?
Here's a boy who says he feels kind of lucky.
And he wants to know if you gonna give him a little accommodation.
Say, come on now and help the boy out a little.
You know anything about shooting dice, son?
Well, I just knows the words. I ain't so familiar with the tune.
You old sweet rascal, you.
- You sure can say some cute things.
- Sure enough?
I ain't wasting no time on no buck-and-a-half cotton picker.
Say, what's the matter with you, goofy head.
This boy ain't one of those kind, is you, big boy?
Say, what does he mean, buck-and-a-half cotton picker?
I bet I got more money in my pocket right now...
- than he ever thought of having.
- Sure you have.
Say, honey, wouldn't it be nice if you'd spent a $100... all on your baby? By this time tomorrow...
Yeah, what is the matter with that tinhorn?
Come on over here, let me show him something.
What do you mean, "buck-and-a-half cotton picker"?
Suppose I paid you $20 right off the bat?
That makes a lot of difference.
Money talks with me brother, money talks.
That's just what I said, money talks.
Go ahead, he wins the first throw.
Deuce... - and a six. - Atta, baby!
Stand close to me, honey.
Keep on feeding me luck, yeah?
Let's hit old stiff hat for a natural right now.
That'll be good.
How do you like that?
Well, I'll give you a break, big boy.
Go ahead, shoot that 40.
Go ahead and shoot the 40.
You... He can't win no more.
Come on, now, money can't grow down there in the hand.
Put it down. Atta boy!
Don't fail me this time, dice.
- Roll right out on a natural.
- Here it is again.
Now you knows I can't keep this up all night long, brother.
You sure can't.
Bound to crap out some of these times.
Shoot that $80.
Let the $80 ride.
Come on. If you win, you'll have a $160.
And we'll be sitting pretty.
She's telling you right, boy.
- Come on, put your money out there.
- Let's go. Can't wait all night.
Well, this is the time we hit him.
Honey, stick close to me now, sure enough.
Yeah, and this is the time that old boy craps.
Let it be snake eyes.
Let me be right, dice, let me be right.
Keep the big boy broke.
This is my last chance.
Natural, dice, natural.
Right in the dough.
In the dough is right.
That is a six and an ace.
This is the best gravy train ever rolled up my alley.
Pretty good day.
He's took all my money.
I didn't know. I thought you'd win.
Oh, I'll help you to get some more money.
Oh, don't act like this.
Let me see them dice.
You ain't suspecting me, is you, big boy.
There ain't nothing wrong with them dice.
Go on, let him see the dice, Hot Shot.
Well, I ain't saying nothing, but let me see them dice.
Come on, why don't you let him see them?
That ain't nothing.
There they is.
There ain't nothing wrong with them dice.
There ain't nothing wrong with the dice, big boy.
I don't see nothing wrong.
Let me see that pair of dice you just playing with.
Oh, you're starting that bellyaching, huh?
Starting that racket.
Come on, let him see the dice, if you got any more in your pocket.
Let me see that pair of dice you got in your pocket.
Say, you better keep quiet.
You big country hick.
Say, don't call him no country hick. He ain't no country hick.
You'll be getting my back up in a minute.
Why don't you stop all this?
Going around here squawking about losing your dough like a big 10-year-old.
Say, don't take it so hard, big boy.
There's lots more cotton in the field.
Let me alone.
I'm asking you once more.
Let me see them dice you got in your pocket.
Now, I'm getting pretty tired of you trying to bullyrag me.
Now you get your hide out of here before I throws it out.
Go on out, big boy. I'll be out in a minute. Go on.
Now, you clear out of here before I let you have some of this.
Give 'em room, give 'em room.
Come on, get a move on.
There's the door.
Come back here and give me my money back, you dirty thieves.
You dirty skunks.
Spunk.
You ain't hurt, is you?
I'm hurt, right here.
You're all right, ain't you?
Speak to me, Spunk.
Oh, God!
- Where is you hurt, Spunk?
- Right here...
Zeke, did they get the money from the cotton seed?
I'm so glad I found you, big brother.
Can't you...
Can't you do something for me?
These bullets...
These bullets hurt me so.
- Wait a minute...
- Oh, Lord, help me.
...and I'll see if I can get somebody to help me.
Oh, help me, somebody.
Come here and help me. My brother is dying.
Oh, God, won't somebody help me?
Help me, please. Help me, please.
Spunk.
I'll take you home to Mammy.
She'll help me.
Can you stand up, Spunk?
Can you try to help and get up?
Come on. Come across you.
You're holding out on me, eh?
You keep quiet.
You only get half of what I won.
Didn't I have $40 when I started?
Oh, you ain't never had $40 in your life.
Oh, Lord... have mercy on my children.
Have mercy on my soul.
- Haven't they been here, Mammy?
- Mammy, didn't the boys...
Didn't the boys come home yet?
Mama, what's the matter?
Children ain't come home yet.
Have mercy upon my children.
Mammy, don't cry.
Have mercy on my soul.
Don't cry, Mammy, they coming home.
Mammy, don't cry.
The Lord will bring them home safe.
The Lord will bring them home, Mammy.
- Oh, our poor boys.
- Don't cry, Mammy.
We wonder this morning where they are.
Send them to us, sweet Jesus.
Yes, Lord. Lord have mercy upon them.
Let our boys come.
Have mercy upon our brothers.
Where can our boys be this morning?
Lord, have mercy upon them.
Can they be on their way here?
What's that I hear?
Where is our boy Spunk?
Where is Spunk?
Oh, our poor boy.
Oh, Lord, have mercy upon us. Oh, Lord.
Lord, have mercy upon us this morning.
Lord, have mercy...
Oh, graveyard
You must give us his body now
Weep not
Weep not, dear Mother
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
Weep not, Father
Come, son.
I am not here to judge you.
Oh, Pappy, I've sinned.
I've sinned... and I am hanging on the edge of hell.
But the Lord forgives.
My heart is aching for my poor brother.
Oh, my heart is aching.
Oh, Pappy, show me how to repent.
Show me the way.
Look, son... the Lord has sent an angel... to show you the way.
Can't you see him coming... in that snow-white chariot... and snow-white robe?
Can't you hear him, son?
It is the angel of the Lord... that comforts... them that mourn.
Look, son... can't you see him?
Yes, Pappy.
I see him and I hear him.
The Lord's done showed me the light.
The Lord has done revealed the truth of his creation.
I lay my brother... down in the ground... but the ground can't hold my brother.
No, Pappy.
The ground can't hold him.
'Cause the Lord is stronger than the ground.
Why, the Lord is the ground.
The Lord is the sky... and the heavens and the moon and the sun.
The Lord is the earth... and all the living things of the earth.
The Lord in his kingdom.
Ain't no more pain.
There ain't no more sorrow.
And there ain't no more death.
So why do we wail in grief?
Oh, my brother...
I gives you back to the sky and the wind... and to the earth and to the seas.
I gives you back to the Lord.
For the Lord is the beginning... as well as the end.
Come with your sorrow... and leave with his joy.
Come with your failure... and leave with his victory.
Come, oh come with your emptiness... and leave with the fullness of his joy.
Come, oh, come to the Lord.
Come to that land of green pastures.
Come to the Lord.
Out in the night.
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home
Get on board, little children
There's room for many a-more
Brethren and sisters... the servant of the Lord is here, to give you all... a free airplane ride direct to glory. Let's go! Amen.
All right, you fellas.
- Give me a dunking down.
- Get on behind him.
- All right, just lead him. I'll kick him out.
- Get down!
I'm glad to shake your hand.
Yes, sir. Come down to the meeting tonight.
Giddap!
I've had me a good time today, really!
Hot mama, raring to go. Where you going, buttercup?
I is going where I's going, that's where I's going!
You move out the way.
Everywhere I go, you come following along behind me.
- Oh, now...
- Oh, move out the way!
Brother Zekiel's coming!
Great day, the righteous marching Great day
God's going to build up Zion's walls Great day
God's going to build up Zion's walls
This is the day of jubilee
God's going to set his...
Be still!
Look at that little mule!
What kind of mule is that?
Hey, Chick... ain't that, that guy we cleaned out down in Greenville?
What you know about that?
It sure am.
Well, well, well!
So that's who this guy is, eh?
That's that guy.
Can you beat that!
Hey, let's have some fun with this guy here. Come on.
Hey there, Brother! How's the dice rolling these days?
A big fella like you ought to be carrying that little donkey instead of riding it!
- Hey, did you get that look?
You've kind of turned up your nose at us sinners, nowadays, huh?
Shut up, you yellow hussy.
You ain't never going to be nothing at all.
All you want is to come here and get after my boy!
Go on back down there to that alley where you belong.
Oh, well, it's just another one of the Lord's little mistakes!
The Lord don't make no mistakes, you understand?
You can make a fool of Zekiel... but you can't make fun of the Lord, while Zekiel is around...
- and I'm gonna make you respect him.
- Are you gonna stand for that?
Why don't you knock him down?
I'll knock your brains out, you big lug.
What you mean, anyway?
And you can't make fun of the Lord neither, while I'm around!
- I ain't none of them things.
I'm the servant of the Lord, and I've got the strength of the Lord in my arms.
In these two arms!
It's too bad that he's got to put his holy hands on you. You'll spoil them!
The Lord will surely punish them for that.
I wish I was about 10 years older. I'd show you something!
You got some nerve, coming down here!
God's going to build up...
Give me that old-time religion
And it's good enough for me
It was good for the Hebrew children
Old-time religion
Look at that boy sitting up there with his whole family around him!
I bet you ten-to-one you can't save me, Brother Zekiel.
Make me cry.
You're making everybody else cry around here!
- Say, boy, look...
- What's the matter with you, gal?
- You crazy?
- Dry it up, small change!
Brethren and sisters... the text of my sermon is going to be:
"Repent, ye sinners...
"before it is too late."
- Oh yeah!
The road to hell is downhill.
Downhill!
Easy and greased like lightning.
And the Cannonball Express... is leaving for hell twice a day.
Yeah!
I'm talking to all you sinners out there, who's on that train.
I'm going along with you... and I'm gonna give all you sinners your last chance.
But remember... there ain't no round trip ticket to hell!
Brothers and sisters... we's gonna make three stops before we get to hell... and we're approaching the first one now.
The first stop, is the town of Faith.
Town of Faith!
It's just a little place, but the climate is cool... and the people is friendly and kind.
Some of you bootleggers... and some of you gamblers... better get off and take hold of Faith!
Brothers, come right along!
Preach it right and long!
Children, come on and get off at Faith!
That's right, children.
Don't you make no mistake in locating in Faith.
We're going on to the next station.
Hear that old train pulling out?
Pulling out!
Children, you see that old devil throw that cinder in my eye?
Dirty devil!
He's just trying to make me miss that next stop... but I'll surely fool him.
I'll surely fool him.
We is coming to the next station.
- Obedience.
- Obedience!
Oh, but Obedience.
Here, sister. Don't leave your man behind.
Make him get off at Obedience.
I'll get him!
Come on, sister. Bring your man on and make him get off at Obedience.
- Obedience...
...is a nine o'clock town.
- Surely, it is.
And the curfew rings every night.
- Sure it does.
- Sure do!
Bring up your children in obedience, and you'll know... they'll grow up good Christians... and not just little old scalawags!
Children should be seen and not heard.
All you sinners.
Come on and jump aboard, you sinners.
This side is for the leading citizens in Obedience.
Get out here.
We's going on to the last station.
Watch it go.
Can't get enough steam now.
The last station.
We's coming to that last station, the last station:
Repentance... is the last station before hell.
Anybody here want to get off at Repentance?
Oh, yeah!
That's right, children.
Come on, kneel on down.
It gets kind of hot in Repentance sometimes... but never as hot as hell.
Won't you come, sister?
Won't you come?
I beg with you.
I plead with you.
Don't bother me. Leave me alone.
I don't want to hear nothing you got to say.
Come on and repent... repent, I say.
I'm speaking to that last sinner and I don't want her to go to hell.
Won't you come? Won't you come?
You hear that old devil say
Come on down below
But you just let him know
You're heading for Heaven
Come on and climb the golden stairs
And all your troubles and all your cares
Will be over at the end of the road
Won't you come, sister?
I'm pleading with you.
I want to go, Brother Zekiel.
I want to be saved.
I want to be good.
I'm coming, Brother Zekiel.
I'm sticking with the last sinner... and I don't want her to go to hell!
'Cause the guiding light will be shining
Carry me to the water
Oh, carry me to the water
To be baptized
Stand right around, brother.
Fold your arms.
I have another building Not made by hand, I know
I know I have another building A building not made by hand
I know I have another building Not made by hand, I know
Praise the Lord! Praise the name!
Oh, Lord, make me good.
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord, make me pure.
Oh, brother!
Praise his holy name.
I've been a wicked woman. I've been a wicked woman.
- But I'm sanctified now.
- I know how it is.
Hold me close to you, Brother Zekiel. Keep me good.
Keep me good.
Don't let me sin no more.
Pray, Brother Zekiel.
You're so good.
Leave her here with me.
You go on there back to your people.
Have mercy on me!
Here, what's the matter with you, gal?
Ain't nothing.
Yes, you got more religion than what's good for you... you hypocrite!
Come on up here, Christmas!
You're slower than cold molasses in the winter time.
Come on up here.
Tuck your heads there, boys.
Even so, we've been mighty lucky.
That's the first she-devil we run across since we've started on this trip.
She sure is pretty, Mammy.
I never see such big eyes in all my life.
Oh, big eyes!
Why, Zeke ain't had no mind for no big eyes. Not since his brother died, anything but them.
We got trouble here, trouble there
I really don't believe We got trouble everywhere
We got trouble everywhere we go
He's coming now, Mammy.
I'm gonna change my apron.
... trouble there
I really does believe We got trouble everywhere
Tired, son?
I'll let you have a nice plate of this hot chitlins.
I sure would, Mammy.
But I likes everything you cook.
I know you certainly is crazy about chitlins.
What's the matter, son?
I was just thinking, Mammy.
I don't know what I would do... if I didn't have you and Missy Rose to look after me.
It does take a good woman for to keep a man out of mischief these days.
That's right, Mammy. It sure does.
Now, don't go fretting, son.
Your Pappy and me is the best friends you got.
And we gonna look after you just as long as we can.
Thank you, Mammy.
Because you're the same old Zeke to me.
- Missy Rose!
Come on here and look after these vittles on the stove... while I get ready to go to the jubilee.
Missy Rose, come over here and sit down with me, won't you?
Why, what's the matter, Brother Zeke?
That's just it, I don't know what is the matter.
Seems like the devil's done took ahold of me.
What you mean? What kind of talk is that?
A big strong man like you ain't going to give in to that nasty devil...
- after we done traveled this far.
- I don't want to give in... but he just keeps on a-clawing and a-pulling after me all the time.
- That's just the way he do.
- Just won't let me be.
What's we going to do, big brother?
I don't know what we're going to do.
- Unless what, Zeke?
Missy Rose, supposing you and me...
Let's you and me get married, at the next station.
That'll stop him quicker than anything.
Brother Zeke.
You know, I love you.
Mammy, where is my pipe?
What you hide my pipe for, anyway?
Why can't you let things be?
I suspect it's up somewhere where you just left it.
Oh, here it is, you old stew pot.
Mammy, Pappy, Missy Rose and me's got a surprise for you.
- Yeah? - Yes.
Ain't we, honey?
We is done decided to get married at the next station.
- Pappy, ain't that happy news?
- I long expected that.
- Yes, and I'm glad.
- They had to come to it.
Let me kiss both of you.
God bless you all. Well, well, well.
Children, that's just as it ought to be.
Zeke and Missy.
Looky here, children. You know the Lord's going to set his blessing on this wedding.
Well, well, well, this is justice for you.
Pappy and I done waited a long time for this day.
Here, honey, this ain't no time for no crying.
Why, don't you know that me and you is going to make... that old devil run so fast... that his horns and his tail's gonna drop off?
Don't cry no more, now. Please don't cry, honey.
- No, this ain't no time to cry.
- Yeah, Mammy, you talk to her.
Yes, she ain't nothing at all but a child.
Well, appears it's better for you to cry first and then laugh last.
I'm crying because I'm happy, Mammy.
Yes, well these men, they ain't no angels. There ain't none of them no angels.
But I tell you, you wouldn't find a better boy than my Zeke... if you was to scratch this world with a fine tooth comb.
Give me that old-time religion
It is good enough for me
It was good for the Hebrew children
And it's good enough for me
What are you doing here, Hot Shot? What are you doing here?
So you're all hopped up about that fake preacher, huh?
Go on, Hot Shot, leave me be.
I ain't got no time for you now.
Come on, you ain't got no time for me now, huh?
I been wrong all these years, understand?
I found happiness.
Brother Zekiel has given me strength and shown me the way.
Well, of all the people in this world to fall for that kind of 'lasses.
- Come on, babe, give me a kiss.
- Get out of my way, Hot Shot.
I got religion now.
Oh, I don't care nothing about your religion.
Take your hands off of me, Hot Shot!
How come you don't want my hands on you no more?
I'll make you forget that psalm-singing, crap-shooting faker.
- He ain't none of them things.
- Yes, he is.
And I is late for the services... and you or nobody else ain't going to keep me... from the protecting arms of Brother Zekiel.
- You ain't going out that door.
Can't you see that my blood is washed in the spirit of the Lamb?
I can see that your blood's been washed in the fire of the devil.
Can't you see that I'm through sinning, Hot Shot? Oh, please.
Oh, you ain't never gonna quit sinning, gal.
It's right there in your blood.
Oh, Lord, give me strength!
Oh, help me, Brothel Zekiel!
I'll break your neck.
Get off of me. I'll show you.
Don't use that poker, gal.
Don't come around no more.
- You dirty skunk!
That's what I'm doing to anybody that stands in my path to glory.
Come on, old Devil.
Put up your hands before I bust you in the jaw.
- Hit him, Brother Zekiel! - Don't be backing around in that corner... like you're scared of me.
I is with you, Brother Zekiel.
This bell ain't going to ring until you been down and out.
Preach it, Brother Zeke.
- You got me that time.
- We're proud of you, Brother.
Yes, go ahead and laugh. Laugh.
This going to be your last time... because you're going to finish your laugh in hell.
Hell, Brother Zekiel, hell!
I'm tired of you making sinners out of my people.
Now, come on get up from there.
Pick up your bones...
- because the fight ain't over yet.
Now, brothers, he's trying to give me a battle.
- That's for the gamblers you done made.
- That's for the backbiters.
- Preach it.
- And that's for the midnight ramblers.
- Tell it so they can hear it. Tell it, yes.
And that's for the corn-whiskey drinkers, the jazz dancers... the scandal-mongers and the bootleggers.
There he is, the old devil is down and out.
Somebody come here and get a stretcher and take him away from here.
Put him on that train to hell, and let him... ride, let him ride on down by himself.
- Oh, brothers, we done been sanctified.
- Sanctified!
We done been purified.
We done been saved... and we don't belong to him no more.
I belong to that band
This is Missy calling you!
Oh, Lordy! Come back!
Please don't leave me, Brother Zeke!
This is Missy calling you!
Oh, Zeke, where is you?
Please don't go.
Come back! Don't leave!
Oh, Lordy!
Brother Zeke! Where are you?
- Zeke's gone.
- Zeke is gone?
Knocking off, now. Come on, boys, let's go.
Come on here, Jim.
Gee, Babe! I sure had a hard time finding you.
And another thing, I ain't going to leave you until you goes with me.
Give me some of that good old loving you got there. Come on.
Holy mackerel!
The man is coming from the mill.
Give me my hat, woman.
I hate to see
That evening sun go down
My man's done quit me
And done left this town
Feeling tomorrow
Just like I feel today
I'm gonna pack my trunk
And make my getaway
Easy rider
He done lost his rein
With gin and gambling
They're gonna hide your face
To work for that woman
Say, what's the matter with you, long face?
Don't you like my singing?
What's that buggy doing out there?
Buggy?
Why, honey, I ain't seen no buggy.
I don't know nothing about no buggy.
Well, there was one out there when I come in.
Oh, don't be suspicious.
Come on and show your baby.
My goodness, you just as fussy as you can be.
Now come on out there and show me where the buggy is.
Don't be like that.
Now see that, baby?
I told you there wasn't no buggy out there.
Come on and eat your dinner.
Don't be like that.
Come on now and be good.
Come on now and sit down.
What's the matter, you sick?
- Well, what's the matter then?
Has the boss been at you again today, huh?
No. I told you no.
Don't bother me.
Tell me, honey, what's on your mind?
Here I've been waiting for you all day... to come home and put your big strong arms around me... and now you treat me just like I'm a stepchild.
- Is you treating me right, Chick?
- Course I is.
Let your baby sit on your lap and make you... feel so good.
That's it, dreaming boy.
Rest your head on Chick.
I sure is tired, Chick.
I'm tired of thinking.
I know you is.
Stop thinking.
Thinking makes you say bad words to Chick.
Zeke, you asleep?
- Come on, Chick!
He's following us.
- Oh, I can't run!
- Hurry up.
He's got a gun! - No, I can't run.
Hold tight, Chick.
Hold tight, Chick.
Look out the wheel's going.
Thought you was going to get away from me, didn't you?
Don't you know you can't quit me like that?
Before I let you get away from me, I'll break you in two.
I is broke in two already, Zeke.
Please take me out of this mud.
Don't talk to me like that. Oh, please.
Won't you please take me out?
I ain't two-timing you, Zeke.
- That's what you been doing all the time.
- I never knowed what I wanted.
Don't be sore with me.
That old devil's coming closer now... and I is getting more scared all the time.
That old devil's reaching out his claws for me.
Can't you help your Chick now?
Your Chick's done gone to the devil.
No, honey.
You can't go! You can't go!
Zekiel, don't let that old devil get me.
Old devil can't get you, honey.
Not as long as I'm around.
Hold me, Brother Zekiel. Hold me in your strong arms.
I'm holding you, honey.
I'm holding you, baby.
Holding you in my heart, forever.
I is scared, Brother Zekiel.
I is scared to meet the Lord... so scared.
Who done this? Who done this?
I know. I know!
She hurt?
The wheel...
What's the matter with this thing?
Whoa there, boy.
Don't kill me, don't...
This old hammer kill John Henry
But it won't kill me
No it won't kill me
There ain't no hammer
On this mountaintop
That rings like mine
Going home
I'm a going home
Quiet like
Some still day
I'm just going home
It's not far
Just close by
Through an open door
Work all done
Care laid by
Time to fear no more
Mother's there
Expecting me
Father's waiting, too
Lots of folks
Gathered there
All the friends I knew
Mammy.
I'm so glad you come, my son.
- Where do you come from, Zeke?
- Brother, you gone and left us.
Brother Zeke, where do you come from?
We're glad to see you back.
You don't look well, Brother Zeke.
Pappy, can I come into your house?
Boy, you're just in time to help us with the picking.
Missy Rose, you ain't forgotten me, is you?
I love you too much.
Do you, sure enough, honey?
Son, you must be mighty hungry.
Don't you want some chitlins and spare ribs?
- Mammy, I likes anything you cook.

KOVRIGUINE and RAKHALS
Not ten, not twenty, not really one hundred, one hundred MILLIONS of illiterate people, of retarded people, of peasants,
of retarded farmers that have been left in heritage by the old system!
The precariousness.
The extreme poverty.
Still nowadays...
When two brothers split apart
we share the farm in two.
Sharing means
that the land is divided.
We proceed to the sharing.
That's the way the farms grow poorer and collapse.
One amongst others.
Marfa Lapkina.
Inventory:
Horses: None
Cows: One
Plow: None
Swing plow: 1 Harrow: None
And outside
it's springtime.
The farmer's springtime.
Without a horse, a disaster.
We have to ask for one.
We are not giving him.
Summer...
And no horse!
No horse!
In despair...
There's no way!
There's no way living like that.
There's no way living like that!
We can't live only for ourselves.
We have to unite our forces.
The Party committee decides to support
the proposition of Lapkina about the creation of a dairy cooperative...
Our taxes are not enough?
Now you want our last cows!
Another trick from the Soviets!
The local agronomist
Comrades peasants!
A dairy cooperative would be a great help for you.
Who's for it?
I declare the dairy cooperative officially started!
Dairy cooperative "The October Way"
The drought.
A cloud is passing by chance.
Deception?
With the first loan
A SEPARATOR
that will allow
to make butter.
Deception or advance?
DECEPTION?
ADVANCE?
It's going to condense!
NO?
It has condensed!
CONDENSED!
And the number of cooperative members increased.
And the dairy cooperative worked...
With the first profit!
Don't even think of distributing the money of the cooperative!
But it's going to be lost money!
Give back this money!
What will you do with it?
Just drinking!
What about the pedigree bull?
How are we going to set up the bovine cooperative?
I'm going to watch over the money, and we will have that bull!
You think it's a dream?
It's a sovkhoz, A state farm!
Fomka
And so, the dairy cooperative evolved in a bovine cooperative.
From a temple of the industry,
from a huge factory
the workers on vacation
came to help for the construction
in the sponsored village.
Its director in the lead,
the kolkhoz builds a common stable.
The sponsors
set up a grain sorter.
We have to extend the farm.
We have to work the land together, with a tractor.
It's about time!
The old ones balk.
Why a tractor?
I am myself a machine!
Progressively, we get used to worked together.
We sorted out the seeds.
Preparations for the wedding.

It cuts the grass
turns the hay over
and picks it up.
The autumn.
Time has come to harvest.
If only we could have a machine!
Following your request,
you will find hereafter our answer...
Once overhead as above mentioned has been paid, the tractor will be delivered to the cooperative...
Everybody expressed such an eagerness...
We can not grant you a loan before your fields have been harvested.
We advise you to apply to the authority concerned.
With our kindest regards...
The harvest.
We've lost plenty of time in trying to pay back the expenses for the tractor.
Less political chatter!
Fight the bureaucracy.
Marfa goes to town as a delegate
to ask for a tractor.
40 versts... 140 more Up to the town to implore the sponsors to help.
We are going to be left without a tractor!

In 1997, a reconstruction and photochemical restoration of the film as it had originally been intended was created by the Fondazione Cineteca di Bologna, the Deutsche Filminstitut
- DIF, Frankfurt am Main, and the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, Wiesbaden.
It is based on the dupe negative from the Danish Film Institute, Copenhagen.
Most of the missing scenes were added from a contemporary copy from the Archivo Nacional de la Imagen - Sodre, Montevideo.
The wording of the German intertitles was recreated with the aid of German-French intertitles from a copy at the Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique, Brussels.
A few surviving German titles from the copy at the Archivo Nacional de la Imagen
- Sodre, Montevideo served as a model for the typography.
The master negative ofthis edit was used for the 2K digital version.
For this HD mastering, the image has been corrected in places, and heavy damage to the film has been retouched.

I want to be here for you!
I'll tell you what happened with Elisabeth!
- I'll tell you everything!
And she doesn't want to say who the father is.
You have to marry her.
Yes, ifthe pharmacy weren't so heavily mortgaged - - !
Of course, Thymian must be asked, too.
I can't marry him, I don't even love him - - !
Don't lay a finger on the innocent child, - you - !

Dear Father,
Dear Osdorff, I am so unhappy.
Your nephew still doesn't want to obey, Herr Count.
I've tried everything with you, every school and every trade, you've failed at all ofthem!
Now I've had enough!
See how far you get on your own.
In the reformatory one lived according to the house-rules.
And so the housekeeper became the lady ofthe house.
Thymian's Room
NURSERY
Count Osdorff resolved to help Thymian.
Dear Osdorff, I am so unhappy.
What did I actually do that I am treated so strictly and cruelly?
...because Meta has Father wrapped around her finger.
I beg you to go to him. Perhaps then I'll be able to go home again.
Yours, Thymian
- ... I'm afraid to write to Father, Meta is so mean... -
I heard that your uncle has thrown you out - -
- - go now to Thymian. You belong together:
the outcast and the lost girl.
Go to her - tell her something nice - !
Here the pharmacy won't be auctioned offto you just yet, now that I possess the mortgages.
Even the strictest discipline cannot repress the girls' desire to look pretty.
PUNISH ERIKA
Count Nikolaus Osdorff
The Count claims to come on behalf ofyour father.
No-one at home wants to know anything more about you,
Meta has married your father.
Steal the key, and I'll help you further.
I'll wait for you tonight in front ofyour house!
I know where we can stay.
No, I want to go to my child.
I'll write down for you where I can be found.

I'd like to see my child.
Little Erika Henning - -
She happens to be dead - -
He just took her away.
Where you headed, luv?
- - to Erika!
Erika and Count Osdorff are received with open arms by the proprietress ofthe establishment.
And what's more, he leaves his regards!
Oh, be reasonable, little one, you don't even have a shirt on your back!
Ifyour friend helps you, you'll be outta this whole mess!
I'm penniless, and my uncle won't give me anything more!
I want to go to work!
What are you able to do, my poor little thing?
Be so kind as to place this advert in the paper.

Little child, how did you end up here...?
...I tell you, you'll bitterly regret this!
That's Dr. Vitalis - he always wants to save us but in the end he joins us.
You look like you're at a funeral, dear friend;
try and be a li'l happy!
I know how I'll help:
we'll do a lottery for you.
Once a year the pharmacist takes his wife out on the town.
So here you have the seamy side ofthe big city.
And what can you win with the lot?
Yes, Thymian, now you are a lost girl -
- just as we're all lost!
Three years have passed since the painful meeting between father and daughter.
Thymian still leads the same life.
After a brief, trying illness, my beloved husband, the pharmacist Karl Friedrich Henning passed away yesterday, on the 17th ofJune, 1929.
INHERITANCE NOTICES
Thymian Henning, as legal heir to Herr Henning's estate, is requested to attend the reading ofthe will, which will take place in the house ofthe deceased.
Money will enter the house - over a short course - by way of a dark lady!
Why, you're rich!
Yes, I could start another life - -
For another life - you need a new identity!
He should marry her!
Countess Thymian Osdorff, there's an identity!
You insist on exercising your right to take over the pharmacy and drive your friend's poor widow out of her home?
Countess, Herr Meinert has redeemed the mortgage of45,000 marks that you inherited from your mother... and thus becomes the sole owner ofthe pharmacy.
Where's all the money? -
I gave it to my little sister, so she doesn't end up like me.
Am I to blame in the end?
I, his uncle, bear most ofthe blame.
I should never have repudiated that helpless lad!
May I attempt to repay you with the debt I owe him?
We're now in Swinemünde.
Uncle Osdorff is so kind to me.
My former life often seems like an ugly, terrible dream.
Cousin Osdorff - !
My niece - Countess Osdorff.
Little Thymian, you don't recognise me anymore?
Dear Countess, I hope you'll let me take care ofyou.
I'd like - for us to leave!
We beg you, dear Countess, to work with us in our society for saving wayward young girls.
Countess Thymian Osdorff is invited to the board meeting and to examine our institution on 19 August 1929.
Our youngest member - Countess Osdorff.
Today we have an especially difficult case.
A young girl has once again been entrusted to us who has struck down our every educational measure by repeatedly running away.
How we've worried about her -
My dear, try the soup they make here!
Yet she constantly turns away from the blessings of our home -
I know this house and its "blessings" -
Your ignorance won't help her -
I want to try, for I was once what she is.
A little more love and no-one would be lost in this world!

Today seems to be the right time for a kidnapping.
Do you want me to find a good hiding-place?
You're making funny faces.
Do you know how to make the snail face?
I'll take you to a funny place.
I want to go back home!
I want to go back!
This kid seems very nice.
Is there anything you can do?
Yes, I know how to make the hippopotamus.
But first, you show me something.
You know, I can also imitate Matsunosuke.
Flattery is useless.
Get him out of here and abandon him.
You must take a lot of money when you go out.
Fed up of taking care of him, the kidnapper is going back where he got him.
Show me the snail face again.
You know, I'm a kidnapper.
You don't look like a kidnapper.

It's nice to hear French music once in a while, isn't it?
Yes, people must be getting fed up with jazz.
-Is that your costume?
-No, they're fixing it.
They're redoing the feathers.
They're redoing the feathers?
-What about you?
-My pants are too small.
Your pants are too small?
Are you sure? What do you do?
-What do you mean?
-In the show?
-Oh, I'm the water lily.
-And you?
I'm the crane.
Larivière!
What'd I say?
You have another bird coming in with a flower!
They're new. They weren't here yesterday.
So what?
Birds on the right!
Flowers in front!
-Or the audience will be lost.
-As usual!
-Yes, sir!
-Let's go to the next act.
-Yes, sir.
"My little angels, "My little angels,
"Come to your mother's breast. "And you, vile seducer,
"must face my sword to get her back. "Don't you dare try to take him from me.

My Lady.
OK, girls, time for the 15th act!
-Legris!
-Yes? -Ready?
-Yes, sir.
Let's go!
Stop!
Ladies, you're holding guns, not syringes.
Continue.
Larivière!
Larivière!
Off the stage! You're in their way.
-Mr. Bastien! -Yes?
Can't you get your girl to sing in tune?
I tried, but there's nothing we can do.
Go on.
She's our silent partner's favorite.
-Jules. -Yes.
This dress rehearsal is going to be painful.
You should change your costume, dear.
-Blanche! Costume change. -Yes, ma'am.
Clear the stage!
Next act!
-Let's go!
You wouldn't believe me.
But I won't tell you, because you'll print it.
Don't be rude.
He's a journalist.
Quiet, André.
You wouldn't believe where we've been.
When I look back, it's been hard for André and me.
We've toured the country in unheated, 3rd class trains.
And dirty, stuffy rooms... Think he's interested in that?
Of course he is.
Aren't you? -See?
-Alright, then.
My husband and I met in a show in St. Étienne.
They paid us peanuts, so we didn't eat every day, as you can imagine.
Then there was Maubeuge.
The audience was on both sides of the stage.
We sang for the right side first, then the middle, then the left.
So the left side only heard the end! -And Limoges!
-Oh, yeah! We weren't paid there either, just fed.
The lead actor did the cooking.
You can imagine the food!
We also got coffee and postcard profits, which was nice, right?
-Yes. -You know...
It wasn't always funny at the time.
I was lucky to have my husband.
He's very talented. Much more so than me.
Be sure to add that.
-No, don't.
-Yes, add it. Quiet.
Come here.
We've never left each other.
We've always worked together.
We kept each other's spirits up.
We'd tell each other our luck would change someday.
It sure did.
We're in Paris now.
Our act is very good, very original.
-He came up with it.
-I did. He got the idea when we were in the country.
We love the countryside.
-One day... -There's no stopping her now!
I have to see the conductor about the cut we made.
-Fine.
-Excuse me. Give me a goodbye kiss!
-There!
-A little.
-Don't be mean.
I adore you.
-See you later. -Yes.
What was I...? Right, the country.
We just love the country.
We always planned to buy a house when we would have enough money.
Quiet!
They're doing a number.
André!
Want some candy?
André!
-Yes?
Have a cigarette.
Did you practice with the orchestra?
There's no need to call me "ma'am."
We're alone.
Call me Yvette.
You're not only the star, you're the director. And there's my wife to think of.
She might not understand.
I don't want to hurt her under any circumstances.
It took you a while to come up with that!
Do you love your wife?
Of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?
That's what I thought.
Ridiculous! I don't see how that's ridiculous.
I'm not the only man who loves his wife.
She didn't come down with you?
No, she's in our dressing room. A journalist is interviewing her about how she got started.
Have some champagne with me.
-No, thank you.
-Yes, it'll help with your act.
If you were a reasonable young man, André,
I'd have a proposition for you.
The boss has found a new guy!
-She can't help herself.
-She has to try them all.
"André, I have a proposition for you."
I know what kind!
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Goodbye.
-Where's Ms. Gary's room?
-More champagne?
-No, thank you.
About that...
You know, André, you could be in my summer show.
We'd make a lovely couple.
You'd benefit from my name.
I have an idea for a sensational act, one people will talk about.
With your name next to mine, it could be your big break.
I run things around here, so just say the word.
Wouldn't it be nice, André?
I'm going!
Ladies of Louis XIV's court! Do I have to drag you down the stairs?
This is unbelievable!
Got nothing to say?
I'm not saying no.
Obviously, it would be great.
Let's talk about it over dinner tonight.
A friendly dinner.
We'll talk it over.
It's a date!
It would be a pleasure, but I really can't, because of my wife.
You don't have to tell her.
You'll see her afterwards. Come to my place as soon as you're done.
No, I really can't.
I won't mention it again.
Blanche!
Quickly!
This isn't going to work.
I'll be going, then.
You're so clumsy!
It's not like that at all.
My legs have had enough!
Well, I've had 12 costume changes!
Isn't life grand?
-Shoot, I broke a nail!
-What time is it?
2 AM.
The 14th act is starting!
Ready, Gaby?
We're up next.
They finished Louis XIV's Court and started Babylon Gardens.
It's about time.
I'm fed up with waiting.
The makeup is nice.
Pass me the matches.
I need to tell the orchestra about the cut we made.
I got stopped on the way and I forgot.
We'll see. It's just a rehearsal.
Wish we could get it over with.
Did you tell them about the lighting?
I'm out of powder.
Can you pass me yours?
You're awfully quiet.
Look at me.
What's wrong, Gaby?
Did something happen?
-You went downstairs to see her.
-Me? I heard you two.
She asked you to be her partner and you had champagne.
Then she shut the door, so I couldn't hear more.
-You're crazy.
-No, I'm not.
I heard you clearly.
She wants you, but she doesn't need you.
That's crazy.
Are you jealous?
That's silly.
You know I love you. I'm lucky to have you. I'd be a fool to be with another woman.
Are you trying to hurt me?
Haven't we been happy together?
Do you want to ruin it all over nothing?
Over nothing...
I hate her! If she tries to split us up, I'll get her!
Enough!
Are you trying to make me mad?
I love you, only you.
Hear me?
-Are you sure? -Of course.
Don't be silly!
We're going to be a huge hit.
Our act is great. We're gonna make a lot of money. I'll buy you that house in the country.
And if anyone talks about theatre,
So you won't talk to her again?
-No. -She's ugly.
And old! She's 42!
The costume girl told me.
-42?
-And have you seen her hair?
It's not real.
It's a wig.
It's true, her dresser told me.
And that voice!
There's nothing more grating. Hardly anyone knows her name.
Well, maybe in a few places...
I'm just telling you what I think.
And have you seen her legs?
They're awful!
You've got her all figured out!
-You won't talk to her again?
-Promise?
-Yes. I know you.
You can be weak.
-Swear.
-Of course!
No, say "I swear."
I swear.
Happy now?
Get me a brandy, will you?
A big one. -A big brandy?
-Yes.
A big brandy, please.
It's for my wife.
Great, thanks.
Put it on my tab.
-How's the act?
-Good, we're on soon.
It's always the same thing.
Take this and get my handkerchief.
-Got my fan?
-What's this piece?
-A popular Argentinean song.
-It's nice.
That's a costume I could wear.
It'd be a change from feathers.
They always cover me in them!
This is too long.
The audience will fall asleep!
Give it a minute, dear.
It just started.
Who's that woman?
-I don't like her!
-It's an original act, though.
It's not bad.
Maybe with another actress.
My handkerchief, Blanche!
She's still not back?
What could she be doing?
There you are!
Thank you.
Stay close, I'll need you.
-Did you close my door?
-Yes. Did you lock it?
Fine, then.
I can't do it!
She won't stop talking!
I've had enough!
You should leave!
-Calm down.
-No, I won't calm down.
I heard her what she said about me.
-Enough! -Let me go!
I don't like her either!
I'll take notes from the director.
Everyone else should shut up!
Let me go!
She's jealous!
-Enough! -She's jealous!
I don't want her in the show!
-But the act is...
-Fine, I'll take her role.
-Sure. -You'll see the difference!
That's the final word.
-What am I to you?
-Everything!
Cut the act or I'm taking her role.
What do you want me to say?
Your wife is a problem.
-We couldn't practice.
-But what happened is a problem.
You can't cut our act.
It's sure to be a hit!
I'm not the only one in charge.
-Think about your losses.
-There won't be any.
-You'll get a severance.
-That's not what worries me.
After all these years, we finally got to Paris.
What can I say, André?
I feel for you, but there's nothing I can do.
Go talk to her.
I would if I were you.
-Think so?
-It's worth a try.
-Think it'll work?
-It's your only hope.
Fine, I'll try.
Oh...
Don't tell my wife.
You know how she can be.
-I'm counting on you.
-Understood.
Looking for something, sir?
Ms. Delys's dressing room.
End of the hall, then up the stairs.
-Legris!
-Yes? -Leave the set for tomorrow.
-Very well.
Think I'm in for it with the girls?
Don't worry, it'll work out.
Sure, it always does.
One way or another.
Come here, ladies!
You're finished for tonight!
Be back here at noon tomorrow!
-Yvette.
We're waiting on you.
-Without dinner?
Not tonight.
I'm going home.
-See you tomorrow.
-Goodnight.
-Yes, me.
-How?
You already got out?
Already?
Guess the time flew for you.
I got out yesterday.
Why come here? Anyone see you?
-Is that you, Blanche?
-Don't come up.
You can go home.
-Fine, ma'am.
Goodnight.
Nice welcome after being gone 5 years.
Cut to the chase.
What do you want?
-A little money.
-I don't have any!
I'm sure I'm in trouble.
Hope they didn't cut our act.
Your act is really good.
-That's what made her mad.
-Exactly.
That awful woman is jealous!
I got it, Gaby.
Give her another so she stops.
I'm done, don't worry.
How's work, Mr. Bonneau?
Not great.
You always complain.
Look at that face.
You'd think he was at a funeral!
That's enough.
-Not making enough money?
-OK, OK.
-Look at these.
-Hardly brandy glasses!
More like thimbles!
-Want another?
-No, I'm done.
-I have to see what happened.
-It'll be fine. -As long as they didn't cut it.
-They won't! That woman could do anything.
-How much do we owe you?
-I got it.
-It's on me.
-No. You always pay.
You're a good friend, you know.
There aren't many in our field.
That's why I can't stand women.
-See you tomorrow!
-See you!
So what'd they say?
It's going to work out.
She's not gonna get an apology.
Certainly not from me. Absolutely not.
-Where are you going?
-To see the boss.
-Why?
-He thinks our act needs work.
-What does that mean?
-I don't know.
Probably just a few cuts.
I'm having dinner with him.
You're seeing her!
-Come on!
-I heard you two earlier.
-You're going!
-Gaby!
You don't care about me or the act!
-That's ridiculous!
-I get it now!
You arranged for her to make that scene during our act.
You wanted me to get upset.
It was all planned!
I'm begging you.
Don't go, André.
Don't leave me alone.
I'm still upset about earlier.
-You've got the wrong idea.
-Please don't go, honey.
If you go, I don't want to ever see you again!
Be reasonable.
-I'm late, I have to go.
-She'd better watch out.
She doesn't know what I can do!
I'm going to talk about our contract!
You don't care about the contract!
I don't care!
I don't care who hears me!
She doesn't know what I'm capable of!
André!
I don't know, Mr. Larivière. Have you seen the poster? Because I have.
I needed a microscope to find my name!
That's awful, young man, just awful.
Say, Flamberger. Do you remember the infamous parade in the last show? That night, the boss said,
"Larivière, you don't even know how to climb stairs!"
I've lived on the 6th floor for 30 years.
Young people know nothing about theater.
I played the lead in all kinds of plays in Carcassonne.
Let me tell you one thing.
It'll be beneficial to you, young man.
When I was in "Léonard ou les Égoutiers,"
there was a chorus in act II.
Remember?
The famous chorus!
"Sewer workers are good men."
"No one can refute that."
That's what we sang back then.
It was at least as good as what they sing nowadays.
-Where's the manager? -On his rounds.
What's my boss up to?
Everybody's gone at this hour.
It's always the same thing!
I like theater, but I'm fed up!
She's tough to please.
I get yelled at all the time.
You have a good job!
Think so?
I'll wait until my Christmas bonus, then I'm quitting!
Young man, theater is a thing of the past.
So are actors.
Did you see me in "Les Oubliettes du Vieux Louvre"?
What a fond memory.
In "Le Crétin de la Montagne," I played the idiot, of course.
You should have seen the audience.
"Sire, I'm waiting for the ring."
"To do what, Bertrand?"
"To do what?"
"To die on the day the Emperor dies."
"They won't stain..." "these tears."
If you'd only seen it, young man. There isn't the same feeling anymore.
There isn't the same artistic satisfaction.
Think of the plays we did...
He's not here?
-He's on his rounds, sir.
Larivière, tell him the fire department is coming tomorrow.
-What's that?
-Help!
A killer's on the loose!
What's wrong, Bonneau?
-A killer!
-Who? Ms. Delys...
in her dressing room! Call the police.
-Is she dead?
-Yes.
How awful!
-Go take a look!
-Yes, sir.
-Take the lead, Bonneau. -No, I can't.
There are 6 of us!
Yvette Delys... muddled... molded...murdered!
It's terrible, just terrible!
She's in here.
There's blood!
Oh, I can't look!
-Call the police!
Looks like she defended herself.
-Did it just happen?
-The killer must still be here!
Was she strangled?
-Don't say anything!
Oh, it's you, Flamberger.
OK.
Yes.
Get the doctor.
-No, there's a knife.
-I'm not!
I'm just looking.
-That knife... -What about it?
It's Gaby's knife! Yes, from her act.
-It does look like hers.
-Impossible.
-Don't touch!
-OK, OK!
-Is this 2237?
-What? -Is this 2237?
-So, it's the theater?
Yes.
Is Ms. Delys still there?
-She's not home, either.
-Is this André?
Yes.
What?
We found Ms. Delys dead in her dressing room. -What?
She was stabbed.
By whom?
We don't know, looks like revenge.
-I can't believe it.
-Yes.
The knife looks like...
-Hello?
-Don't talk about it.
Hello?
Hello, hello. Get me the police station.
Who are you? Let go!
No need to yell.
Let go! Help!
André!
Let go!
Help!
-Get her to police headquarters.
We shall proceed with the cross-examination.
I advise you to follow the proceedings closely and to listen carefully to the charges brought against you.
Remember, each of your answers will carry significant weight. Your parents lived in Bordeaux and loved you very much.
They spent a considerable amount to ensure you had an excellent education.
In spite of that, you left home without any explanation at the age of 16.
My authoritarian father wanted me to marry a man I didn't love.
Firstly, from a very young age, you rebelled against discipline.
Secondly, you already lacked scruples. I've always regretted leaving...
My father was inflexible. I had to obey him or leave.
I tried to obey him, but the man I was to marry was an imposter.
I wanted to tell my parents, but my father refused to listen. That's why I left, but the money was mine.
I'd been saving up since my childhood.
She, herself, would admit that her father did not believe her.
This proves that Ms. Delange was accustomed to lying from a young age and her father no longer trusted her.
I'd like the jury to take into account that this information about my client was taken from a few neighbors and should not be taken seriously.
Your Honor, would the defendant please remove her hat.
Let's move on to a later date in St. Étienne. You met André Robert, with whom you now live.
You call him your husband, but you've never been married.
-No, your Honor. -But you live together.
You're both dancers.
Let's skip over the years prior to your time in Paris.
You're currently preparing a pantomime act.
You wear a costume in it.
The costume includes a knife attached to your belt in a leather sheath, correct? -Yes, your Honor.
-Is it also true that in the pantomime, you use the knife frequently?
-Yes. -Here are 2 established facts.
Please listen carefully.
On the night of September 14, rehearsals were underway at the Folies Montmartre for the winter show.
That night, you had a violent argument with the victim.
Shortly after, Ms. Delys was found dead in her dressing room, stabbed to death with your knife.
The weapon had been thrown at the victim with the same precision and accuracy as in your act.
Yvette Delys was fatally stabbed and the killer got away, leaving your knife in the wound.
Gabrielle Delange, that killer was you. It's not true!
It wasn't me!
It's a horrible accusation!
Why did you arm yourself with a knife before going to the victim's dressing room?
I wasn't armed with a knife, your Honor.
I had it on me when I left my dressing room.
It was part of my costume, but I didn't notice.
When I got to Ms. Delys's room, I didn't think about having it.
-You didn't think about it? -No.
Yet, you threatened the victim with it during your interaction. No, I didn't threaten her.
I'm going to have to contradict you.
A witness who was passing by during your conversation with Ms. Delys claimed he heard someone yell,
It's true, I threatened her, but only with words.
I swear, I never used my knife.
I'll explain.
I love my husband.
We're not married, but it's like we are.
We've been together so long.
We've had good days and bad days, but we're happy because we love each other.
I asked her what right she had to take him away from me, to shatter our existence. I wanted her to promise to leave him alone, but she just laughed.
When I saw she was mocking me,
I lost my head. I went towards her.
I might've made a gesture that she took as a threat.
But if I did, I didn't realize it. I swear, I never threatened her with my knife.
Never! How can you explain it, then?
When she screamed, I realized she was afraid of the knife.
So I threw it on the ground.
You've admitted you threatened the victim, but only with words. What were those words?
I don't remember exactly.
You don't remember.
That defense isn't new and it won't get you anywhere.
It's not a defense, your Honor.
It's the truth expressed by someone incapable of lying.
Or a convenient method for avoiding a question.
That's a sly use of psychology to sway the jury.
No, I'll leave it to you to make up stories that tug at the heartstrings of gossips.
Please note that the prosecutor has called the jury "gossips."
I'll ask you for the last time to remember your words.
They were insults, whatever came into my head.
You don't always remember what you say in anger.
I knew my husband was at her place.
To scare her, I said I'd keep her from going there by force.
Once I said that, I stopped.
She said, "Are you crazy?
"Why would I stay here if your husband's at my place?
"Work it out for yourselves." Then she turned around.
I didn't know what to say.
I wasn't expecting indifference.
I didn't know how to answer.
I was upset, I didn't even have it in me to cry.
I thought I might faint.
So I left her alone and she slammed the door behind me.
You told investigators you couldn't remember what time you left the theater.
The building manager, Mr. Bonneau, claimed he saw you leave 10 minutes before the crime was discovered.
The crime was discovered at 4:05 AM. So you must've left the theater at 3:55 AM. That's impossible!
I left well before then.
He must have lied!
Why would he have lied?
Because it's impossible.
I saw the time at the Quai d'Orsay train station.
It was definitely 4 AM.
It's more than a 5 minute walk.
You remember that now?
Anyway, let's move on.
What were you doing at the Quai d'Orsay station at 4 AM?
I was completely distraught.
I didn't want to go back to an empty room without my husband, so I walked around.
Near the Quai d'Orsay station?
Yes, along the Seine.
Along the Seine?
You were about to kill yourself by jumping into the river, yet you noticed the time?
It's the truth.
I was looking into the water when I noticed the clock's reflection.
It felt like someone was watching over me. As I looked at it, the clock chimed 4:00.
So you immediately decided not to kill yourself?
Why did you change your mind?
I got scared.
You then went back to the hotel, where you were arrested.
That was about 5:30 AM. What did you do in between?
I walked around, trying to calm down.
-Did you run into anyone? -No, your Honor.
You walked around Paris for an hour and a half without running into anyone?
You know that type of defense...
I must defend the defendant's rights. I firmly believe in my client's innocence.
It was never a question...
It's easy to be disdainful
-of the defense's rights! -I'm respecting your rights. -Only in words!
-In deed as well!
You only respect the form!
You can't claim for an instant...
Enough, Counselors.
It's been insinuated that the prosecutor has failed to respect the defendant's rights. However, throughout this hearing, he has shown the utmost impartiality.
Your Honor, I commend the prosecutor for his impartiality.
The weapon was thrown with so much force that it caused a deadly wound to the thorax. Dr. Louis, please look at my client.
Ms. Delange, please stand up.
I have a question for you.
You said the weapon was thrown with extreme force.
For the record, the prosecutor has claimed the crime could have been committed by anyone.
Provided they could throw a knife as skillfully as the defendant.
That isn't impossible.
Does the defendant have anything to add to this testimony?
Does the jury, prosecution or defense have any questions?
No, your Honor.
You're dismissed, doctor.
Call witness Georges Barreau.
Can you tell us the exact time you were in her dressing room?
Approximately 3 AM.
When you left her dressing room at 3 AM, did you run into anyone?
Ms. Delange was on her way out. She went right back to her room.
Did her attitude seem suspicious?
Perhaps.
I didn't pay attention.
Did you notice a knife in her hand?
-I didn't have it!
-I didn't notice.
Ms. Delange, when you entered the victim's dressing room, did you see the money the cashier had given her?
No, I wasn't paying attention. The 20,000 f has never been found.
Mr. Barreau...
I put the money in my pocket and brought it to Ms. Delys, so no one could have seen me. Your Honor, in the interest of getting to the truth,
I'd like to question Mr. Bonneau. Call him in.
When the victim called you to send the cashier, what time was it?
Around 2:30 AM. Are you sure?
Yes, sir, 2:30, maybe a bit earlier.
-It couldn't have been.
-Why not?
I was in the theater at 2:30, watching the rehearsal.
On my way to my office to get my hat, I noticed it was 3 AM.
That's when I got the call. Mr. Bonneau, we have a witness claiming it was 3 AM.
It couldn't have been.
That's when I was serving Ms. Delange at the bar.
She had 3 brandies.
She was very upset and angry.
She was saying, "That woman is jealous. "I don't know what I'll do to her."
You've already told us that.
You accused the defendant of a suspicious animosity.
However, one point has been contradicted by a witness whose honesty is above suspicion.
No more than his own! He's also under oath.
I won't allow anyone to question his honesty!
Does the defendant have anything to add?
Does the jury, the defense or the prosecution have anything to add?
-No, your Honor.
-Call the next witness.
Larivière!
Larivière!
-Désiré Larivière, 74. -Occupation?
Former lead actor in all genres.
Following that, a diction professor for 1 month, and, temporarily, assistant stage manager at the Folies Montmartre.
One has to make a living. You live at 47 Trois-Couronnes.
You aren't a relative or employee of the defendant?
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I swear, your Honor. -Only "I swear."
-I swear.
Proceed.
"Beware, my son, of accusing the innocent.
"The gods, both fair and good, will look out for their defense.
"By uncovering the facts, "judges and witnesses will discover the truth.
-"The gods..." -Excuse me.
Are you reciting verse?
Exactly, your Honor.
It's in the second act...
You're not on stage. Tell us what you know about the crime.
Where were you on September 15 at 3 AM?
Pardon? Where were you when the crime was committed?
-Pardon?
-Address the jury. Er...
On the night of...
Where was I?
That's a funny question.
On the night of...
Oh, I remember!
I was at the bar, having a drink with a friend,
Flamberger. He's Alsatian, your Honor. We were at the bar.
A drink from time to time takes the edge off.
It doesn't make you an alcoholic.
I was there with Flamberger.
He's also an artist, a great one, actually.
He hasn't been successful, but we're not all successful, your Honor.
Otherwise... Please stick to the facts.
Yes, your Honor.
I understand.
At the time, I was telling him a story about my past.
So, obviously... Er...
Let's finish this up!
Then what? Then what?
That's it.
-That's all.
-That's all?
Yes, your Honor.
Oh, yeah!
I was having a drink with Flamberger.
We were having a drink.
Then, all of a sudden, we heard screams.
That's the truth, your Honor. We heard noises in the night.
Screams!
Screams, I tell you! So, everybody went to look.
But I, your Honor,
I stayed back alone. -That's it. -And?
And?
-That's all.
-That's all you know? I swear.
Fine, take a seat.
Thank you. No, thank you, your Honor.
Call the next witness.
Mr. Larivière... The judge certainly looked the part.
André Robert! André Robert!
André Robert, 30, artist.
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
Raise your right hand and say, "I swear."
-I swear. -Lower your hand.
I swore you in because you aren't legally married to the defendant.
We're aware of your situation.
Please don't let your feelings for her impede the truth.
Proceed with your testimony. I have nothing to say, your Honor.
-Address the jury.
I don't know what happened.
She couldn't have committed this crime.
I know her after 8 years together.
Stick to the facts directly related to the crime and, again, address the jury.
I'm sorry, it's upsetting to see her this way.
I don't know
I'd left the theater, but I know she's innocent.
We had an argument that night, a rather serious one, but it was my fault.
I know she gets jealous and I should've listened to her.
I hope she can forgive me.
It was my fault she was upset.
I'd like to repair things here.
Please forgive me.
I forgave you long ago.
This isn't your fault.
But if I'd told you the truth, if I hadn't...
Please tell us what you know.
Your Honor, she couldn't have done this!
That night, she tried to keep me from going.
If I'd listened, we'd have left together and you'd know she wasn't guilty.
You can't convict her without proof. It wasn't me. I didn't do it.
It wasn't me!
This testimony adds nothing.
His protests can't refute the mounting evidence.
I'd like to remind the jury how often the defense has endured unjustified attacks from the prosecution.
-My client... -Your client is a great actress.
I'm sure some of her tears are real, but her exaggerated emotions are characteristic of her trade. How dare you say that!
She's in tears and has claimed her innocence since her arrest. She keeps saying she didn't do it. How can you say such a thing?
Is her paleness acting too? And her tears? Her sobs?
Her weight loss? Is that acting?
You can't mistake her sincerity!
Yes, I mentioned something during the investigation, but nothing's been done about it.
That night, I ran into a man hiding backstage.
Yes, you mentioned it during the investigation. He was acting strange, like I'd caught him.
I asked him what he wanted.
He said Yvette Delys's room.
-So I directed him. -And?
Why haven't they found this man?
No one else saw the man you claim to have met.
He was lurking about, looking worried he'd be caught.
What was he doing there?
Why was he hiding?
I'm sure he's the killer.
I've done all I can to find him.
I have people still looking for him. Why go to Yvette Delys's room?
Why hide? You've already asked these questions.
We couldn't find him.
But I saw him.
How do you know he's not the killer?
You're here to answer questions, not ask them, Mr. Robert.
A full investigation was done.
You've done your best to find this man.
However, he hasn't been found.
If he can't be found, he likely doesn't exist.
You're excused. Take the defendant away.
Hearing adjourned.
There are a few more witnesses, but they've agreed to finish tonight.
Thanks. It was a good show, very good, indeed.
However, it could've been better.
When we put on "Roger La Honte" in Nevers, there was a courtroom scene.
Of course, I played Noirville. André!
I think we found him!
Nénette found him.
-Where? -I'll take you.
Let's go!
It's him!
He's the killer!
No, I'm not!
I don't know what you're talking about.
-You don't?
Remember me from the theater on the night of the crime?
-It wasn't me! -You're coming with us.
-Court!
What for?
-You're the killer!
-No, I'm innocent!
She says she doesn't know, that she doesn't remember.
Regardless of what the defense says, this isn't about psychology.
That girl is a killer! She killed out of cowardice.
She's not only a killer, she's also a thief!
Gentlemen of the jury, you're about to hear a defense argued by a lawyer who raised the pitch of this hearing.
He may even allude to the specter of judicial error.
Don't let him instill doubt in you. You've brought here a respect for justice and the strength of your opinion.
I ask you to resist sentimentality.
Remember, Ms. Delange is, and always has been, an actress.
Her claims of innocence, her tears and her lies are all an act to try to sway you.
Moreover, this woman didn't even come up with an alibi.
She's too smart not to think her lie would be discovered.
"It wasn't me. I didn't do it. I'm innocent."
Lies! This woman is a liar!
She's tried to appear mysterious in an attempt to create doubt in your minds.
Don't fall into her trap.
Weigh the evidence and find her guilty, as she deserves by answering yes to the questions you're asked.
Justice must prevail. The truth must come out. Do not be trapped into feeling pity or mercy.
We live in a time when too many take justice into their own hands.
Don't confuse pity with weakness. The killer is here.
A weak verdict on your part would mean a breach in the ramparts built to protect our society.
Your weakness would only encourage future crimes.
I've fulfilled my duties. I ask that you do the same.
Now for the defense.
Before giving my closing argument,
His testimony may have a major impact for my client.
Prosecutor, do you object to hearing this new testimony?
No, I do not. Call the witness.
Henri Capelle, 41.
None.
You're not a relative or employee of the defendant?
I didn't swear you in because you weren't on the witness list.
The jury will only use your testimony for informational purposes.
What do you know about the crime committed at the Folies Montmartre?
I don't know anything. Where were you on the night of September 14?
-I was home.
-That's a lie, your Honor!
Remain quiet or I'll clear the room.
You said you were home.
I live at 18 Goutte d'Or.
-But at that time...
-At that time? When the crime was committed, I wasn't home.
You should be careful what you say.
You seem unaware of the serious allegations made against you.
You were seen in the theatre on the night of the crime.
-You appeared to be hiding. -Yes.
I might as well spill it.
It'll do me good.
I went to the theatre that night to see Yvette Delys.
She was my wife.
-Your wife?
-Yes. We were married 12 years ago.
She didn't want anyone to know because as a successful actress, it would hinder her from building her career, etc.
Anyway. It was fine with me because she brought in a lot of money.
I didn't have anything to do with the crime, though.
After 5 years in prison, you learn a thing or two.
I figured if I came forward...
Since I was seen in the area the night my wife died and I have a police record, and all that, they'd pin it on me for sure.
They wouldn't believe me and I'd be finished!
I'm not impressed with your opinion.
And you should watch your language.
Let's move on.
You claim you went to your wife for money. -Did she give you any?
-Yes, 5,000 f.
The theater cashier claimed he gave her 20,000 f.
I'd asked for 20,000, but she only gave me 5,000.
I said it wasn't much and I'd be back soon.
So, the victim kept 15,000 f?
Yes, she put it on her vanity.
If I were dishonest, I could've swiped it all.
Did you see the manager when you came in?
No, he wasn't at his desk. He wasn't at his desk?
Your Honor, I'd like to question the building manager.
Call Mr. Bonneau.
Did you ever leave your desk the night of the crime?
I watched a bit of the rehearsal. You're in a position of trust.
You're supposed to guard the artist entrance.
You could be accused of being an accessory to the murder.
What do you have to say? I don't know.
You asked so many questions.
I don't speak as well as you. I didn't understand half of it.
-You didn't? -No.
Then I'll make myself clearer.
Here's another question.
The witness here present, whom you didn't see come in.
-Did you see him leave?
-Yes. Pardon?
-You saw me leave? -Of course. I was already back at my desk.
-You were at your desk?
I saw you when you left.
You're a liar!
How could you see me from your desk when I left through the public entrance?
How's that?
My wife didn't want anyone to see me.
She took me through the theater to the main entrance on the street.
How could you see me, then? How can you explain that? Perhaps I'm mistaken.
Where were you?
I may be mistaken. Maybe I was on my rounds.
You discovered the crime on your rounds?
Yes, your Honor.
When I got to Ms. Delys's room, the door was ajar and the lights were on.
I waited a minute, but I didn't hear anything.
I thought she might've left with the lights on.
So, I knocked on the door and went in.
That's when I saw her with the knife on the floor.
She didn't move. I got scared and ran to get the others.
-You said all that before. -Excuse me, your Honor.
You said the lights were on when you reached the victim's room?
Yes, sir. Then how could they be off when the driver went in?
What?
He claims he had to use the flashlight he had in his car.
I have another question.
You must've heard a gunshot on your rounds.
It's been established that the victim shot her assailant before being stabbed.
-You didn't hear a gunshot? -No, I didn't hear anything. Really?
You were very close by.
I'm hard of hearing, sir.
It's not an important detail.
Your Honor, I'd like your permission to perform a reenactment of the crime.
This is a sketch of the victim's room. I strongly object to this last-minute demonstration.
This isn't a theater, it's a French courtroom!
The defense is overstepping its bounds.
Prosecutor, you cannot restrict the defense's rights.
Your own rights may be restricted, but a lawyer's rights may not.
The average lawyer puts his energy into his argument, but it's in the hands of his adversary.
It's his right and I won't allow it to be compromised!
My client's freedom and, perhaps, her life are at stake.
I'm about to save her and have her charges dismissed.
She's not a criminal and I'll prove it.
Gentlemen of the jury, this is the scene,
the scene of the crime the witnesses testified about.
the scene only the killer knows about since he fled it.
He fled unseen and escaped punishment for his crime. I'll present you with the scene right now.
I'll go back to the night of the crime.
I'm backstage at the theater, deserted at this time of night. It's full of dark corners.
I'm walking behind Yvette Delys. She's undressed, wearing only this kimono.
She's leading her husband, who she wants to hide, to the exit. He escapes unseen.
Yvette Delys then heads back towards her dressing room.
The 15,000 f attracts one man's attention.
He sees the bills through her open door. He's fascinated by and drawn to them.
Thinking he's alone, since he doesn't hear anything, he tiptoes his way in.
Holding his breath, he takes the money. He wants to make a run for it, but he hears a noise.
It's the victim's footsteps heading towards the room.
What can he do?
He'll be caught! He rushes into the back room, which doesn't have a door.
That's when his eyes fall on a knife.
This weapon, which the defendant foolishly tossed. This weapon, left there, as if by evil design, was at his fingertips.
Yvette Delys suddenly comes back into the dressing room.
She walks into the back room, unaware of the danger. Suddenly the lights go out.
In the darkness, she can't see anything.
She only hears her heart racing with fear.
A minute passes, then several more.
Then she hears footsteps.
He brushes past her as he runs to the door.
"Who's there?" she cries.
She has a feeling that someone, perhaps armed, is hiding in the shadows.
So, she grabs her revolver.
She points her ivory-handled revolver into the dark, in the direction of the noise she heard, and she shoots.
He's the killer!
Yes, sir. I was young and handsome then...

is he fair-skinned or dark?"
"Neither!
I don't get stood up!"
"Annie's on the phone.
Do you want to go to the movies tonight?"
"What's all the fuss?
That Garbo film is showing until Tuesday!"
"So what about tomorrow?"
"Fine.
Sunday!"

She's still in bed!"

THE END.
-Thirty thousand. - From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on. You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad. There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honor of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it, is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy, and let a claim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war, that there will be few losses.
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
And he is dreaming, I suppose, of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller, and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honor calls you.
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer, and I wonder what you are going to do.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
- I'm not gonna stay home!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together. That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right. - I'll go.
- That's the way!
Hey! Let's sing!
- Keep in line there, soldiers.
- Anything you say, General.
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report. Fall out!
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Bayonet drill. That's what I want.
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Well, for the love of -- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say? - I was going to say--
- Never mind!
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss. We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman. - Silence!
Get in some kind of a line!
Line up, I say!
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
You're not much to begin with, but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding, and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
Detachment... lie down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good! Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut. This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!
Squad, left march!
Detachment... halt!
Himmelstoss.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left. Detachment...
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm! It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him-- just one.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down. I feel mean.
You're not going to desert, are you?
Listen. I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
- Cover!
- Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Come on! Behn, come on!
Behn!
- Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "l. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh. Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry? - Yes.
Wait a minute! That's no invitation.
Can you pay?
I have some money.
No, not money. That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars, - or soap, cognac-- - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
- Bring everything you got.
- I'd be glad to give you-- - Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat! - Hmm? - You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where? - Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks. I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep, and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm. You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here. Don't be so backward.
Listen, children. All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop, only try to beat me to it.
Give me a couple of those. That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
- Bombardment.
I can't see!
- My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see! - It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him--
- You'll get killed!
- Let me-- - Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on. Get your packs and fall in.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of -- - Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
- Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it! - Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah. - Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
That's Oscar.
The son of a--
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't- - It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much. It's keeping up all night--
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No. I was just asking.
- Wanna play some more?
- All right. My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
- The kid's all right.
Yeah, yeah. Let him sleep.
He's dreamin'.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no. It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's bad enough in here as it is. Every--
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right. Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir? - I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight? Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
- Let's go after 'em!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
Grab your rifles!
- Get your grenades here.
Back to your own lines!
- And hurry up.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here. Get the rest.
- Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
And I cooked for 150!
All right. We'll have enough for once.
Come on. Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
- Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line! Get back in line!
- Oh, no! That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen. You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
All right. We're the 2nd Company.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on. Dish it out. - Come on!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon, and you're scared-- it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip, and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines, we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... - or we wreck the joint!
- Come on! Give us-- - Attention!
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- And bring me a plate too.
All right. Take it all. Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up! - Fill it up!
-Don't mind me. -Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know... I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
- It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow, we ought to go see how Kemmerick is. - That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- We could take his things to him. - Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him, a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
- Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it. - Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
- The kaiser and me--
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it. - No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous. - Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too. They need war.
- And manufacturers. They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular, and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on, - you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up. Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back. - Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
They're robbers here.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no. You must eat.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
I know what you mean!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
- Why didn't they tell me? - Franz!
Franz! - Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See? Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvelous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Good-bye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only- - Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz! Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh- - Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God, this is Franz Kemmerick, only 19 years old.
Please don't let him die.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if... Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Doctor! Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick. Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
Hey! I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat. - Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- lnteresting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
Mueller. I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things, like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Burned to death.
- How was patrol? Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy. I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom, from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know? No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look. My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers, nine dead,
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up! Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss? There is justice in the army!
So, we are all here, huh?
-A bit longer than you, Himmie.
-Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do! There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here. But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly,
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll-- You'll pay for this, you--
There it is.
Right on time. Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No! No!
No! You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
- Aa-aah! - Get up!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward! Forward!
Counterattack.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no. You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me. Say you forgive me.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms, you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can. I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to--
I'll write to your wife.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh- - Look there, for instance.
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
Forward! Forward, march!
Quick there!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men, dismiss!
- Give me your best sausage.
Hey, come on.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on. Give me a beer.
Oh, ho ho! A beer.
One b--
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22. No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes--
- All right. and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
She's a long way from here now.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert, - we might as well wash up anyway.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh! Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing! They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls! Don't go away!
- Please don't go!
Food! Food! Whoo-hoo!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
- What are they jabbering' about?
- They want us to swing over tonight. They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh? What do you mean?
- C'est moi, blondie!
Ooh! She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me. An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Ha-ha! Oh.
I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
They-They said you'd understand.
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
And I wouldn't even know you if I did. And yet, I'll remember you always.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh! For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them. But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet... - around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating,
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us... very well.
I'm sorry, my dear.
Yes, sister.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See? They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient. It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of 'em go in that dying room, but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a hemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad? - No. No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh- - Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
I'm not going! I'm staying here!
- Paul!
Paul! - Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
Sister Libertine, how is he?
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul. Oh, he is... gone.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right. But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur --
Hamacher. Did they cut my leg off?
How many did you have?
You still got 'em!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
And you look fine.
- I won't be a cripple. - Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm. - I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert! - I won't live!
I won't live! - Yes, you will.
Albert! Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody! I've come back! - Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul. Everything will be all right... now.
Oh!
Paul. - What's the matter, Paul?
Paul. Give me your handkerchief.
- Here I am, Paul. Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- No, Mother. I got leave.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself. - Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up. Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit. It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one. - Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honor the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh? Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here. Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
The best for our soldiers.
But... - you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, ehh, let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details, but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honor.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris! Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come. - Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone; from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward, realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland. Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear -eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything. - You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility. Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff, making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's-- Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear -- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
Good night...
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Is this all of it?
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust. Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
Now it's gonna be a real war again. Paul!
How's old Paul?
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
-Which way?
-Down the road about two miles that way.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now. It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul... how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
Ohh... I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on. Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one, and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
That's another one that missed us.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck, huh? - Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
- Aah. - Easy, now.
- Hey!
I'll take you in.
Well, kid... now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
You must do your best tonight, be on your toes, men.
There's an honored guest tonight.
He's one of those men, who are being feted by the smart-set.
We'll see that he gets what he deserves.
Treat him as they do a king, in manner royal.
Like a subject to a king, you must be loyal.
On this object you must have your hearts set.
We'll do nothing to get on his nerves.
Again I mention: Be on your toes, men.
He craves attention, he's one of those men.
Yes sir, We will give him just what he deserves.
Oh, Hives...
- Yes, Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'd like to make a few changes to the assignment of the rooms.
- Very good, Madam.
So, would you put Mr. Chandler in the Blue suite.
and Captain Spalding, as guest of honor, will have the Green duplex with the two baths.
- Two, Madam?
I think the Captain would like two baths, don't you?
Well, if he's just returned from Africa, he may need two baths.
- Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler.
- Mrs. Rittenhouse! Well, I...
- Mr. Chandler!
- The famous Beaugard, as I have promised.
Mr. Chandler, how can I ever express my gratitude?
- Oh, 'tis nothing.
You return from Europe with a masterpiece valued at $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you allow me to unveil it at my party in honour of Captain Spalding.
You call that nothing?
- Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
Will you please remove that to the place where it is to be exhibited.
And very careful, please.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, You think that is something?
It is nothing compared to what I would like to do for you.
You are a very beautiful woman.
- No, no, Mr. Chandler.
Well, maybe I'm wrong. - What?
Please do not go, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
I love you. - I know.
Mr. Chandler, now look...
Hello, Mother.
Playing house?
Well, if you'll pardon me.
Have you seen Johnny Parker?
- I wish you'd get Johnny Parker out of your mind and show more respect to Mr. Chandler.
The trouble with you is you don't take these social affairs seriously.
What would you suggest, Mom?
I would suggest...
That must be him. - Captain Spalding has arrived.
I'm so glad.
My friends, Captain Spalding has arrived.
At last we are to meet him, the famous Captain Spalding.
From climates hot and scalding, the Captain has arrived.
Most heartily we'll greet him, with plain and fancy cheering, until he's hard of hearing.
The Captain has arrived.
Mr. Horatio W. Jamison, Field Secretary of Captain Spalding.
I represent the Captain, who insists on my informing you on these conditions under which he camps here.
In one thing he is very strict. He wants his women young and picked.
As for men, he won't have any tramps here.
There must be no tramps.
The men must all be very old, the women warm, the champagne cold.
It's under these conditions that he camps here.
I'm announcing Captain Jeffrey Spalding.
He's announcing Captain Jeffrey Spalding.
Oh dear. He is coming.
At last he's here.
Well, what do I owe you?
What, from Africa to here, $1.85?
That's an outrage!
I told you not to take me through Australia.
You know it's all ripped up. You shoulda come right up to Lincoln Boulevard. Where do you cover that stuff?
Turn around the rear end.
I want to see your license plates.
I'll attend to you later. Don't try to pull that..
- Captain Spalding
Why, you're one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen and that's not saying much for you.
Captain Spalding, Rittenhouse Manor is entirely at your disposal.
Well, I'm certainly grateful for this magnificent washout, ah, turnout.
Now I'd like to say a few words.
Hello, I must be going.
I cannot stay. I came to say I must be going.
I'm glad I came, but just the same, I must be going.
But my friend, you must stay.
If you should go away, you'll spoil this party I am throwing.
I'll stay a week or two, I'll stay the summer through, but I am telling you,
I must be going.
Before you go, will you oblige us and tell us of your deeds so glowing?
I'll do anything you say.
In fact I'll even stay. - Good.
But I must be going.
There's something that I'd like to say that he's too modest to relay.
The Captain is a moral man. Sometimes he finds it trying.
This fact I'll emphasize with stress.
I never take a drink unless... somebody's buying.
The Captain is a very moral man.
If he hears anything obscene, he'll naturally repel it.
I hate a dirty joke, I do, unless it's told by someone who knows how to tell it.
The Captain is a very moral man.
Hooray for Captain Spalding, the African explorer.
Did someone call me Shnorrer?
Hooray, hooray, hooray!
He went into the jungle, where all the monkeys throw nuts.
If I stay here, I'll go nuts.
He puts all his reliance in courage and defiance and risks his life for science.
Hey hey! He is the only white man to cover every acre.
Hooray, hooray, hooray!
Hey hey! Hooray for Captain Spalding, the African explorer.
He put his name on dying fame and that is why we say:
Hooray, hooray, hooray.
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this magnificent display of effusion
And I want you to know that...
And I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spalding...
Well, somebody's got to do it.
Captain Spalding, it is indeed a great honor to welcome you to my poor home.
Oh, it isn't so bad.
- Needless to say, I...
- Wait a minute, I think you're right, it is pretty bad.
As a matter of fact, it's one of the frowziest-looking joints I've ever seen.
Why Captain.
Where did you get your wallpaper? Well, I...
You're letting this place run down and what's the result, you're not getting the class of people that you used to.
Why, you've got people here now that look like you.
Now I'll tell you what we do, we put up a sign outside,
"Place Under New Management" We'd set up a 75¢ meal that'd knock their eyes out.
After we knock their eyes out, we can charge 'em anything we want.
Now, sign here and give me your check for fifteen-hundred dollars.
Now, Madam, I feel that the time has come, the walrus said... Captain Spalding!
To speak of ma... Captain Spalding, you stand before me as one of the bravest men of all times.
Alright, I'll do that.
In the dark forests of Africa, there has been no danger you have not dared.
You mind if I don't smoke?
Fearlessly you have blazed new trails, scoffed at the lions' roar and the cannibals' tom-tom.
Says you.
Never once in all those weary months did your footsteps falter.
Cowardice is unknown to you.
Fear is not in you.
Pardon me, a caterpillar, Captain.
The caterpillar must have frightened him.
Oh dear.
Yes, well just don't stand there, get the whiskey, get the whiskey!
Where is the whiskey?
- In my little black bag, in the right-hand corner.
Signor Emanuel Ravelli.
- How are you? - Where's the dining room?
- This is a surprise.
Say, I used to know a fella who looked exactly like you by the name of Emanuel Ravelli.
Are you his brother?
I am Emanuel Ravelli. - You're Emanuel Ravelli?
- I am Emanuel Ravelli.
- Well, no wonder you look like him. But I still insist there is a resemblance.
- Eh, he thinks I look alike.
- Well, if you do, it's a tough break for both of you.
You are one of the musicians? But you were not due until tomorrow.
- Couldn't come tomorrow, that's too quick.
- You're lucky they didn't come yesterday. - We were busy yesterday but we charge just the same.
This is better than exploring!
What do you fellas get an hour? For playing, we get $10 an hour.
- I see.
What do you get for not playing?
- $12 an hour. Well, clip me off a piece of that.
Now, for rehearsing, we make special rate.
That's $15 an hour. For rehearsing?
- That's right for rehearsing.
And what do you get for not rehearsing? - You couldn't afford it.
You see, if we don't rehearse, we don't play.
And if we don't play, that runs into money.
How much would you want to run into an open manhole?
- Just a cover charge.
Well, drop in some time.
- Sewer.
Well, we cleaned that up pretty well.
- Well, let's see how we stand.
Flat-footed.
Yesterday we didn't come.
You remember? Yesterday we didn't come?
Oh, I remember.
Yeah, that's $300.
Yesterday you didn't come. That's $300?
- That's $300 Well, that's reasonable.
I can see that alright.
Now, today we did come.
That's uh... That's a hundred you owe us.
Hey, I bet I'm gonna lose on the deal.
Tomorrow we leave.
That's worth about...
- A million dollars.
Yeah, that's alright for me, but I got a partner.
The Professor.
The gates swung open and a Fig Newton entered.
Goodness.
You haven't got chocolate, have you?
He's got everything.
- Hives, take the Professor's hat and coat.
And send for the fumigators.
Say, don't you see there are ladies present?
What do you think this is, a...
Put that hat down, will you.
What are you doing here?
Get out of here. Go on.
A little more to the right.
Now, see that the drape is well-hung.
The mistress will inspect it before the unveiling.
Hello, Hives. - Mrs. Whitehead!
This is a surprise.
- And how about me? - Miss Grace!
You've grown so in the last year. - You haven't lost any weight, yourself.
No, unfortunately not.
You know, Hives, it seems strange to find you working here instead of in our own home.
Well, after you left for Europe, Mrs. Rittenhouse was good enough to make me an offer.
By the way, Hives, what's the secret about the painting?
No secret.
It's Beaugard's "After the Hunt".
The original?
Where did she get hold of that, do you suppose?
Is it very valuable?
- Is it, it must be worth a fortune.
With this, it looks as if we'd steal the Social Award of the Season to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Well, isn't there something we can do?
- We might shoot ourselves.
I'd rather shoot Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Say, I have an idea.
I copied that painting at art school a year ago. Well, what of it?
But I still don't get it.
I'll go home and get the copy. We'll substitute it for the original and when she unveils it, what'll she have?
An imitation, and I must admit, a very cruel one.
Grace, you're wonderful.
- That's what I've been telling you.
I won't be long.
Do you still feel a bond between us?
- Most certainly, Mrs. Whitehead.
Strong enough for you to do me a big favor?
- Anything at all. Well..
suppose I were to ask you to take away the Beaugard... What, do you mean...
- Oh, just temporarily, of course.
And substitute something of my own?
- Well, I should consider it rather an unusual request.
It is, Hives, but somehow I still think of you as one of the Whiteheads.
You may count on me.
My soul is yours, even though my body may belong to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Why, Hives!
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead! - Arabella!
May I present Mr. Parker?
- Of the Massachusetts' Parkers? Why, no.
- Then the Southern Parkers?
No, the Central Parkers.
You know, the Benches and Trees.
I see.
Meow!
Oh, I don't like that woman. Well, never mind.
You come over here and sit down and tell me whom you do like.
Oh, so that's your game.
- Now listen.
Do you really love me?
- Why don't you marry me and find out?
- Marry you? On what?
Last year I sold two paintings.
One at a hundred and one at fifty.
Could we live on $150 a year?
- We wouldn't need any money.
I've got a charge account in every shop on 5th Avenue.
Well, if I had any brains, I'd give up painting and get a regular job.
You know, I had a cousin who made $50,000 in Wall Street last year.
I don't wanna marry your cousin.
I'm a darn fool.
Say... we could get that old bluff Chandler to buy a portrait from you. Chandler?
What does he know about art?
Well, the less he knows, the easier it'll be for you to sell 'em.
They're right upstairs.
Go round the other side.
Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Captain Spalding! How are you?
Tell me.
Are you alone?
- Captain, I don't understand.
What, you don't understand being alone?
Don't give me that innocent stuff or you'll be alone.
A big cluck like you turning cute on me!
Mrs. Rittenhouse... - Yes?
Oh, pardon me.
You've been affected like this yourself, haven't you at times?
Oh no, Captain.
- Well, you will be.
Mrs. Rittenhouse... Ever since I've met you, I've swept you off my feet.
Something has been throbbing within me.
Oh it's been beating like the incessant tom-tom in the primitive jungle.
Something that I must ask you. - What is it, Captain?
Would you wash out a pair of socks for me?
- Captain, I'm surprised.
Well it may be a surprise to you but it's been on my mind for weeks.
It's just my way of telling you that I love you, that's all. I love you.
- Captain, Mrs. Whitehead!
- I've never been...
Am I intruding?
Are you intruding?
Just when I had her on the 5-yard line.
I should say you were intruding.
I should say you are intruding, pardon me.
I was using the subjunctive instead of the past tense.
Yes, we're way past tents, we're living in bungalows now.
This is the mechanical age, of course.
Mrs. Whitehead, you haven't met Captain Spalding, have you?
Why, no, I haven't
How are you? - How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?
And how are you?
That leaves you one up.
Did anyone ever tell you you had beautiful eyes? - No
Well, you have. And so have you.
He shot her a glance.
As a smile played around his lips.
Yes, I don't think I've never seen four more beautiful eyes in my life.
Well, three anyway.
You know, You two girls have everything.
You're tall and short, and slim and stout and blonde and brunette.
And that's just the kind of a girl I crave.
We three would make an ideal couple.
Why, you've got beauty, charm, money.
You have got money, haven't you?
Because if you haven't, we can quit right now.
The Captain is charming, isn't he?
- I'm fascinated.
I'm fascinated, too--right on the arm.
Fascinated, whim-wham!
If I were Eugene O'Neill, I could tell you what I really think of you two.
You know, you're very fortunate the Theater Guild isn't putting this on. And so is the Guild.
Pardon me while I have a strange interlude.
Why you couple of baboons, what makes you think I'd marry either one of you?
Strange how the wind blows tonight.
It has a thin eery voice. Reminds me of poor old Marsden.
How happy I could be with either of these two, if both of them just went away.
Well, what do you say, girls, will you marry me?
But Captain, which one of us?
Let's all get married.
Party... Party...
Here I am talking of parties.
I came down here for a party.
Not even ice cream.
The gods look down and laugh.
This would be a better world for children if the parents had to eat the spinach.
Well what do you say, girls?
What do you say, are we all gonna get married?
- All of us.
But that's bigamy.
- Yes, and that's big of me, too.
It's big of all of us. Let's be big for a change.
I'm sick of these conventional marriages.
One woman and one man was good enough for your grandmother, but who wants to marry your grandmother?
Not even your grandfather.
Think of the honeymoon--strictly private:
I wouldn't let another woman in on this.
Well, maybe one or two, but no men.
I may not go myself.
Are you suggesting Companionate Marriage?
Well, It's got its advantages.
And you, you could sell Fuller brushes. Living with your folks...
Strange figures. Weird figures: Steel 186, Anaconda 74,
American Can 138.
Let's see where were we?
Oh yes, we were about to get married.
Do you think we really ought to get married?
- I think marriage is a very noble institution.
It's the foundation of the American home.
I've been waiting at the bottom these stairs for years for just such a moment as this.
Why Captain, where are you going?
- I'm sorry, ladies, but I'm afraid we're gonna have to postpone the wedding for a few days.
Before I get married, I'm gonna sow a couple of wild oats.
The Captain's so amusing.
- Isn't he charming?
So that's the famous Beaugard, eh?
It's a great picture, isn't it? Oh you've seen it before?
- Seen it, I spent 3 days in Paris copying it.
- Well, me and a million other young artists.
I bet your copy was better than any of them.
- Well, it wasn't bad at that.
I'll show it to you sometime.
- Mother's going to unveil it tonight. Yeah?
Suppose...
Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all.
Suppose it's yours.
- You mean, put my copy in place of the Beaugard?
- Why Arabella, you're crazy. What good would that do?
What good?
They'll unveil it.
Chandler will tell everybody how fine it is.
They'll all cheer their heads off, and then we'll tell 'em who really painted it.
They'll say you're a great artist.
You'll get 6 commissions for painting, and we can be married and divorced in no time.
But what if they don't like my painting? What then?
Well, isn't the chance worth taking?
I see you're admiring my picture, eh?
Your picture?
- Yes, my picture.
- Well, it don't look like you.
Hey wait, some place I met you before.
because your face is very familiar.
Well, after all, I am one of the most well-known men in America.
The newspapers will keep running my photograph.
You're not Abe Kabibble?
- Nonsense
Alright, hey wait, if you're not Abe Kabibble, who are you?
Now please, Chandler is my name.
Roscoe W. Chandler.
Yeah, but I don't get about the name, you see.
Some place I met you before because your face is very familiar.
Now wait, let me see, were you ever in Sing Sing?
- Please. No I got it.
Joliet!
- Let me alone.
Alright, alright.
Don't run away, don't run away
Leavenworth! Now, listen here.
I have never been in these places.
I've spent most of my time in Europe.
I've got it now.
I know, you come from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you.
I have never been there. - Hey, come here.
- I tell you this... Please! Get him away from me, would you.
You remember him.
He come from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you.
I told you before, you are mistaken.
He come from Czechoslovakia. And I know who it is.
That's Abie, the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia.
- Ridiculous, I tell you.
You're wrong!
We prove it.
He had a birthmark, remember?
Please, what are you trying?
Let me alone!
There it is!
There's the birthmark!
Abie, the fishman.
I was Abie, the peddler.
Well, how did you get to be Roscoe W. Chandler?
- Say, how did you get to be an Italian? Never mind.
Whose confession is this?
Well now, here, boys, for heaven's sake don't say anything about this to anybody and I think we can come to some agreement.
Some arrangement which will be, uh, mutually satisfactory, yes?
Money. Money.
- Shall we say $500?
Fie to $500!
- Well, that is all the cash I have with me.
Well alright, I tell you what we do.
We'll take your IOU.
I have given you my best offer and that is all you will get.
- That's all you'll give, eh?
Abie the fishman! Abie the fishman!
Please, be quiet.
Please, come here.
Now listen here, I have here a check for $5,000.
Now I give it to you
- Hey, is it good?
- Well of course it is good.
Who would give me a bad check? I would.
See if it's good.
Alright, if you don't want the check then that is all you will get.
- That's all we get? - Yes.
- He's Abie the fishman!
- Please be quiet, please!
Here, give me that handkerchief.
My tie!
Nothing but a pair of thieves.
I get the tie.
The birthmark!
Hey, hey, where's your tie?
- Well, I...
That's a fine way for a millionaire to be running around, open at the neck.
Have you got garters?
- Of course I have garters.
Oh, they've taken my garters too.
A likely story.
Turning collegian on me, eh?
Have you got socks?
- So you have, you have got socks.
They look pretty old to me too.
Whose are they?
Well, old socks. Let me introduce myself.
My name is Spalding, Captain Spalding.
- I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
- Well, this is a treat, your treat.
You have heard about me?
Yes, I've heard about you for a great many years, Mr Chandler, and I'm getting pretty darn sick of it too.
Quite naturally, I've also heard of the great Captain Spalding.
I've heard of you and you've heard of me.
Now, have you ever heard the one about the two Irishmen?
Well, now that I've got you in hysterics, let's get down to business.
- I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
- I am Jeffrey T. Spalding.
I'll bet you don't know what the "T" stand for. Thomas?
- Edgar.
You were close, though.
You were close though and you still are, I'll bet. Now, this is what I want to talk to you about, Mr Chandler:
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
- Well, that is a question.
Yes, that is a question, you certainly know a question when you see it.
I congratulate you, Mr Chandler. And that brings us right back to where we were.
Well, is there any particular kind of an expedition you've had in mind?
Well, I'll tell you, I'm getting along in years now and there's one thing that I've always wanted to do before I quit.
Retire.
Now, would you be interested in a proposition of that kind?
You know, I've always had an idea that my retirement would be the greatest contribution to science that the world has ever known.
This is your chance, Mr Chandler. When I think what you have done for this country.
And by the way, what have you done for this country?
- Oh well... I've always tried to do what I could. Especially in the world of art.
Art, well I don't know how we drifted around to that, but what is your opinion of art?
I am very glad you asked me.
This fella takes things seriously.
It isn't safe to ask him a simple question.
Tell me, Mr Chandler, where are you planning on putting your new opera house?
Oh, I thought I should like to put it somewhere near Central Park.
Why don't you put it right in Central Park?
- Could we do that?
Sure, do it at night, when no one is looking.
Why don't you put it in the reservoir and get the whole thing over with?
Of course, that might interfere with the water supply.
But after all, we must remember that art is art.
Though on the other hand, water is water, isn't it.
And east is east, and west is west.
And if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce, it tastes much more like prunes than rhubarb does.
Now, uh... Now, you tell me what you know.
well, i-i-I would be very glad to give you my opinion.
Well, that's dandy, I'll ask you for them someday.
Remind me, will you? I'll tell you what,
Could you come to my office at ten o'clock tomorrow morning?
If I'm not there, ask for Mr Jameson, that's my secretary.
And if he sees you, I'll discharge him.
That's a date now, Saturday at three. No, you'd better make it Tuesday.
I'm going to Europe Monday.
Pardon me, My name is Spalding
Heck, I've always wanted to meet you, Mr Chandler.
Tell me, what do you think of the traffic problems?
What do you think of the marriage problems?
What do you think of at night, when you go to bed, you beast?
- Well, I'll tell you my...
- I'd rather not discuss it any further.
Remember, there are children present.
Well, you see, my dear Captain, in the last analysis, it is a question of money.
The nickel today is not what it used to be ten years ago.
I'll go further than that.
I'll get off at the depot. The nickel today is not what it was 15 years ago.
You know what this country needs today? - What?
- A seven-cent nickel.
Yessiree, we've been using the five-cen'nick on this country since 1492.
Now, that's putting you near a hundred years, daylight savings.
Now, why not give the seven-cent nickel a chance.
If that works out, next year we could have an eight-cent nickel. Think what that would mean.
You could go to a news stand, buy a three-cent newspaper and get the same nickel back again.
One nickel carefully used would last a family a lifetime.
Captain Spalding, I think that is a wonderful idea.
- You do, eh?
- Yes. Well, then there can't be much to it.
Well, tell me, Captain Chandler... Excuse me, Spalding.
- Spalding, that's right.
I'm Spalding and you're Chandler.
Let's have no more of that either, eh.
Alright. - Bad enough being Spalding.
- Well, tell me, Captain Spalding... Spalding is the right name?
- That's right, that's right.
I'm Chand...
No, I'm Spald... Could I look at a program in a minute?
I might be the news weekly for all he knows, or coming next week.
Well, tell me, Captain Spalding, you've been quite a traveler.
What do you think about South America?
I'm going there soon, you know.
Is that so? Where are you going?
- Uruguay.
Well, you go your-a-guay, and I'll go mine.
Say, how long has this been going on?
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.
I'll tell you, you take Abyssinia and I'll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye bread.
Let's go and see what the boys in the back room are up to.
Let's see how yours compares with the original.
I don't see any difference!
- Well, look closer.
Maybe you'll find it's better.
You seen my partner?
Oh, Mr. Raviola!
Ravelli.
Ravelli. - Oh, Mr. Ravelli.
I'd do anything for you.
What do ya want I should do?
You see that painting?
- You mean this piksh?
I want you to take that out of the frame and put this one in its place.
You want I should take this one down put this one upstairs, huh?
- Yes. You want I should steal?
- Oh no, no, It's not stealing.
Well, then I couldn't do it.
- Oh, Mr. Raviola!
That's all you do. Chase the women.
Oh, stop.
Everybody here plays cards, they don't ask us.
Here we are to waste all our time.
We've been here all day, eh.
How much we make?
We make nothing.
First thing you know, we're gonna live on a charity then we go to the old ladies' home.
How do you like that?
No, that's no good.
These people here all got money.
Now, we gotta find someone to play with us, see.
I'd play anything.
Poker, pinochle... - Signor Ravelli,
I want to talk to you about the music.
What in the world's the matter with you?
It would be nice if...
Go away from me! What is this?
- It's alright, just a...
Hello, Professor.
Good heavens, what's the matter with his feet?
We play all kinds of games.
Blackjack, soccer...
What is the matter with your leg?
Atta boy. Get up, buddy.
Yeah, she can't take it there.
Well, why don't you leave him alone?
Now that this game is over, how about playing some bridge?
You play bridge?
- I play bridge a little.
- What do you play for?
Oh we just play for small stakes.
- And french-fried potatoes?
Set it up right over there, Hives.
Chandler, now where is he off to?
Take it away, Hives.
How do you want to play?
Honest?
- I hope so.
You put that right away.
Come along now, we'll cut for partners.
- No, he's my partner.
That's the only way we play.
I'm sorry but it's against the rules of the game. We have to cut for partners.
Alright, we cut for partners.
I got ace of spades.
He's got ace of spades.
That's what you call coincidences!
Two aces of spades?
- Yeah, he's got thousands of them.
Well I suppose that gives him the choice of seat.
- You have the choice of seat.
Good heavens!
Not on her lap.
- He thought it was contact bridge.
Just a minute, now.
Shuffle the cards.
- Yeah, you gotta scrumble 'em up a little bit, you know.
I'd like to cut those cards.
That's a winner.
Your bid, partner.
You pass?
Misdeal.
You pass?
I bid one spade.
I pass.
- Three spades.
Four spades.
- I don't understand this kind of bidding.
Well, you don't have to.
You bid four spades, eh?
Why, I haven't a spade in my hand.
- Alright. We double.
I want you to go over the bidding.
Oh, hey, she wants to start 'em off again, the bid.
He bids one.
- That's alright.
You'll find out.
But we have to know what he's bidding.
- We tell you later. Now I bid two.
Two what?
- Two of the same he bids.
Now the bidding's over, see.
That's enough bidding.
It's your lead.
Oh no, you can't lead that.
Why, we can't take it.
- Well, what should I lead? He'll show you.
Ace of spades.
That's-a very good.
Three of spades. Four of spades.
You trump it?
That's what you call finesse.
No spades, partner.
No spades.
Dummy leads.
The dummy leads.
I'm not the dummy.
- Well, you could be.
Hundred aces, eh?
Make a big slam.
Make a big, big slam.
That's a good guy.
Plays a good game.
Plays a fine game.
Ace of spades.
- I refuse to play any longer.
You're nothing but a couple of cardsharps.
What's the matter, dear?
- My shoes are gone.
Good gracious, he has your slippers.
Hey, you take-a the ladies' shoes, eh?
Quiet!
Hide.
Somebody's coming.
Alright, I make a mistake.
Get up, come on.
Hey, hurry up.
You know what we to do, eh?
We gotta take that picture and put this one upstairs, for the lady.
Wait, no touch.
You got everything ready?
Shovel, axe, dynamite, pineapples?
That's-a no flash. A flash.
Here's a flash.
That's a fish!
I no want the fish.
No fish. Flash!
Stop it.
You crazy.
When you go out in the night time, you gotta have the flash.
That's no flash. That's a flisk.
Flash.
When you wanna see somebody, you gotta have the flash.
That's a flush.
What I gonna do with a flush?
A flash.
That's a flitz.
What I gonna do with flitz?
That's a whaddaya-call a flutz.
All you got is a fish and a flutz and a flitz and a flutz...
Stop this.
Where's the flash?
Look, when everything's light and you wanna make 'em dark. What ya do?
Hey, you crazy.
I want no blackjack.
My mistake, I guess.
When everything's dark and you wanna make 'em light.
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a flash.
Hey, that's good, alright.
The storm put the lights out.
Now nobody can see what we do.
That's-a fine, eh?
I no want the fish. Flash.
No, no flutz.
What's-a matter for you, eh? Flash.
Before the people are coming.
What's a matter?
You lose it?
You gotta find it.
Look for it.
Alright, never mind.
We'll work without it.
Hide!
Somebody's coming. Hide.
Quiet, quiet.
Shut up.
Oh, Captain Spalding, where are you?
- Yeah?
Oh, Captain...
- Yes, what's the trouble?
The storm has put the lights out and you can't see your hand before your face.
Well, you wouldn't get much enjoyment out of that.
Well, I don't know what you're gonna do but I'm gonna take a nap.
Leave me a call for three o'clock.
Make it three-thirty.
You certainly get service around here.
Pardon me, Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose a fish?
Well, somebody lost it.
Will you take it out to the kitchen and have it fried for me?
There's somebody over there.
I say, there's somebody over there.
- Don't be silly, the house is just settling, that's all.
Anybody over there?
If there was anybody over there, he'd see him, wouldn't I?
What is it, Captain?
What is it? You know what I think?
I think you got roaches.
Yes, you've got roaches alright.
And the biggest one has got asthma. Horrible!
Come on, Captain.
Let us get out of here.
Hey, we get the picture and we don't make a one sound.
Hey, somebody turned on the lights.
Alright, we get the picture though we may no make a one sound.
C'mon, let's go, get outta here.
Oh, the fish.
Hey, that's some storm, eh?
A regular tornado.
C'mon, let's go this way.
I think it's a shortcut.
Come on, let's go.
California.
And now, my friends, before we start the musical program, Captain Spalding has kindly considered to tell us about his trip to Africa.
Captain Spalding.
Friends, I'm going to tell you of that great, mysterious, wonderful continent known as Africa.
Africa is God's country, and he can have it.
Well sir, we left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2nd.
After 15 days on the water and 6 on the boat, we finally arrived on the shores of Africa.
We at once proceeded three-hundred miles into the heart of the jungle, where I shot a polar bear.
This bear was 6' 7" in its stockinged feet, and had shoes on him.
- Pardon me, just a moment, Captain.
I always thought that polar bears lived in the frozen north. Oh you did?
Well this bear was anemic and he couldn't stand the cold climate.
He was a rich bear and he could afford to go away in the winter.
You take care of your animals, and I'll take care of mine.
Frozen north, my eye!
From the day of our arrival, we led an active life.
The first morning saw us up at 6, breakfasted and back in bed at 7.
This was our routine for the first three months.
We finally got so we were back in bed at 6:30.
One morning I was sitting in front of the cabin, smoking some meat...
Smoking some meat?
- Yes, there wasn't a cigar store in the neighborhood.
As I say, I was sitting in front of the cabin, when I bagged 6 tigers.
Captain. Did you catch 6 tigers?
I bagged 'em, I.. I begged 'em to go away, but they hung around all afternoon.
They were the most persistent tigers I've ever seen.
The principal animals inhabiting the African jungle are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias.
You all know what a moose is.
The first day I shot two bucks.
That was the biggest game we had
As I say, you all know what a moose is.
A moose runs around on the floor and eats cheese and is chased by cats.
The elks, on the other hand, live up in the hills, and in the spring they come down for their annual convention.
It is very interesting to watch them come to the waterhole.
And you should see them run when they find out it's only a waterhole.
What they're looking for is an alco-hole.
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
Then we tried to remove the tusks.
The tusks.
That's not so easy to say, tusks.
You can try that some time. Oh, simple.
Tusks.
Pardon me, my name is Spalding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
As I say, we tried to remove the tusks, but they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't budge them.
Of course, in Alabama, the tusks are looser.
But that's entirely ir-elephant to what I was talking about.
We took pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.
But we're going back again in a couple of weeks and we...
- Very enlightening speech, Captain.
- Hooray for Captain Spalding.
Three cheers for Captain Spalding!
Three cheers for Captain Spalding!
Three cheers...
- No one asked for the chairs.
Put them right where you got them. Go on.
Go on with your chairs.
Go on, go on, you!
And now, friends, Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano.
Signor Ravelli.
Signor Ravelli's first selection will be "Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping"
with a male chorus.
Say, if you get near a song, play it.
I can't think of the finish.
And I can't think of anything else.
You know what I think, I think I went past it.
Well if you come around again, jump off.
I once kept this up for three days.
You wouldn't consider hush money, would you?
I can't get 'em now.
I've gotta wait for inspiration.
- It's about time. Play the song about Montreal.
- Montreal?
"I'm A Dreamer, Montreal."
I dunno that. I tell you what I'll do,
I'll play one of my own compositions, by Victor Herbert.
Make it short.
He plays them both well.
Your team scored that time.
So did the old blue one.
Why do you push, huh?
Why do you push?
- Let 'em alone, they may exterminate each other.
The best thing to have for either of them.
And once for old Purdue.
Hey, I thought I had the finish.
- I wish you did.
Yours. Play the song about the Irish chiropodist.
- Irish chiropodist?
- "My Fate Is In Your Hands".
Is there a horse in the house?
They got everything else here.
And now, Mrs. Rittenrotten... Rittenhouse.
- Yes, a slight error.
I have a surprise for you.
The man is here for the piano.
- Oh, Captain!
- Oh how wonderful.
Well now, don't be too hasty. Wait'll you see.
- I can't wait...
The whole thing was done with the white of an egg.
Well, what is it, Captain? What is it?
What is it, you ask?
This is a hope chest for a guinea pig.
"What is it." This magnificent chest... No, this mag..
No, this magnificent chest I now take great pleasure in presenting to you with my compliments.
- Captain, this leaves me speechless.
Well, see that you remain that way.
- And now, ladies and gentlemen...
Come outside and say that.
If we will all adjourn to the library,
Mrs. Rittenhouse has another and perhaps a greater surprise for us.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, how do you pay Hives?
By the week or by the pound?
And now it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of François Jacques DuBois Gilbert Beaugard.
No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot.
"After the Hunt."
I told you, you were a great artist.
Shall we spill the beans now?
- Let's wait a minute. Something might happen.
I'm sure we'd all appreciate a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us something of the life and work of the artist Beaugard
And keep it clean!
Mr. Chandler!
My friends, I am quite sure that you are all familiar with Beaugard. And this is perhaps his masterpiece.
In it he has achieved a greatness in the handling of color and line.
Now you will see here that... Wait!
This is not my picture.
This is a rank imitation.
You are right. It is not the Beaugard.
- It certainly isn't.
There's a dog missing.
Oh Captain Spalding, what shall I do?
- Telephone the dog-catchers immediately.
They've taken the original and left me this.
- Leave it to me. I'll throw some light on this subject.
Has anyone a match?
- What happened?
Oh Hives, where are you?
Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose that fish again?
- Oh Captain, I'm so worried.
Good heavens.
That one is gone, too.
- Oh, this is awful.
The crooks, they are escaping.
Never mind the men, just the women!
Right this way.
They went out here.
I never saw anything so funny in all my life.
This is great.
And there goes her old party.
Good old Hives.
Wasn't it funny? - Oh, v-v-v-very.
You're not afraid, are you, Hives?
- Oh no. I'm not afraid. Oh dear, no.
Only, you see, well, they were talking of having the police here and I wouldn't want the police suspect me.
Why, they wouldn't suspect you.
- Oh yes, they would!
See, the last time they suspected me, I got four years. - Hives!
Alright, Hives, give me the painting, and I'll take care of it.
It's gone.
- Gone?
- I left it in there.
There must be thieves at this party.
If I'd known that, I never would have come.
That professor!
- The Professor!
Hives, that's the fella who would plan it.
Now listen, we've got to get that picture away from him.
Might I suggest some of this?
Very satisfactory in these cases.
A few drops on a handkerchief and the Professor will no longer obstruct us.
You're sure it'll do the trick?
Would you care to try some?
No thanks, Hives.
Let's find the Professor.
I don't see how the thieves could've gotten away or who it could've been.
It's a good thing we substituted yours.
Suppose the thieves had gotten away with the Beaugard.
Oh, and it'd be alright if they stole mine?
Oh Darling, I didn't mean that.
But what would Mother do?
Why, it's worth $100,000.
How could she have replaced it?
Just think, whoever took it was right in the room with us.
Just like Raffles!
All the boys I've known used to say I was made of stone.
I would always leave them alone in despair.
I've been on the pan, I've been called an electric fan, told I'm even much colder than Frigidaire.
I began to wonder if I was all wrong.
I thought so till you came along.
Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic?
When you're near, why am I so romantic?
What a grand feeling, when your lips meet mine.
That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine.
I don't know what it is you've done to me.
You don't know half of the good you do me.
Other boys bore me, they just leave me blue.
Oh, why am I so romantic with you?
Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic?
When you're near, why am I so romantic?
What a grand feeling, when your lips touch mine.
When we touch, close in your arms you hold me.
I forget all that my mother told me.
Other girls bore me, they just leave me blue.
But why am I so romantic with you?
Oh, Signor Ravelli!
I've been looking for you all morning.
I was busy all morning.
- Signor Ravelli, you've gotta put that painting back.
Painting?
The one you changed last night.
Oh, you mean the piksh?
- Yes. Hey, what's-a matter for you? First you want 'em downstairs, then you want 'em upstairs, then you want 'em a downstairs, then you..
C'mon, Make up your mind.
Oh I do thank you for what you've done but you've gotta get that painting back before the police get here.
The police are coming?
- Yes.
- Wait, I give it to you.
You put it back.
Where's the piksh?
- What do you mean 'Where's the piksh?
' I put 'em in here.
It's gone.
Somebody take 'em.
You take 'em!
- Me? No, I know, I know.
The fish peddler. Abie the fish peddler.
Did Mother invite a fish peddler here?
I don't know, but he's here.
Come on, we find him.
Good morning, Mrs Rittenhouse.
- Good morning, Mr. Jamison.
And how is Captain Spalding this morning?
- Oh he had a very bad night.
He didn't sleep a wink.
He went on horseback riding in the middle of the night.
- But we've all been pretty upset.
Did you enjoy your ride?
- I lost my horse.
Yes, he slipped right out from between me.
I had my feet in the stirrups, too.
I dunno, I dunno how he got awa- I didn't care about that but I lost the bit you loaned me.
Nevermind, I'll get you another bit.
- Well, that'll be two bits I owe you then.
Captain, I hope you weren't distressed by last night's unfortunate occurrence.
You mean that dinner you served?
- No, the painting that was stolen!
Was there a painting stolen?
I haven't seen a painting in three weeks.
Jamison! As my secretary, why didn't you inform me there was a painting stolen?
What do you think I engaged you for?
Well Captain, I didn't know it.
- Well, you should've asked me.
- You're sorry?
You're a contemptible cur!
I repeat, sir. You're a contemptible cur.
Oh if I were a man, you'd resent that.
Please keep quiet, will you?
I can get along without you, you know.
I got along without your father, didn't I?
Yes, and your grandfather.
Yes, and your uncle.
Yes, and your uncle.
Yes, and my uncle.
- Captain! - I didn't come here to be exonerated.
- I beg pardon Mrs. Rittenhouse..
Oh you do, eh?
Well, I'd like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat.
The police are here, madam.
- Oh, the police.
Have them come in.
Oh, so that's your game, is it.
Well, you can't shut me up! - Captain!
No, you can talk to my attorney.
Jamison, take a letter to my lawyers.
I'll show you a thing or two.
Show you a thing or three. - Oh Captain.
- Sending for the police!
Take a letter to my lawyers.
Sending for the police, eh?
I say, take a letter to my lawyers.
- I am taking it. Well, read me what you have so far.
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, care of Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga McCormack.
Semicolon.
How do you spell "semicolon"?
- Alright, make it a comma.
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, Hungadunga... McCormack.
Gentlemen, question mark.
Do you want "er-r-r" in the letter?
- No, put that in an envelope.
Now then...
Quotes, unquotes and quotes.
Hoping this finds you, I beg to remain...
- Hoping this finds him where?
Well let him worry about that.
Don't be so inquisitive, Jamison.
Sneak!
I say, hoping this finds you, I beg to remain as of June 9th.
Cordially, yours, regards.
That's all, Jamison. I'll show you where I get off.
Sending for the police.
Vow read me the letter, Jamison.
- Hungadunga
That's it, Hungadunga.
"C/ o Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga McCormack."
You've left out a Hungadunga.
You left out the main one, too.
Thought you could slip one over on me, didn't you, eh?
Alright, leave it out and put in a windshield wiper instead.
I tell you what you do, Jamison.
I tell you what. Make it three windshield wipers and one Hungadunga.
They won't all be there when the letter arrives anyhow.
"...and McCormack. Gentlemen, question mark."
- Gentlemen, question mark?
Put it on the penultimate and not on the dipthonic.
You want to brush up on your Greek, Jamison.
Well, get a Greek and brush up on him.
"In re yours of the 5 inst."
- I see. Now, uh... you said a lot of things here that I didn't think were important, so I just omitted them.
Oh Captain!
Good gracious.
So, you just omitted them, eh?
You just omitted the body of the letter, that's all.
You just left out the body of the letter, that's all.
Yours is not to reason why, Jamison.
You've left out the body of the letter.
Alright, send it that way and tell him the body will follow.
You want the body in brackets?
No, it'll never get there in brackets.
Put it in a box. Put it in a box and mark it 'fragilly'.
Mark it what?
- 'Fragilly! ' F-R-A-G...
Look it up, Jamison, it's in the dictionary.
Look under fragile. Look under the table if you don't find it there.
"Quotes, unquotes and quotes."
- That's three quotes?
- Yes, sir. Add another quart and make it a gallon.
How much is in a gallon, Jamison?
Regards.
- Regards, that's a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic. That's dandy.
Now, I want you to make two carbon copies of that letter and throw the original away.
And when you get through with that, throw the carbon copies away.
Just send a stamp. Air mail.
That's all.
You may go, Jamison. I may go too.
- Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'm Inspector Hennessey from headquarters.
- How do you do, Inspector?
Let me introduce myself. I'm Captain Scotland of Spalding Yard.
No, I'm Captain Spalding of Scotland Yard.
Please don't make the same mistake again.
- I'm glad to know you, Captain.
- Well, I should think you would be.
Now then, Inspector, I think between the two of us, we can solve the mystery of the stolen painting, especially if you go home.
Inspector, please don't be too hasty about making an arrest.
I don't want my guests embarrassed.
Don't worry, we won't arrest anybody.
- He's lucky if he can stay out of jail himself.
Mr. Jamison, would you mind taking the Inspector and his men to the library and showing them the scene of the crime.
Certainly, Mrs Rittenhouse. Right this way, Inspector.
And Jamison, count the spoons.
Captain, I didn't know you'd been a detective too.
- There's a whole lot of things you don't know.
- I suppose that's so.
- You know darn well it's so.
Where were you on the night of June 5th, 1774?
I'm afraid I don't know.
- You betcha don't know.
Where was I? I don't know.
- Well, I don't know either and if I did know, I wouldn't tell you.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Take a number from 1 to 10.
Alright, what's the number?
- 7.
- That's right. 7 is right.
I coulda done it with one hand if I wanted to.
This is no mystery. I could solve this in 5 minutes if I wanted to worry.
Captain, I don't want you to worry.
I don't want anything to interfere with your weekend.
Nothing ever interferes with my weak end. And I'll thank you not to get personal, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
- Oh Captain! Where's my secretary?
Jamison! - Captain, I assure you, I didn't mean to offend you.
Oh please, Captain, you misunderstood me.
A more dastardly cracker I've never heard!
I wish I was back in the jungle where men are monkeys.
Captain, I'm so sorry.
- Jamison!
No, no.
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
- Good morning. Perfectly charming party.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
It's just full of surprises.
- So glad you're enjoying yourself.
Oh Hives, Hives!
Good morning.
Some breakfast? - Breakfast nothing.
Did you get the painting?
- No, I did not. I watched all night, but the Professor did not sleep in his room.
Strange, very strange.
- Good heavens, Hives.
What will we do? I don't know. Until we see the Professor...
You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle.
Don't worry, he'll not get away from me this time.
Did you get it?
- Yes, madam.
- Good. Now I'll go ahead and engage him in conversation.
You trail behind and when the proper time comes, see that he gets it.
Oh hello.
I've been looking all over for you!
What is the matter with this?
What've you got there, the morning papers?
No, that isn't the one I want.
Let me see one of the others. That still isn't the one I want.
Out!
Yes, out!
The birds...
Come on up here and sit down.
Well, I like you.
I like little boys like you.
By the way, how old are you? Five years old?
Why, you're just a baby, aren't you?
Oh, isn't that nice?
Now all joking aside, isn't there someone you do like?
Isn't there someone you love? Now think again.
Isn't there someone you really and truly love?
Is there?
Tell me who!
Why, that's a horse!
You love a horse?
Come on, lift him up.
He's out.
- Let us get out.
Arabella!
- John, I've been trying to find you.
Ravelli has lost the painting.
Well I've been looking all over for you I just found a painting out on the terrace.
Was it the Beaugard?
- No - Oh, yours?
Well if it's not yours, and it's not the Beaugard, whose is it?
Someone else came along and substituted it for mine, thinking they were getting away with the original Beaugard.
Somebody swiped my scheme, eh?
Say, then Chandler never saw your painting after all?
For all I know, you may still be a great artist.
Where is this picture?
It's up in my room.
- Well, you go get it and I'll get the Captain Spalding.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
And then John found the third painting.
- Well, that's very interesting.
Well, fairly interesting.
Well, we just gotta keep a sharp look out, that's all.
-Oh I've gotta find it or Mother's out $100,000.
Now, don't worry. Let me work on this case for 24 hours and then we'll call in somebody else.
You think it's a mystery now?
Wait'll you see it tomorrow.
Remember the Charley Ross disappearance?
I worked on that case for 24 hours and they never did find him.
They couldn't find me for five years.
That's me, Captain Yard of Scotland Spalding.
I always get my women, or paintings.
Arabella, can you mention what's happened?
You know that painting I found?
Well, it's been stolen from my room.
There you are! I haven't been on the case five minutes and there's another painting gone.
I bet it's not even five minutes. I'll bet it's not over three.
Now they've got my watch.
This is going too far.
It wasn't going, and now it's gone.
And the door to my room was locked too.
- Well how could they get in?
Who could it have been?
I think I've got a clue.
No, it's a hair, a red hair.
Oh no, it couldn't be.
Well, he's picked out this month by the Crook of the Month club.
Anyhow, we'll investigate it.
You know Conductor Hennessey?
- Inspector!
Inspect her yourself.
Now listen, you know that little redheaded fellow, the Professor?
Well, get that gang of flagpole sitters of yours and see if you can find him.
Aye aye, Captain.
We'll soon get to the bottom of this.
Hey, what's that cop doing there?
It didn't take that long to find him.
- That's right, this is it!
Yeah, this is it, but which one is it?
- The one that was just taken from my room.
Oh, we've got that back.
Maybe I got my watch back.
Now the fob is gone!
Well, I still got the pocket.
Anything I retain now is velvet.
Except the coat.
That's Prince Albert.
Well, all the jokes can't be good.
You've got to expect that once in a while.
Say, if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, well, we'd have a pretty good clue.
I said, if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, we'd have a pretty good clue.
What a dull conversationalist you turned out to be!
Let me see that a minute, will ya.
Say, this is signed "Beaugard".
There's the criminal:
Beaugard.
No Beaugard is dead.
Beaugard is dead?
Then it's murder!
Now we've got something.
What do you got, Cap?
- I've got jacks and aces.
What've you got?
- Look at this, Ravelli. Isn't there something strikes you very funny about this picture?
Come, come, it isn't as funny as all that.
Did you ever see a tree like that?
Tree?
That's a spinach.
- That can't be spinach. Where's the egg?
Well, it could be spinach.
Look at all the sand laying around there.
You mean it's an old Spinach custom? No, it's not that, Ravelli.
Anything but that.
No, Cap, that's alright, it's my mistake.
You know what that is, that's Coleslaw.
Coleslaw? - Yeah. That's-a Coleslaw
Did you ever see a coleslaw like that?
- Sure, look at this one.
I don't want any of your lip now.
Did you ever see anything like that?
You know what this is? This is a left-handed painting.
Look, there's a signature.
- That's right, it's in the right-hand corner.
This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner.
Now, if we can find the left-handed person that painted this, we'll have "The Trial of Mary Dugan" with sound.
Well, I saw that.
- Now, you wait here.
I'm going to need you.
Now look,
We mustn't lose this.
Now take it to your room and leave the door open this time and try that.
And not a word about this to anybody. Not even to me.
Ravelli, we've got to find the left-handed painting.
Now, in a case like this, the first thing to do is to find the motive.
Now, what could have been the motive of the guys who swiped the Beaugard?
Robbery!
Would you mind going out and crossing the boulevard when the lights are against you?
Si, Capt'. Sit down.
You understand, I got an idea how to find this painting.
In a case like this that's so mysterious, you gotta get the clues.
You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method.
Now you go about 'em like this:
You say to yourself, "What happened?"
Then the answer come back: "Something was stolen."
Then you say to yourself, "What was stolen?"
And the answer come back: "A painting."
What are you, a ventriloquist?
Now you say to yourself, "Where was this painting stolen?"
And the answer come back: "In this house."
Now, so far I'm right, eh?
Well, it's pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself all the time.
Now you go a little further and you say to yourself, "Who stole the painting?"
This a very, very important question, Captain.
You get the answer, you got the solution to the whole thing.
Especially if you find the picture.
Now you take all the clues, you put 'em together.
What do ya got huh?
- Bread pudding.
No, here's what we got:
Something was stolen.
Stolen by who?
Somebody in the house.
Now, to find the painting, all you gotta do is go to everybody in the house and ask 'em if they took it.
I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters.
You say you're going to go to everybody in the house and ask 'em if they took the painting?
Suppose nobody in the house took the painting?
- Go to the house next door.
Suppose there is no house next door?
Well, then of course, we gotta build one.
Well, now you're talking.
What kind of a house you think we oughta put up, eh?
Well I tell ya Cap, you see, my idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable.
That's the way I feel about it.
I don't want anything elaborate.
Just a little place that I can call home and tell the wife I won't be there for dinner.
You just want a telephone booth.
No, in that case I'd get in touch with Chic Sales.
What do ya say, Cap, we build right about here?
Here? - Yeah, right about here.
- I'd like something over here if I could get it.
I don't like junior crossing the tracks on his way to the reform school.
I don't like junior at all, as a matter of fact.
Alright. We got something over there, and believe me, that's convenient.
Oh that's very convenient.
Well look, all you gotta do is open the door, step outside, and there you are.
There you are?
There you are where?
Suppose you want to get back in again?
- You had no right to go out.
Well, don't do anything until I hear from you, will you?
Say, maybe that's the painting down in the cellar!
- That's no cellar, that's the roof.
That's the roof down there?
- Yeah, you see we keep the roof in the basement so when the rain comes, the chimney don't get wet.
Well, I'm going out to get x-rayed.
I may be wonderful but I think you're wrong, Ravelli.
- Hey wait, don't get excited.
Come here.
Now look, here's the rooms.
- Those are the rooms?
- Yeah, right here's the rooms.
This is your room. This is my room. And this is the maid's room.
I'd have to go through your room?
That's alright, I won't be in it.
Say, Ravelli, you couldn't put the maid in your room, eh?
- What makes you think I couldn't?
Well, there's going to be a lot of traffic in there. I can see that.
Well, what do ya say?
You ready to sign the lease?
Well, it's a little premature.
I'd like to discuss it with my husband.
Could you come back this evening, when he's home?
Hey, you married?
- Why, I've got a girl as big as you are.
Get me one.
- Don't get vulgar, Ravelli.
Ravelli, how about the painting?
We take care of that alright.
Now I'll tell you what my idea is.
I think the kitchen should be white.
Outside, green. Inside, cerise.
The painting, I say! How about the painting, Ravelli?
What you think I talk?
That's painting, the kitchen white, outside green...
The painting that was stolen!
- Stolen? Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a valuable Beaugard oil painting worth $100,000?
No, I'm a stranger around here.
I don't remember that.
One of the early settlers?
Ravelli, don't you remember Mrs. Beaugard lost a valuable Rittenhouse oil painting? worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, but I've seen you someplace before.
Well, I don't know where I was but I'll stay out of there in the future.
Hey, Capt! It come to me like a flash!
This painting wasn't stolen.
You know what happened, this painting, Captain has disappeared.
And yes, it disappeared.
And you know what make it disappear? You'll never guess, Cap.
What do you think make this painting disappear, heh?
Moths!
Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths!
Go away, I'll be alright in a minute.
Left-handed moths ate the painting, eh? - That's my own solution.
I wish you were in it.
Left-handed moths ate the painting.
You know, I'd buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn't open.
Hey, I got pair of shoes.
C'mon, let's go down and get the reward. We solved it. You solved it.
The credit is all yours.
The painting was eaten by left-handed moths. - Hey, you know, we did a good day's work.
How do you feel, tired?
Maybe you wanna lie down for a couple of years, eh?
Why don't you just lie down until rigor mortis sets in. Now look, Ravelli
I'll tell you how we get the painting.
We go to court and we'll get out a writ of habeas corpus.
You're going to get rid of what?
Oh, I never should have started that way, I can see that.
I say, we'll go to court and we'll get out a writ of habeas corpus. Yes, corpus.
- Didn't you ever see a habeas corpus?
No, but I see "Habeas Irish Rose".
Good morning. - Good morning.
Mr. Chandler, why don't you go down to the beach with the others?
I'm sure you'd feel better.
If I had my Beaugard, I'm sure I'd feel better.
Oh but we're doing everything we can.
Mrs. Rittenhouse! I have it! - The Beaugard!
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!
I... Wait.
This is not my Beaugard, this is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?
In Mr. Parker's room, madam.
- Parker?
The man who made that stole the Beaugard.
Hives, find Mr. Parker and ask him to come here. - Certainly, madam.
Wait.
My men will bring him in.
Go out and get Mr. Parker. Now then, what's the matter with this?
- Well, look at here.
You've only to look at it once to see what it is.
It is a rank imitation.
Mother, what's wrong?
Mr. Parker, something very mysterious has occurred and I'm afraid you're the only one who can explain.
I'd be only too glad to if I can.
Nothing mysterious about it.
We found this in your room.
Now, what have you done with the original Beaugard?
Come clean!
- I think it would be wise...
Well, I have nothing to say except that I don't know where the Beaugard is.
Well, how is it we found this in your room? C'mon, you'd better come with me.
You can't take him.
- Arabella
This program is coming to you from the House of David
He's either got that suit on upside-down or there is no law of gravity.
Einstein or no Einstein.
- My tie!
Captain, what shall I do? They're going to arrest John.
Who's gonna arrest John?
- I am, Captain! Oh you are, eh?
Well, let me tell you something:
the first thing they teach you at Scotland Yard is never to arrest an innocent man. But he's not innocent.
I'll have to arrest him, just the same.
By all means, or nobody will be safe here.
You can't arrest him. I stole it.
- Don't listen to her, Officer.
I did it.
They're both lying.
I did it.
I confess.
Maybe nobody stole the painting. Maybe there was no painting. - That's right.
Maybe there was no painting.
Cut out all the talk!
Who stole the painting?
I did!
- Good gracious.
What, you?
You took the picture?
Aw, that's a horse.
The Beaugard!
That is my Beaugard!
- No, that isn't your Beaugard.
I paid $100,000 for this painting.
I know what I bought.
John Parker.
Somebody changed it.
That is my Beaugard! That is the Beaugard, I tell you.
But that one, that has the color, the depth, the soul of the Beaugard.
Only a master could have produced a painting like that.
You mean, you painted that?
- Why, young man, you're a genius. You're a genius.
I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately.
Well, you'd better make wait until tomorrow.
I'm going to be busy all day. - Yes.
You'd better come with me, young fellow.
- Don't take him away, officer.
He returned the paintings. Pardon me.
My name is Spalding.
I'll let him go this time.
But I want to give you some advice.
You're running around with the wrong kinda people.
You wanna be a crook? Why don't you go home?
- He's got no home.
Go home for a few nights and stay home.
Don't you know your poor old mother sits there sits there, night aft... night after night... waiting to hear your steps on the stairs.
And I can see a little light burning in the... burning in the window.
No you can't!
The gas company turned it off.
What I'm telling you is for your own good.
And if you listen to me, you can't go wrong.
This may go on for years.
- There's just one thing...
I can't understand what's delaying that coffee pot?
Where's the cream?
- Well, you certainly surprised me. Me too.
I thought he had more than that.
- There's no use giving you any advice.
Captain, this time I'm afraid I'll have to take him.
Oh, what are you doing? My dear!
Hey, what's the idea?
- Jamison, take a letter to my lawyers.
Oh no, don't! Oh no, oh no no, not, Anything but...
Oh the things that I've got to go...
C'mon now, let's get out of here before they all wake up.
Hurry up. C'mon.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon...
Either you're flat orl am.
Always the lady.
Say-
- Say, what the--?
Why,I frighten your hiccup away, Marthy.
Yes, you did.
And I'm going to hit you.
See here. If you soak me in the eye again I'm gonna quit you.
-You get me? -No.
Only on the back this time, Marthy.

-Well,I think you lose them, Marthy.
Yes,I did.

Yeah, well.

You're not sorry you took me back, are you?
Oh, no, Marthy. I'm darn glad I found you in Norfolk.

-That's it, Marthy.
Oh, Marthy, hold my hand.
Well,I declare.
How can you do a thing like that?
Wait a minute, now.

See, that's-
There we are.
-We go down and get a drink.
-No, wait, hon.
Oh, the horses.

Oh,I got money, plenty money.
Speak of the devil, Chris, we was just talking about you.
-Hello, Chris, put it there.

What you think you like for drink, whiskey?
Well, I'll take a scoop of lager and ale for a chaser.
I go bring back for you, Marthy.
Lager and ale for Marthy, Larry.

Right you are. By the way, Chris, we've got a letter for you from St. Paul, Minnesota.
And a lady's writing.
Then that must come from my daughter, Anna.
She living there.
I don't get letter from Anna, must be year.
That's a fine fairy tale, your daughter.
Sure, I'll bet it's from some skirt.
Oh, no, this come from Anna.
By golly,I think I'm too drunk to read that letter from Anna.
I thinkI go sit down for minute.
You bring drink in backroom, Larry.
Well, where's my lager and ale, you old stiff?
Oh, Larry bring. Larry bring, sweetheart.
Well, what do you got there?
Well, by jiminy, what you think of that?
My daughter, Anna, say she coming here right away.
She got sick on job in St. Paul, she saying.
It's a short letter, it don't tell me much more than that.
By golly, that's good news all one time for old fella.
You know, Marthy,I told you I don't see my Anna since she was little girl in Sweden, 5 year old.
How old will she be now?
Oh, she must be-
- She must be 20 year old, by Jove.
-You've not seen her for 1 5 years?
I think it's better Anna live on farm.
Then she don't never know that.... That old devil sea.
She don't know father like me.
This girl will marry a sailor herself, likely.
It's in the blood.
No, by golly, she don't do that.
Here! What are you trying to do, spill my suds for me?
Oh, what's up with you?
Ain't you a sailor yourself?
Yes, and that's just whyi say it.
Sailor is all right fella, but not for marry girl.
I know that. Anna's mother, she know that too.
When is your daughter coming? Soon?
Why,I forget.I see.
Well, she say she coming right away, that's all.
She'll be coming here to look for you, I suppose.
Better hang around, Chris.
-Marthy--
-Well, what do you want?
I'm wise to what's in the back of your nut old squarehead.
You wanna get rid of me because your kid's coming, huh?
Wanna kick me out, huh?
Well, see here, Chris. There ain't no Swede on no boat that's man enough to get away with that.
Don't you start nothing you can't finish.
No,I don't start nothing, Marthy.
No, you don't.
You're a scream.
Oh, honestly....
You're a knockout.
I don't see nothing for laugh at.
You don't? Go and take a slant at yourself in the mirror.
Old squarehead, huh?
Trying to kid Marthy Owens, huh?
Oh, I'm onto the game.
I wasn't born and dragged up on no waterfront for nothing.
You thought I'd make trouble, didn't you?
Not me.
I'm packing my duds and I'm quitting you.
Yeah, I'm leaving you flat.
There's plenty of guys on plenty of boats waiting for me.
Always was.
I always found them.
So cheer up, old squarehead.
I'll be out of the way before your kid gets here.
You'll be rid of me for good, and me of you.
-And good riddance to both of us. -You.
That's a good girl, Marthy.
Oh, "good girl."
Cut that bull.
Oh, well, you was always square with me, so it's fifty-fifty and nobody owes nobody nothing, do they?
-Still friends?
-Oh, by golly, yes, Marthy.
Blow me another scoop of lager and ale, and I'll drink your kid's health.
-And I'll--

Then I'm old grandfather, by golly.
By Jiminy Cricket, we gotta celebrate that.
-Come on, Larry. Give us a drink, there.
You're soused to the ears, that's what you are.
-Oh, you bet, you celebrate--
-I know,I know, but go on put some food in you and sober up.
Here, you old fool.
You don't know when your kid's coming here, do you?
-Oh, well....
-Well you wanna be sober when she does get here, don't you?
-Oh, by golly, that's so, Marthy.
-Well, then go throw a beef stew in you and-- Go on, around the corner.
I do that, Marthy.
I been coming right back.
Oh, well, that's that.
Give me a whiskey. Ginger ale on the side.
And don't be stingy, baby.
-Well, shalll serve it in a pail?
-Well, that suits me down to the ground.
Gee,I needed that bad, all right, all right.
Oh, sure. You look all in.
Have you been on a bat?
No. Traveling.
Day and a half on a train.
Had to sit up all night in a dirty coach too.
I thought I'd never get here.
-Where'd you come from?
-St. Paul, out in Minnesota.
Minnesota?
Then you're the--?
All the way from Minnesota, sure.
Say, what are you laughing at? Me?
Sure, kid. No, l-- I was thinking of something else.
Well,I wouldn't blame you, at that.
I guessI do look rotten.
I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.
I'm gonna have another drink.
What do you say?
Will you have something on me?
Little service here, please.
-Same for me.
-Oh, same here.
Sit over here.
Let's be friends, yeah?
I'm a dead stranger in this burg, you know.
-Skoal.
Here's how, huh?
-Here's luck.
Let you smoke in here, won't they?
Sure, but throw it away if you hear someone coming.
Well, ain't they fussy in this dump.
is there anything wrong with me?
You're sure looking hard enough.
I ain't gotta look very hard.
I got your number the minute you come in the room.
Well,I got yours too, without no trouble.
You're me, 40 years from now. That's you.
Well,I wanna tell you straight, kiddo that Marthy Owens never--
Oh, let's cut out the scrapping.
I don't want no hard feelings with no one.
-Come on, let's shake and be friends.
I ain't looking for trouble either.
Let's have another, huh?
Say, don't you think you'd better go kind of easy on that stuff?
Well,I guess you're right.
I gotta meet someone too.
My old man.
I ain't seen him sinceI was a kid.
Don't even know what he looks like.
I just got a letter now and then.
This was always the only address he gave me to write him back.
He used to be a sailor. He's a janitor of some building here.
-A janitor?
AndI was thinking, seeing he ain't done a thing for me in my life he might be willing to stake me with a room and eats untill could rest up.
ButI ain't expecting much from him.
Give you a kick when you're down, that's what all men do.
AndI don't suppose he'll turn out no better than the rest.
Do you hang around this dump much?
Oh, off and on.
Why, maybe you know him, my old man.
Well, it-- lt isn't old Chris, is it?
-Who, old Chris?
-Yeah, Chris Christopherson.
-That's his full name.
Anna Christopherson is my real name only out there,I call myself Anna Christie.
-So you know him, huh?
-Oh, I've seen him around here for years.
What kind is he?
Well, he's as fine an old guy as ever walked on two feet and that goes.
Why, you think he'll stake me to the rest cure I'm after, then?
Surest thing you know.
Where'd you get the idea that he was a janitor?
Well, he wrote me he was himself.
He's lying.
He's a captain on a barge.
A barge?
What kind of a barge?
Well, coal, mostly.
A coal barge?
Well, well.
If that ain't a swell job to find your long-lost old man working at.
Well, that puts the kibosh on his giving me a rest.
Couldn't you live on it too?
On a dirty coal barge?
Well, what do you thinkI am?
Well, what do you know about a barge?
Bet you ain't never seen a barge.
That's what comes of him bringing you up inland where you'd be safe.
Say, his bringing me up, is that what he tells people?
Well,I sure like his nerve.
Why, he let them cousins keep me on the farm and work me to death like a dog.
Well, you didn't fall for that farm life, did you?
I should say not.
I had to slave for all of them.
Was all right till my mother died buti was only a poor relation, you know and they treated me worse than they dared treat a hired girl.
Oh, what a life on that farm out in Minnesota.
With them Swedes, woman-hungry.
One nightI was alone in the house and one of the sons came back.
After that,I hated them, so I'd kill them all ifI stayed sol ran away.
Yeah,I overheard Chris saying as how you was in St. Paul.
-Working, he said.
-Oh, that's no lie.
I went there to work, butI was still a kid.
It's all men's fault, giving you the wrong start.
I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.
The judge gave all of us girls 30 days.
Well, the others didn't seem to mind being in the cooler much.
ButI couldn't stand it.I went nuts.
I never could stand being caged up nowhere.
I got good and sick, and they had to send me to the hospital.
And it was nice there.
I was sorry to leave it, honest.
If my old man doesn't help me it's men again.
Men all the time.
Oh, howl hate them, every mother's son of them. Don't you?
Well, there's good ones and there's bad ones, you know.
Now, your old man, old Chris.
Oh, he's a good one, honest.
Well, he'll have to show me.
Wait till he finds out.
Well, you know, he's kind of simple.
He's got nutty notions.
You know, he thinks that--
He thinks you're working as a nurse girl in St. Paul.
You know, he thinks that- - He means all right, honest.
He thinks the world of you.
Honest, he does.
Quit your kidding.
Well, as soon asI get rested up I'll clear out and get back to the old job in St. Paul.
Josephine Come board the ship
Long time I wait for you
-Your old man.
Golly, Larry.
That grub, it taste good.

-Sure, and another tramp with her.
That's him, you see.
He's coming in here.
Now, brace up.
Oh, hello, old Chris.
Say, listen, I'm gonna blow down to the barge and pack my duds and beat it.
She's in there.
Your Anna.
Yeah, she's just come.
And you treat her right.
Well.... So long.
Well, so long, kid.I gotta beat it.
I'll see you later.
She told me it was you.
I just got here a little while ago.
Oh, it's-
- It's good for see you after all them years, Anna.
Well, it's good to see you too.
Anna lilla.
Oh,I had an awful trip getting here.

I've never been in New York before, and....
I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.
You, Anna?
Oh, by golly.
But you feel better now, though, don't you?
You look little tired, that's all.
I am tired to death.
I need a long rest.
That's whyi made up my mind to come and see you.
Oh,I got nice place for rest, Anna.
You rest all you want.
You don't never got to be nurse girl no more.
You stay with me, by golly.
You're really glad to see me, honest?
Oh, Anna, I'm glad more like everything for see you,I tell you.
Don't you talk no more about getting job.
I don't see you for long time and I'm getting old.
I got no one in world but you and I'm going to tell you about everything and you tell me all thing what happen to you.
But not here, now.
This ain't no good place for young girlies.
Only no-good sailor fella come here for get drunk.
You need lie down, get a rest.
-We go onboard.
-Onboard your barge, you mean?
Well, nix for mine.
Do you think that's a good place for a young girl? coal barge?

For make you strong, healthy girl again.
You need a rest like that.
You work too hard for young girl already.
You need vacation, eh?
Well, it sounds pretty good, to hear you tell it.
I'd sure like a trip on the water, all right.
I'll go down with you and have a look.
Maybe I'll take a chance.
Seeing America from a coal barge, that's a good one.
What's the rush?
-Gee, I'm thirsty.
-Oh, I'm sorry, Anna.
What you think you like for drink?
Well, I'll take a....
Oh,I don't know, really.
What have they got here?
I don't think they got much fancy drink for young girl in this place.
Well, say, ginger ale or sarsaparilla, maybe.
Well, make it sarsaparilla.
I tell you, Anna, we celebrate, just this once because we meet after many year.
They got some good port wine.
Now, that's good for you,I think.
It ain't strong, neither.
One glass, he don't go to your head, I promise.
-All right. I'll take port.
-I go get it.
Well, who's the blond?
That's Anna, Larry.
-Your daughter, Anna?

Sure, a peach.

Why, you look a little tired, Anna buti make you take good, long rest now.
You drink your wine.
That put new life in you.
Skoal, Anna.
You know that Swedish word?
I guessI know that word, all right, all right.
A bridge, Anna, it's pretty, eh?
Gives you the creeps, though.
It's like a great big spiderweb.
Oh, you're tired, you sick, Anna.
Someday, bridge, he look awfully pretty to you.
I bet your life those big buildings make you open your eyes.
Well, it scares me to think of being up so high.
I bet we look like ants to them.
I bet they can't even see us down here.
On trip back, I take you up in Woolworth Building.
There you see everything.
I've seen too much already.
You know, Anna, you was awful pretty girl.
I bet you all men see you fall in love with you, by Jiminy.
You cut that. You talk just as they all do.
No harm your father talk that way, Anna.
Oh, fine father you are.
Like a stranger.
Why didn't you ever come out west to see me?
I'm sorry, Anna, but after your mother die I want come see you end of every voyage but whenI get money for coming west,I forget.
I get drunk and spend all money.
I don't know why, Anna, but that's the way with most sailor fella.
That old devil sea.
She make them crazy fools with her dirty tricks. ls so.
Well, it's good you got something to blame it on.
Kind of tough for me, though.
I know, Anna, I'm sorry. But if you stay with me,I make you glad.
I make you forgive me for being no-good father.
It sounds okay with me.
I'll try anything once.
I'm glad you like it here on barge with your old father, Anna.
Who saidI like it?
Well, you change a lot in one week.
The sea air make you feel good again, eh?
Maybe.I don't know.
Four bells.
What time is that?
Funny, all this sea talk. I'm getting onto the lingo.
Now, there's where you belong, on a real ship like that sailing all over the world.
I do that many year whenI was big fool.
Say, was all the men in our family always sailors?
Yes. All men in our family crazy fools.
My father and my three brothers is buried at sea lost on sailboat.
Just like your brothers was drowned.
Sailor man is no good, Anna.
They don't never come home.
Don't never do nothing what good men do.
And sooner or later, that old devil, she swallow them up.
But she don't gonna got me.
No, by Jiminy, not me.
Beefing about the sea again.
Well, I'm getting sol kind of like it.
Anna, you was scaredI got hurt.
Oh, gee,I thought you were overboard, honest.
You been sorry if that old devil, he got Chris, eh?
Why, sure.
Ain't you my father?
Oh, that's a sure thing.
You like me little, maybe?
Can the sentiment, Pa.
I'll fix you a whiskey toddy.
I'll pull off your boots first, though.
Oh, Anna, you make old fella want to cry.
Nix on the sob stuff now.
Heave, hearty!
Oh, don't go away, Anna, don't go away.
You was my little girl.
My Anna lilla.
-Yes. HereI am.
Why you don't come turn in, Anna?
It's late, it's after four bells.
I like this fog, honest.
It makes me feel as ifI was out of things altogether.
Fog.
That's one of the worst dirty tricks of that old devil.
Funny.I feel sort of strange tonight.
Sort of nutty as if I've been living a long, long time out here in the fog.
I don't know just how to tell you whatI mean.
But it's like I've come home from a long visit someplace andI seem to have forgotten all that's happened.
Like it didn't matter anymore.
You must think I'm off my base.
Oh, Anna,I want always make you happy.
We fool that old devil.
We sell barge.
And you and me, we live together in nice little house inland.
Inland? You mean leave the sea?
By golly, we have a little house, just you and me and maybe sometime comes along a nice land fella.
You get married. You have kids.
Oh, by Jiminy, that sure is a pretty picture, Anna.
Maybe.I wanna be with you but somehow I don't wanna leave the sea.
She's old devil, Anna.
Don't let her get you.
Well, ain't it natural, me loving the sea? It's in the blood, ain't it?
I think I'm a big fool for bring you on this voyage, Anna.
Now you're talking nutty yourself.
You act as if you were scared something was gonna happen.
-Only God know that, Anna.
-Well, then, it'll be God's will like the preachers say, what does happen.
No. That old devil, she ain't God.
-Oh, that scare me for a minute.
is just some fisherman lose his course in fog.
Sound come from this side.
They come in from open sea.
What's trouble?
Heave a rope when we come alongside.
-Where are you, you scut?
Right you are.
Why don't he stay where he belongs.
Johnson, come and give a hand.
Anna, you go in cabin, get whiskey, please.
Those fellas will need a drink for fix them up.
Johnson, come here.
Give me a hand here with this fella.
-What is it, sir?
-They come in from the open sea.
-Must be sailor fellas.
-The open sea?
That old devil is doing something again, Johnson.
Three of them there.
-Did you see them there, Johnson?
-Sure, a couple of them is out.
Make fast rope there, you fella.
Heave away.
-Johnson, you get that other fella there.
Anna, get whiskey, quick.
These here sailor fellas their steamer got wrecked in storm.
Been five days in open sea.
Johnson brings another fella. You take whiskey to him.
Take your whiskey, here.
Are these all?
I'll get whiskey inside.
Take that to the man's who's coming onboard now.
What's this tub?
Well, we're safe anyhow, with the help of God.
Sure, it's me, Matt Burke himself, dreaming again.
You drink this and you'll find it's no dream.
The devil with the drink.
But I'll be taking it anyhow.
Sure, I'm needing that.
It's fine stuff.
But it wasn't the drinkI meant whenI said, wasI dreaming.
Sure,I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea, come to torment me.
Aye, real flesh and blood, devil the less.
Cut that.
What's a fine, handsome woman the like of yourself doing on this scow?
You're a great one, honest.
Starting right in kidding after what you've been through.
I'm telling you, but for the strength and guts in me, we'd be scoffed by the fishes this minute.
Gee, you hate yourself, don't you?
But you must come and lie down and go to sleep.
Lie down and sleep, is it?
But you'll not be thinking I'm a weak scut.
Sure,I could lick any man on this boat with one hand tied behind me back.
I could lick all hands on this tub one by one, tired asI am.
Ain't you the hard guy, though, huh?
But never mind that fight talk.
I'll take your word for what you say.
You're all in, own up to it.
The devill am.
Well, be stubborn, then, for alll care.
AndI must sayi don't care for your language.
The meni know don't pull rough stuff when ladies are around.
Ladies!
Let you not be making game of me.
Whisht, now, milady, it's one of your kisses I'm needing to take the tiredness from me bones. One kiss, now.
Let go of me, you--!
Oh, gee,I was scared for a moment I'd killed you.
"Killed you," you say?
Faith, it would take more than a bit of a blow to crack my thick skull.
Glory be, you got a power of strength in them fine arms of yours.
I'm sorry it happened.
Only, you've no right to be getting fresh with me.
Listen, now, don't go getting any more wrong notions.
I'm on this barge because I'm making a trip with my father.
The captain is my father. Now you know.
I'm thinking I'm not good enough to kiss the shoe soles of a fine, decent girl the like of yourself.
Will you forgive me now and let's be friends from this out?
I'm thinking I'd rather be friends with you than anything else in the world.
-Sure.
It is a clumsy apeI am.
Sure, it is great powerI have in me hand and arm, andI do be forgetting it at times.
You're sure strong, all right.
Sure, it is the will of God in it that brought me safe through the storm to the one spot in the world where you was.
Think of that, now, and isn't it queer?
Anna, you get in cabin, you hear?
Who do you think you're talking to, a slave?
You need to rest, Anna.
What are you doing here, you sailor fella? You ain't sick like others.
You get in forecastle, they give you bunk. You hurry,I tell you.
But he's sick.
He can hardly stand up. Look at him.
is it giving me orders you are, me bucko?
Let you look out, then.
Weak asI am, I can break you in pieces and throw you over the side, and your crew after you.
I was forgetting, you're her old man.
Sure, I'd not lift a fist to you for the world.
You can have my bed if there is no other place.
That's your dirty trick, old devil but you don't do that, no, not that whileI live.
Mulligan!
Sure, it is myself that's hungry.
And a pie, Matt.
Glory be, what doI care for a stew or a pie?
It's not for food I'm hungry...
-...but for the sight of your face.
-Oh, go on with your blarney, you gasbag.
Now, Matt, look what you've done.
Pick that up. Shame on you.
Sure, her with the face of an angel and the sting of a wasp.
Oh, so it's darning you're doing.
Shut up. You've got a voice like a foghorn.
Well, what do you think it is?
Well, holding it up this way, it might be new underdrawers for old Chris.
-Ain't for him, though.
-Oh, ain't it, now?
-For some sweetheart?
Don't make me jealous, or I'll burn it up and him in it.
-No. Give it to me.
-You got a guilty look in your eye.
Now, you give it to me, now. You bully.
Now....
-Look what you've done, galoot.
-WhenI get ahold of him that wears it I'll pull out an arm and wave you goodbye with it.
Supper's almost ready.
Well, I've been hungry.
Well, asi was saying to you before....
Stand up, just to measure this sweater.
Sure,I will. On me head or me feet?
Your feet, silly.
It is only prayer or paralysis can save you now, Anna.
Well, I'm praying, Matt.
It is a miracle if your prayers are answered.
And him hating to stand up for measurements.
-Will you wear it for my sake?
It is a lie in your throat and you know it.
No, it isn't.
You made it for me with your own blessed hands.
And I'll wear it when we dock in New York and take you out for a day's fun.
Oh, no, you won't. It won't be finished by then.
I won't go with you. Make up your mind to that.
-Yes, you'll go with me.
-Oh, no,I won't.
-Just the two of us.
Well, you won the capital prize, fella.
Anybody else around?
Here we go, boys.
Why don't you test your lungs too, Matt.
I should test them, with the fine bellows thatI got?
Well, try it.
Faith, that's a woman's game. Not for a husky like me.
You try it, Anna.
You do it.I haven't got the wind in me that you have.
Watch me. Sure, I've air enough in me chest to blow up a balloon.
Well,I don't doubt it.
What do you mean, you don't doubt it?
I bet he goes to 40.
Step up and roll the sweet mamas out of their beds.
Make your own sweet mama jealous.
Only 25 cents to see the most enchanting scene on Coney Island.
Now there's Lily and Clytie without any nighties.
Hey, you, step right up.
Give us a good free look at the mamas in their pretty lace hootenannies.
Wanna keep us in bed all night, tightwad?
Loosen up, lads.
Give us a little tumble.
I'll bet you couldn't hit that target if you stayed until you grew a long, white beard.
-The devill couldn't.
-Come on, Matt.
Go on and try it.
Bet you can't even hit the net.
-Yeah, how about a home run, Babe Ruth?
-Sure,I dare you to.
With one throw,I could knock them dames off of their bunks.
Go to it, big boy.
Don't overlook me, carrot top.I have the shape that makes the old men young...
-...and the young men old.
-Attaboy.
-Mama wants Papa.
-Papa wants Mama.
Some mamas too.
Now somebody else.
Somebody that packs a mean right.
What we want this time is a regular he-man.
You shut up or I'll wrap you around the target.
Don't get sore, big boy.
It's a hot night.
Roll me out of the blanket.
And that be the end to the story of the whale and the grasshopper.
Oh, Matt, honest, I ain't ever laughed like this.
-You're funny.
-Sure, I'd think it was blarney if it wasn't meseIf was making you laugh.
Oh, sure, Anna, you're crazy about me, and I'm not after blaming you.
You just hate yourself, don't you, Matt?
Oyster loaf for the lady, sir.
-I ordered milk for the lady.
-Well, I've got it here.
Well, let's drink to our good health.
And skoal, Matt, to you and me.
-Hot mustard, Matt?
-I don't need it.
-Pepper?
-Full of it.
-Well, here's something you do need.
-Oh, is that so, now?
Well, all right. But if I'm needing sugar, I know where to look for that.
Oh, we're goofy, Matt.
Just like a couple of kids.
Sure, Anna, when you're in love, you ain't got the brains of a tick.
What do you mean, love?
You know whatI mean, Anna.
It's in me eye and on the tip of me tongue.
A man like me ain't given to loving a woman.
He knows too much about them.
Every color of them, from here to the China Sea.
The whole lying, cheating smear of them.
Sailors' bait.
When he comes across a girl like you, Anna that's as clean as a shell.
You're a lucky girl to be hearing such talk from the lips of Matt Burke him that the women are so crazy over.
Anna, what's come over you?
Sure, don't lie to me, Anna.
You're as stiff as a corpse.
Hello, dearie.
-Well, I'll be--
-Well, she's a friend of mine.
Aren't you, dearie?
I'm afraidI don't remember you.
-She don't remember me.
-Of course she don't, you old scab.
-Beat it, or I'll have you thrown in the brig.
-No, Matt, maybeI do know her.
That old sea cow?
Go on, clear out of here.
You know a nice young girl never met the likes of you.
A nice young--?
A nice young-- Pure and white as a lily.
Shut up, or I'll choke the wind out of your gullet.
Oh, Matt, let her alone.
She don't mean nothing by it.
Anna, darling.
You see what you've done? You frightened her.
-Go on, clear out of here.
-I'm going, I'm going.
I was lying, Matt.
I know her and she knows me.
I recognized her the minute she stepped across the room.
Shut up, kid.
You don't have to spill over for nobody.
You ain't responsible for what your old man does.
I'll tell you why she didn't want to talk to me.
Because I'm a tramp, that's why.
And her old man kicked me off the barge when she come there to live on it.
Yeah, he didn't want any old wharf rat around a nice young girl.
Well, it ain't so, though, Matt.
She's lying.
Lying, I'm ly--?
Well,I like your nerve, all right, all right.
Gee, I'm sorryI came here to speak to you.
Insulting me. Well, can you beat it?
I'll be toddling along.
I'm glad you found yourself such a nice, friendly gent.
I hope you're happy, kid.
I'm sorryI bothered you, honest, l-- Oh, forget it, Ann.
You only got one life to live.
And it's a...of a life at that.
Say, skipper, you wouldn't stake me to a quarter, would you?
You know,I haven't had a drink in a month.
Take it and beat it.
With pleasure, captain.
Well, so long.
Be a good girl, Ann, no matter how lonesome.
Happy days. Happy days.
The poor old devil.
SometimesI feel sorry for them.
Come on, Anna. Don't let it get you down.
Sure, the world's full of them.
I know it's a sad sight for a decent young girl the like of yourself, darling.
What would you say, Matt, ifI told you that...?
Say what, me darling?
Sure,I know what you'll be wanting to tell me soon, if not this minute that you love me.
Don't be so sure of yourself, Matt.
I'm loving nobody.
And you'll be wanting to marry me, and maybe I'll be accepting you.
Why, Matt.
You want to marry me?
-Honest?
-Sure, I'll marry you.
Only, don't be putting me to too many tests, orl might change me mind.
I'm tired, Matt.
I wanna go back to the barge.
You- - You think you love that sailor fella, Anna?
Well, what ifI do?
You think maybe you marry him?
I'm glad you don't marry sailor, Anna. is bad for woman.
They don't never see their men only once in long while.
You sit and wait all alone and when their boys grow up and go on sea they sit and wait some more.
Any girl marry sailor is crazy fool, I tell you.
Your mother, she tell you same thing if she was alive.
Well, that ain't whyi won't marry him.
I'm not thinking about myself but about him.
He's such a simple guy, a big kid.
AndI haven't got the heart to fool him.
You fool him?
Oh, you go crazy,I think.
I've been thinkingI was myself the last few days.
I love to watch the ships passing.
When Matt comes along, tell him whereI am, will you?
All right,I tell him.
Well, God bless who's here.
How's the world treating you this afternoon, Anna's father?
Oh, pretty good, if it ain't for some fellas.
Meaning me, do you?
Well, if you ain't the funny old crank of a man.
Where's herself?
-Where's Anna, I'm after asking you.
-She gone out to look on boat.
Well, I'll be going out to her.
But beforeI go, I'll take this chance while we're alone to have a word with you. And that word is soon done.
I'm marrying your Anna before this day is out. You may as well make up your mind to it, like it or no.
That's easy for saying.
You meanI won't? is it yourself is after stopping me, do you think?
-I stop it if it come to worst.
-Sure, it isn't trouble I'm looking for.
You're her father. Wouldn't it be a shame for us to be at each others' throats like a pair of dogs, andI married to Anna.
So out with the truth, man alive.
What is it you're holding against me at all?
I don't want my Anna for got married.
Listen, you fella. I'm old man.
I don't see my Anna for 1 5 year.
She's alll got in the world.
You think now when she come on first trip, I want her for leave me alone again?
Sure, let you not be thinking I've no heart at all for the way you'd be feeling.
Then you do right thing, eh?
You ship away again and leave my Anna alone.
Say, big fella like you on sea, he don't need a wife.
He got new girl in every port, you know that.
Sure, Anna's the one woman in the world for me andI can't live without her now, I'm thinking.
You think I'm going let her life be made sorry by you just like her mother's was made by me?
No, she don't marry you.
Not ifI have to kill you first.
Glory be to God, what talk from a stumpy runt of a man.
It is queer fool's blather you have, about the sea done this and the sea done that.
You ought to be ashamed to be saying the like, you an old sailor.
I'm hearing a lot from you, and a lot more that Anna tells me you do be saying to her.
Not a man at all.
You see if I'm man maybe quicker than you think.
You know the truth in your heart.
The sea hit you a clout once and knocked you down.
You're not man enough to get up for another, but you lie there howling murder.
I'd like to see you in the best of your youth.
-Do whatI done in the storm and after.
-Why, you young fool, you.
In old days, whenI was on windjammer I went through hundred storms worse than that.
Ships were ships then, and men what sailing them real men.
What you got on steamers now?
You got fellas on deck don't know a ship from a mud scow and below deck, you got fellas just know how to shovel coal.
You might as well work on coal wagon ashore, you.
is it throwing insults at the men in the stokehold you are, you old ape?
One of them is worth any 1 0 squareheads ever shipped on a windbag.
-You Irish swine.
-So you don't like the Irish, you old baboon?
Sure, it's that you're needing in your family.
A man of the stokehold to put guts in it so you'll not be rearing up grandchildren to be jackasses like yourself.
Sure, old men getting childish shouldn't play with knives.
Faith, I've half a mind to hit you a clout will put sense in your square head.
Keep away from me, now.
Are you here already?
Say, what's up? How did that chair get knocked over?
Oh, Matt, you haven't been fighting with him, after you promised?
I've not laid a hand on him, Anna.
I told him to his teethI love you.
That's God's truth, and well you know it.
He tell same thing to girl in every port he goes.
I know it's true, Matt.
Don't you mind what he says.
And thenI saidI thought maybe you'd have a bit of love for me too.
So you told him that?
MaybeI have.
I've been wondering ifI do love you.
I didn't want to,I must own up to that.
But l--I guessI can't help it, sol guessI do.
Oh, sure,I do, Matt.
What's the use of kidding myself different?
-Sure,I love you.
-God be praised.
AndI haven't ever loved a man in my life before, never.
Faith, we'll be having a grand, beautiful life together to the end of our days.
-Goodbye, Matt.
-Goodbye, is it?
I'll be coming at you in a second for more of the same.
Own up like a man when you're beat fair and square.
Here's me hand to you.
We'll be friends from this out.
No,I don't shake hands with you, fella.
Not whileI live.
The back of me hand to you, then, if that suits you.
It's a rotten bad loser you are, devil mend you.
No,I don't lose.
Anna said she like you little bit.
But you don't hear her say she marry you,I bet.
No, andI don't hear her say the sun is shining, either.
-No,I didn't say it, Matt.
-There, you hear?
You're waiting to be asked, you mean?
Well, I'm asking you now.
We'll be wedded this day, with the help of God.
-You heard whatI said afterI kissed you.
I said goodbye. That kiss was for goodbye, Matt.
We've said goodbye, that's all.
-I knew that was so.
-ls it making game of me you'd be?
It's a queer time to joke with me.
Don't be doing it, for the love of God.
You don't think I'd kid you now.
I'm not joking, Matt.I mean whatI say.
You don't. You can't.
It is mad you are, I'm telling you.
-What's come over you so sudden?
You were saying you love me.
I'll say that as often as you want me to.
But why? What? What is it?
Because it's the best wayI can figure out, Matt.
I've been thinking it over and thinking it over, day and night, all week.
Oh, don't think it isn't hard on me too, Matt.
Well, will you tell me what's preventing this wedding when the two of us has love?
I'm thinking it's listening to that old fool you are him hating me, filling your ears full of lies against me.
Yes, Anna believe me, not you.
She know her old father don't lie like you.
You sit down, do you hear?
Why do you come butting in and making things worse?
You're like a devil, you are.
HereI was, beginning to like you, beginning to forget all the things...
-... I've held up against you.
-You ain't got nothing for hold against me.
Haven't I, though?
Well, let me tell you.
Matt, I'm surprised at you.
-You didn't think anything he'd said--
-Sure, what else would it be?
Tell me, and don't keep me waiting.
I can't tell you, andI won't.
I've got a good reason, that's all you need to know.
I can't marry you, and that's all there is to it.
So for heaven's sake, let's talk of something else.
No, I'll not.
-ls it married to someone else you are?
-I should say not.
You're like them women can't make up their minds till they're drove to it. Well, I'll make up your mind for you.
We've had enough talk.
Let's go to the other room and dress in your best.
We're going ashore.
-She don't do that.
-Where do you get that stuff?
Never mind, get on with your dressing.
-We'll see who'll win in the end, me or you.
-Stay, Anna.
She will not. She'll do whatI say.
You've had your hold on her long enough.
-It's my turn now.
-Your turn? What ami anyway?
Never mind what you are.
It's what you're gonna be:
Wedded to me.
Come on with your dressing.
-Don't do one thing he say!
-She will!
-She will in spite of you.
She's taking my orders from now on, not yours.
Orders is good.
Never mind now. We've no time to be wasting.
-Do you hear what I'm telling you?
-No, stay here, Anna!
You can go to blazes, both of you.
You'd thinkI was a piece of furniture.
I'll show you. Sit down.
Sit down, do you hear? Let me talk for a minute.
You're all wrong, see?
I'm gonna tell you two something, and then I'm gonna beat it.
I've been meaning to turn it loose on you every time you get my goat with your crazy talk about wanting to keep me safe inland.
I wasn't going to tell you, but you've forced me into it.
Oh, what's the use?
It's all wrong anyway.
You might as well get cured this way as any other.
Don't forget what you said about it not mattering to you what reasonI got as long asI wasn't married already.
That's me word, and I'll stick to it.
You make me laugh, honest.
Wanna bet you will?
You was going on as if one of you had to own me.
But nobody owns me, see, excepting myself.
I'll do whatI please. And no man, I don't give a darn who he is can tell me what to do. I ain't asking either of you for a living.
I'll make it myself, one way or another.
I am my own boss. Now, put that in your pipe and smoke it.
-You and your orders.
-I wasn't meaning it that way at all and well you know it.
You've no call to raise this rumpus with me.
-lt is him, you've a right.
-I'm coming to him.
But you, you did mean it that way.
You sounded just like all the rest.
It is queer, rough talk, that, for a decent girl the like of yourself.
Decent.
Who told youI was?
I'm talking to you now.
I don't want to hear.
You go out your head,I think.
Well, living with you is enough to drive anyone off their nut.
Your bunk about the farm being so fine.
Didn'tI write you, year after year, how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins made out of me?
What did you care? Nothing.
Not even enough to come out and see me.
Your crazy stuff about wanting to keep me away from the sea don't go down with me. You just didn't want to be bothered with me.
-Oh, that ain't so, Anna.
-But one thingi never wrote you it was one of them cousins that you think is such nice people that started me wrong.
And it was none of my fault.
I hated him and he knew it.
But he was big and strong, like you.
That's whyi ran away from the farm.
That's what made me get a job as a nurse girl in St. Paul.
You think that was a nice job for a girl, too, don't you?
With all them nice inland fellas just looking for a chance to marry me.
They weren't looking for marrying.
You don't say nothing.
Either one of you.
ButI know what you're thinking.
You're just like all the rest.
And who's to blame for it?
If you'd been a regular father and had me with you...
-...things would've been different.
-Don't talk that way.
-I go crazy.I won't listen to you.
-You will listen.
You, keeping me safe inland. I was no nurse girl the last two years.
I lied whenI wrote you.
I was in a house, that's what.
Yes, that kind of a house.
The kind that sailors like Matt and you go to in port and your nice inland men too.
And all men.
I hate them,I hate them....
-Oh, it's a lie, Anna, it's a lie....
-So that's what's in it.
I suppose you remember your promise.
No other reason was to count with you as long asI wasn't married already.
You want me to get dressed and go ashore, don't you?
Oh, yes, you do.
I suppose ifI tried to tell you thatI wasn't that no more you'd believe me, wouldn't you?
AndI sized you up as different from the ones on land, as water is from mud.
I couldn't marry you with you believing a lie.
AndI was ashamed to tell you the truth.
And now, give me a bawling-out and beat it likel can tell you're going to.
Will you believe it ifI tell you that loving you has made me clean?
It's straight goods, honest.
Oh, yes, you will. You're just like all the rest.
The rest, is it?
My curse on you. Clean, is it?
Oh, don't, Matt.
Let me alone. Get out of here!
I'll be going. And I'll be drinking slews of whiskey so to wash that black kiss of yours off me lips!
And I'd be getting dead, rotten drunk so I'll not remember you at all!
I'll ship away on a boat to the end of the world, where I'll never see your face again!
-Oh, don't go.
It's better Anna marry you--
-Let go of me, you old ape!
Marry her, is it?
I'd see her dead at me feet first.
I'm shipping away out of this, I'm telling you.
My curse on you, and the curse of all the saints.
-I go ashore too.
-Not after him,I tell you.
Don't you dare.
Oh,I go for get drink.
I'm driving you to drink too, huh?
You wanna get drunk so you can forget, like him.
Aye. You thinkI like hear them things? Oh, Anna.
Anna,I think you wasn't that kind of girl.
You want me to beat it, don't you?
You don't want me here disgracing you,I suppose.
Oh, no, no, Anna.
It ain't your fault,I know that.
It's that old devil do this to me.
It was all right on barge, with just you and me.
Then she bring that Irish fellow in fog.
That fella, he don't never come, you don't never tell me them things.
I don't never know.
Then everything is all right.
Oh, that dirty devil sea.
Oh, what's the use?
Go ashore and get drunk.
You wait here, Anna?
Maybe I'll get drunk too.
Maybe I'll.... 0h, what do you care whatI do? Go on and beat it.
It's foggy outside.
-What's the trouble?
Feeling sick? -Inside my head feels sick.
Oh, Anna, you think maybe sometime you forgive me, Anna?
-I'll forgive you right now.
-Oh, Anna lilla.
Oh, don't bawI about it.
There ain't nothing to forgive anyway.
It ain't your fault, it ain't mine. It ain't his, neither.
I fix everything all right for you and me, Anna.
Then you and me will stick together?
We'll work for each other and help each other, huh?
-What is it you fixed?
-Well,I sign on steamer Londonderry.
sail for Cape Town tomorrow.
Oh, Anna,I only bring you bad luck.
That's how you fix me, is it?
Well,I think that old devil get me back maybe she leave you alone, then.
Oh, can't you see that you're doing the same thing that you've always done?
Oh, what's the use of talking?
You ain't right.
I'll never blame you anymore.
You forgive me, sure?
SurelyI do.
You ain't to blame.
You're just what you are, like me.
And you, you let me kiss you once again, eh?
-Oh, sure, no hard feelings.
I can't say it, Anna.
I thinkI go lie down, go to sleep.
Oh, that booze, he don't go well, Anna.
I think I'm never going to drink again.
I can't stand this much longer.
What ami waiting for, anyhow, like a darn fool?
-Anna?
-Yes, what do you want?
Don't say it.I know what's in your mind.
Yes, that's whatI was, and that's what I'm going back to.
I'd kill you first. And finish it up.
It's a dog's lifeI been living sinceI found out what you are.
Oh, why don't you leave me alone.
Don't you see I'm licked? What do you want to keep kicking me for?
Don't you deserve the worst I'd say, God forgive you?
All right, maybeI do. But don't rub it in.
Why haven't you done what you said you were going to?
Ship away to the other side of the earth, where you don't have to see me.
You're going away, honest?
I signed on, drunk asI was, and she's sailing tomorrow.
-Where is she going?
Far away?
-Cape Town. lt is at the end of Africa.
That's far for you.
-What's the boat's name?
-The Londonderry.
The Londonderry?
Oh, this is too much.
Faith,I don't blame you for laughing at me.
True, it is the fool of the worldI am to come back to talk to you at all.
What's the use of me talking? What's the use of anything?
Anna....
Anna, ifI could only be believing I was the only man in the world ever you had love for, I could be forgetting the rest, maybe.
Are you trying to accuse me of being in love really in love, with them?
You fool, you.
I've stood enough from you.
Love them, is it?
I hated them,I tell you.
And may God strike me dead, and my mother too, if she was alive if I'm not telling you the honest truth.
Oh, sure, Anna, ifI could only be believing you, now.
Why, Matt, you've got to believe it.
What cani do? What willl do to prove to you I'm not lying?
Anna, would you--?
Would you be willing to swear an oath, a terrible, fearful oath?
Oh, sure,I will, Matt, on anything.
Would you swear on this?
It is a cross given to me by me mother, God rest her soul.
And I'm telling you, it has great power in it.
I wouldn't have the nerve, honest, Matt, if it was a lie.
But it's the truth, andI ain't scared to swear it.
What do you want me to swear? You say it.
Swear I'm the only man in the world ever you felt love for.
I swear it.I swear it by God.
And may the blackest curse of God strike you if you're lying.
And may the blackest curse of God strike me if I'm lying.
Oh, glory be to God, I'm after believing you now.
-Now what's the matter?
-ls it Catholic you are?
-Oh, God pity me.
Sure, it's some devil's treachery in it.
You swearing on a Catholic cross, and you one of the others.
-Well, don't you believe me, Matt?
-Oh, but if it ain't a Catholic you are....
I ain't nothing, Matt.
What's the difference?
Didn't you hear me swear?
I'm afraidI love you, God forgive me, no matter what you are.
I'd be going mad if I'd not be having you.
I'd be killing the world. We'll be wedded this day.
And we'll be happy, the two of us, in spite of the devil.
Well, we gotta have a drink on this, my good man.
-Blast you.
-That's the way to talk.
Oh, Matt, it's time for you two to kiss and make up.
You'll be shipmates on the Londonderry, you know.
-Shipmates? Has himseIf--?
-Aye, and I'm boatswain on her.
The devil!
You'd be shipping away to sea and leaving her alone again, will you?
It's all right, Matt.
That's where he belongs, andI want him to go.
You've gotta go too.
We'll need the money.
And as for me being alone, why, that runs in the family and I'll get used to it.
I'll get a house somewhere and I'll make a regular place for you two to come back.
And now you'll drink and be friends, huh?
-Here's luck to you.
Well, you'll not be lonesome long.
I'll see to that, God willing.
Sure as himself will be having a grandchild riding his foot,I tell you.
-Maybe twins.
-Oh, quit your kidding.
is it any religion at all you have, you and your Anna?
Well, in the old country, we was Lutherans.
Lutherans, is it?
Oh, then I'm damned entirely.
Oh, well, what's the difference?
It is God's will anyhow.
It's queer, you and me shipping on same boat that way.
That ain't right.
It's that funny way old devil sea do her worst dirty tricks.
Aye, is so.
Faith, I'm afraid you've the right of it for once, devil take you.
Why, gee, Matt, you ain't agreeing with him, are you?
Come on.
Here's to the sea, no matter what.
Be a game sport, man. Drink to that.
Fog, fog all time.
You can't tell where you was going.
Only that old devil sea. She knows.
I wonder what's holding them up.
Don't worry about that, Father.
John, did you feed them hounds?
Yes, Grandpa, yes.
Now tighten her up, Son.
She'll take us where we're going.
Yes, but where are we going?
Now, Ma, they're thrashing' that matter out over there now.
Pa, they made you the leader.
Why don't you say where to go?
I'm only leader of the Missourians, Daughter.
There are families here from every state in the Union, I reckon.
Can't be waitin' on 'em forever, Dad. No, Son.
They're holding a powwow over there now.
I'll just step over and see what they got to say.
Well, bless our wild heart.
If it ain't Breck Coleman.
How are you, Zeke?
Where at you been hidin' yourself for the last year, boy?
Been down Santa Fe way, Zeke.
Just drifted in.
And here's Windy Bill.
Looks like you've wintered through in good shape.
Well, Coleman, most times I winter through in fair shape.
This year, when the first grass showed, I'd only put on 60 pounds.
Say, Bascom, he maybe could tell us of a likely stretch of country.
Breck, could you sight us to a second Missouri anywheres out yonder?
But it's a long, tough pull from here.
2,500 mile the way you'd have to go.
No, it's too far off.
No place is too far if it's what we want.
This is a land beyond Oregon.
There ain't no land beyond Oregon, mister.
West of Oregon comes the ocean, way it's been told to me.
This stretch is north of Oregon.
How many people settled on it now?
It's Indian country.
Except for the trappers, never a white man has left his track there.
Only one trading post in that whole country.
Who owns it?
A Missouri trapper owns it.
Hey, mister, will you tell me this... Hey, hey, there.
Since you all elected me the he-coon of this outfit, let me do the talking.
It's everything a Missourian's heart could crave.
There's two snow-capped mountain ranges with peaks lost in the sky.
And between them ranges, men, is a great valley.
Lakes and streams everywhere.
Fish, you ask, and game?
There's salmon swarming' up them rivers thicker than blackbirds in a cane patch.
Friend, will you undertake to lead us to that valley?
I'd like nothin' better, men... But our trails fork here.
I've got business that calls me back down the road Santa Fe way.
What business do you follow, friend?
I'm a trapper.
Well, surely there's fur aplenty out in that land beyond Oregon.
But I gotta kill me a pair of skunks, back apiece on the road to Santa Fe.
Friend, how do you find that valley?
Wellmore here is sending a bull train clear through to old Tom Williams's trading post.
First time it's ever been tried.
String along behind them and, if they make it through, you'll find your valley.
And tell that great white mountain hello for me.
Good-bye, Zeke.
Well, thanks, boy.
Hey, maybe he fed us a fairy tale.
Now don't be a pig, you know.
Howdy, Mrs. Riggs.
Land's sakes!
Well, you sure look fine, Mother Riggs.
It's a long time since I've seen you.
You know, you always was a great hand to wander.
Yeah, I ramble around.
And how are the little twins? Little?
My lands!
Them girls has grown since you seen 'em last.
Mm-hmm. They in the house?
Mildred is.
Elise went down to watch the boat come in.
I reckon I'll saunter in and surprise Mildred.
Oh, you sure will surprise them.
Well, Breck, I sure am glad to see you.
Well, you certainly have doubled in size since last I set eyes on you, Mildred.
You just must see Elise.
I'll surely see her before I leave.
There's the Peensie Bell whistling now.
Ooh, look at the crowd.
Okay. I guess it is important to have everything ready.
I have everything ready.
Well, Miss Cameron, we be landing' in a few minutes.
Got all your outfit together?
Most everything's ready, Captain Hollister.
Listen, why don't you give up this plan and turn back?
Why, there's no place to turn back to.
Why, there isn't a home in all the South that wouldn't welcome the daughter of Colonel Cameron.
But we can hardly become perpetual visitors.
It's a tough proposition, girl, this pioneer life in a savage wilderness.
We realize that, Captain Hollister, but we must keep the family together.
Honey Girl wants to stay with her sister Ruth, doesn't she?
And our brother Dave's almost a man grown.
Ruth is right, Captain.
The Cameron tribe must stick together.
Say, you're just the fella I want to see.
I want to play some more of that shell game.
Have you got any more money?
Oh, sure I got some money.
Where'd you get that?
From my mother-in-law.
She lend it to me, but she don't know it.
Here, I'll meet you below deck.
Get along.
I wait there for you.
Are you still determined to be a sturdy pioneer?
Quite determined, Mr. Thorpe.
I've told you about my plantation in Louisiana.
It must be wonderful.
Miss Cameron, those lands and servants are yours, if you'll take me with them.
Why, I do thank you.
But as I've said before, it's quite impossible.
Good-bye, Mr. Thorpe.
Now, if I win, I'm going to keep it.
But if I lose, I give my mother-in-law half.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Here we are again. Hello, Thorpe.
Well, Gussie, you want to see the elusive little ball under the shells.
Now it's bound to be under one of them.
There's one, there's two, and there's three.
Now we'll shuffle them just a little bit, just to confuse you.
And take your choice.
Now wait, I show you.
Here, I bet you two dollars.
Covered.
I always do that for good luck.
Now wait. I show you.
Ah, you see, Gussie, the hand is faster than the eye.
Better luck next time.
Oh, here. Who wants to buy my mother-in-law's stocking?
Gus!
Oh, there you are. What do you mean by spending my money?
But, Mama, I'm going to give you half.
Give me my money.
Give it to her.
Give me the rest of it.
Why, madam, that's my own money.
That's my money.
No, no, Mama.
Captain, I demand that that man give me my money.
Hand it over.
See, Mama?
Didn't I tell you we would win?
Why, you big loafer!
Spending my life's earnings!
Now, Thorpe, you get off of my boat.
If you set foot on it again, I'll put you in irons and land you at St. Charles on my way back.
Davey, I think I better go find Mrs. Riggs, that lady Captain Hollister told us about.
Come on, Honey Girl. No.
I want to stay here with Davey and watch them unload.
Well, you take good care of her, Davey.
I will.
I'll be right back, Honey Girl.
It's a nice place, ain't it, Mama?
Look at the mud!
Well, listen, Mama, I gonna go see if I can buy a horse.
I carry you over there.
I don't want you to get your feet wet.
Now you stay there.
I bring Abbie over.
Come on, Abbie.
I don't want you to get your shoes all muddy.
That's it. Come on. Here we go.
Oh, stop laughing, will you, Abbie?
Now you wait here.
I bring Mama.
I take you over, Mama.
Come on, Mama. It's...
Here!
But, Mama, I want to carry you across so you won't get your feet wet. You?
I'll cross my own mud.
All right then, Mama, but let me help you.
That's it, Mama.
Okay, step on that board, Mama.
Say, I come right back.
Oh, Gus!
Uh, Mrs. Riggs?
Yes, miss. That's me.
Well, I'm Miss Cameron.
Captain Hollister told me to see you.
Friend of Captain Hollister? Yes, lam.
Now don't tear your pretty dress on them logs.
Oh, it's nice and cool in here out of the sun.
Now you sit down, make yourself easy, and I'll brew you a cup of tea.
Oh, that's awfully nice of you, Mrs. Riggs.
Why, what do you mean by...
Oh, I thought... Oh!
It was thisaway, ma'am, I thought you were someone else.
It was thisaway. I thought you were Elise, ma'am.
Elise?
Just thought I'd surprise her sort of.
Did you indeed?
If you'll light someplace, I'll tell ya.
Oh!
You're as pale as a ghost.
Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Thorpe. Really. I...
But there must be something wrong. Oh, nothing.
Just an unpleasant occurrence.
I'm gonna explain that play.
There's nothing to explain.
But I'm gonna tell you anyhow.
It seems to me you're forcing yourself on this lady.
Is that how it seems to you?
How else can I take it?
It's nothing to me how you take it.
But it matters a heap to me, ma'am, how you understand.
Perhaps not. But if it concerns Miss Cameron, I'll demand an explanation.
Then speak your piece.
Mr. Thorpe, will... Will you please take me to my brother?
I'll be looking for you shortly.
Well, I won't be hard to locate.
Hello, Honey Girl.
Thank you so much, Mr. Thorpe. It's a great pleasure.
Just think.
This wagon will be your home for the next six months.
And after that, a cabin in the wilderness.
My mind is made up, Mr. Thorpe.
We're going with the settlers.
You know my brother David. Yes.
Howdy, DOV!
Hello, Zeke.
Howdy, Bill.
Hey, Jack, I been tellin' you about this here boy Coleman.
He can heave a knife into a mark so big every time.
I'll bet you a buffalo hide he can't heave it into that post back of ya.
Call the bet!
Now here. Show him, boy.
Bless our wild heart!
Oh, I've seen him do it a hundred times, eh, Bill?
That's another buffalo hide you owe me, Jack.
You remember, Bill, that time up, uh, on the Snake River...
Oh, I sure do.
Say, boy, I want to know about old Ben Griswell.
I hear the Indians downed him.
Only it wasn't Injuns downed him. No?
Renegade whites done it.
He'd been wolf in' all winter. Yeah?
Must've had $2,000, $3,000 worth of wolf pelts.
Oh, easy that.
He was hacked up and stuck full of arrows.
Looked like Injun work, all right.
The wolf pelts was gone.
If ever I find them hellhounds, I'll sure make 'em hunt their holes.
Lopez, who's that young buck over there with no hair on his face?
That's, uh, Breck Coleman.
He very quick with his knife.
Oh, where's he come from?
He come from the plains, the mountains.
He live with the Indians.
He can throw a knife through the heart in 20 feet.
He's the best shot in all this country.
He'll know too much for his own good someday.
If old Ben had lived, he'd be going on about 72 now, wouldn't he?
Injuns never done this.
It was renegade whites.
And they've left their mark.
Oh, I'd say I do.
Say, Zeke, who was that he-grizzly that just went by?
Why, that's Red Flack.
He's bullwhackin' for Wellmore.
He's gonna whack Wellmore's train clear through to Oregon.
You reckon you'll ever find out who downed old Ben?
It's just possible that a certain low-down coyote left his sign there.
Well, hello, Coleman.
Howdy, Wellmore.
I'll scout for that bull train after all.
Well, that's a ray of sunshine.
Shake hands afore you change your mind again.
Got a good wagon boss for the trip?
Red Flack.
A burly ruffian, but he can maul the toughest traitor on the plains into a pulp without even working up a sweat.
He can do that, eh?
Flack? Ha!
Why, he likes to do it.
But he can run a bull train.
Here he comes now.
Well, Wellmore, all ready to start?
Likely you two have met before.
I reckon not.
Coleman's gonna scout for the train.
You understand, Flack, that he's to have final say in all matters dealing with the Indians.
Well, who's got the final say about bossing' this bull train?
He understands that you're the wagon boss.
Another thing, another thing...
Am I supposed to be wet nurse to them woodenhead pilgrims a-crossin' the plains?
The more that goes along, the better it is for them and you in case Indians jump ya.
Make it clear to him that I'm wagon boss.
Oh, he understands that, Flack.
He seems to be a right pleasant cuss.
He's a ruffian, but he's a real wagon boss.
Likely he is.
Must've done a big trade in wolf pelts this year.
Yes, we had a big trade with the wolfers.
Flack sell you any of these?
He didn't do any wolfing last winter, I guess.
What outfit did you buy the biggest bunch from?
Fella name of Lopez come in about a month ago with close on to 5,000 dollars' worth.
Lopez,eh?
I guess I don't know him.
I signed him up as a bullwhacker on the train.
You did, eh?
I'll see you next year.
Bring your scalp along back whole.
It certainly is.
I don't know whether they're gonna get through or not...
Windy, I'm gonna scout for that bull train.
Oh, Mr. Cameron, this is Mr. Coleman.
Howdy, Mr. Coleman.
Uh, he can tell you more about that country where you're going, and what kind of an outfit you need than any man around here.
Windy, throw my bags in with yours and Zeke's, will ya?
All right, I'll do.
Tell Zeke I'm going along.
All right, boy.
Mr. Coleman, would you mind looking over my outfit?
Certainly not.
Uh, we'll go have a peek at it.
Right over there, sir.
Honey Girl, it's time for your history lesson, dear.
Now, uh, how many stars in the flag?
How many stripes?
Now, you know better than that.
There's 13.
And what do they stand for?
The 13 original colonies.
Now remember that.
Now, who discovered the Columbia River?
Here's our outfit.
Mr. Coleman, this is my sister Ruth.
Robert Gray.
Honey Girl, it isn't safe to be sitting in a rocking chair, when there are certain persons present.
I think you'll find we have everything.
Plenty of guns?
A rifle and a fowling piece.
How about ammunition?
One thing...
I don't see any barrel.
A barrel?
Yeah, you'll need a water barrel.
There'll be long stretches without water.
I knew we'd forget something.
I'll go get one.
What I was aiming to tell you was this.
When I came in...
The folks right next there had an extra one.
Oh, quick work, son.
Say, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take two barrels.
Suppose you go rustle another one.
I'll do that.
When I came romping into the Riggses' cabin, ma'am...
Oh! Well, that's fine.
Looks like barrels grow on trees around here.
Mr. Cameron, you better tell your sister to change that pretty dress.
She won't get very far in that.
Put on some traveling clothes.
Let's have a peek around here.
We have a trailer, in case we needed...
I like him better than Mr. Thorpe.
Honey Girl, we'll finish your history lesson.
Ah, I know how that is.
Well, you won't...
Thorpe, you get back on the Peensie Bell and make yourself scarce.
If you're here when the boat pulls out, the boys will certainly lead your pony out from under you.
Why, I had no intention of staying.
I'll be on the Peensie Bell when she leaves.
You see that you are.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Well, I try again.
Here.
Up you go. Up.
Oh, you stubborn jackass.
I give you a "yab" in the "yaw."
I bet you "yump." Come on.
Hello there, Gus.
What do you call that thing you got there?
Oh, his name is Jack.
Jack? Oh, yes.
But that's only half of it.
Well, see, he's only a half a horse. Well...
Can't you get him up?
I pull and I pull, but he won't come up. Wait.
I got an idea.
Say, what did you say to him then? Heh!
I told him a joke about my mother-in-law.
Gus! Wait. Shh.
Gus, what have you got there?
This is my new horse.
You bought him? Sure.
Say, ya...
That wasn't me, Mama. No, it was the mule.
That rum's for you and me, eh? Ah, gracias.
Well, if it ain't Bill Thorpe, eh?
I always thought you was hung and planted years back.
No, my time ain't arrived yet, Flack. Yeah.
Though it looks as though it might be drawing close.
Ah, how come?
Well, I've been promised a hanging bee if I don't get out on the Peensie Bell.
And the captain promised me a necktie party if I set foot on the boat.
It appears to me you do your shooting by daylight, with too many people looking on, eh?
Well, long as you can't go and you can't stay, just what do you figure to do about it, eh?
Well, I've always been able to wiggle out.
Appears to me as if you was born to be drowned, eh?
Get rid of that moonshine, and let's get out in the sunshine.
All right, big boy.
Hold your head up.
Yeah, so long, folks.
See you next year.
Are you just as handy with a gun as you was?
I can drive a nail at 30 paces. Yeah.
Well, as long as you can't go, and you can't stay...
Well, that sounds reasonable.
Where do you happen to be headed for?
Well, anyways, it's out there, where there ain't no noose awaiting' for you, eh?
Hello, Breck.
Well, Windy, I trapped him with his jug down at Joe's.
Hey, Windy, here's the last you'll see of civilization for a long time.
That's worth tryin'. Hey!
Back up here, will ya?
I gotta finish that with Windy.
Hey, that's what you get for not drinkin' with me.
I'll drink at your next wedding. Yeah!
Windy, uh...
Do some of them musical things, will you, with your mouth?
Ah, that's old stuff.
Dab, no.
Oh, well.
That's no coyote.
There's the stuff!
Hey, did you ever kill a dead Indian?
No, I never killed a dead one.
Before they was dead, did ya?
You see, the Injuns are my friends.
They taught me all I know about the woods.
They taught me how to follow a trail by watching the leaves. And how to cut your mark on a tree so you won't get lost in the forest.
And they taught me how to burry in in the snow, so you won't freeze to death in the storms.
And they taught me how to make a fire without even a flint.
How could you do that?
And they taught me how to make the best bow and arrows too.
Did they teach you how to make papooses?
No, that's one of their own secrets.
Well, boys, I guess we better get going.
O God, our Father, as you sit on high and look down on us poor mortals, forgive our frailties.
I am about to lead these people into a wild and dangerous country.
Give me strength and wisdom, 0 God, to lead them through.
Where's my steps?
Mama, I got everything packed up in the wagon.
But how can I get into the wagon, you idiot?
Well, look, I show you.
Look, Mama, put your feets up on there.
Now wait. I lift. That's...
Up you go, Mama.
Now one more foot up.
Now up, Mama.
Up, Mama.
Wait, Mama.
You're sitting on my head, Mama.
Get in, folks.
We're goin'.
We're goin' now.
Pull out!
Give us a song!
We're off, boys.
Sam's got a wooden leg below the knee
Sam's got a wooden leg below the knee
I walk there, Useless.
You want these sacks, don't ya?
Trade cattle.
About time we were movin' on. Yeah.
Come on, Willy.
Ah, giddyap!
You make me so tired!
Get over there!
I'm tired of this!
Fi!
Get up here!
Get along here! Get in there!
Howdy, Dave.
Hello, Coleman.
Oh, Miss Cameron... Glad to see you took my advice about saving that pretty dress.
You look so nice in it, it'd be a shame to spoil it.
Looking for anyone in particular?
Honey Girl, a gentleman never comes to a lady's home when he isn't wanted.
Out here, this wagon's our only home.
Pony, that means us.
Come on, Useless.
Come here, Useless.
Hey, there.
Whoa! Wait. Wait.
Get in...
Get in there.
Get in there!
Git!
Wait a minute, Useless.
What do you think of this fella Thorpe?
Ah, I've seen that there squawker somewheres afore.
Can't recollect just where.
He, uh, shoots a kind of a nasty look at you once in a while, boy.
We had a run-in the first day.
You know, he ain't no settler. Nah.
And he ain't no bullwhacker. Uh-uh.
Wonder what he come along for. Aha!
He come along, uh, 'cause of that, uh, Cameron girl.
I'm still mystified, Mr. Thorpe, why you came here instead of returning to your plantation.
I've told you why I came.
I induced Captain Hollister, an old friend of mine, to put back to shore, and I followed you.
Yes, I know that's what you told me. But I'm afraid you're a flatterer. Oh!
On my honor, no.
You got a chew of tobacco?
Hey, Lopez!
Tobacco's gonna be mighty scarce later on.
Boy, I'm goin' back to old Windy Bill and get a slug of "come on."
Your name's Lopez, eh?
Uh, Lopez, that's me.
You and Flack good friends, he tells me.
Ah, Flack and me been friends 12, 15 years.
You were out wolfing together last winter, eh?
Wolfing, she not good business.
No money. Then you didn't get many?
No, not much.
Wellmore said you sold him more furs than any other half dozen outfits.
He must have been talking about someone else.
Not me. Well, no matter.
See you often.
Ah, you rascal.
Got a good bunch of bullwhackers, Flack.
That, uh, Lopez strikes me as a good hand.
Ah, you bet.
Lopez can pound them along.
You and him old friends, eh?
Lopez and me?
I never see'd him till he signed on this trip.
I don't like this man Coleman. Yeah?
If he asks after me, you tell him you never see'd me, till you signed on this trip.
You're too late.
He just speak to me, and I tell him we was old friends.
What do you use under your hat instead of brains?
You need no brains if you got this.
Ahh. Now you're talking sense.
Pick your partner and a-promenade back.
First couple out to the right and follow the ca...
Prepare to promenade back.
First couple out to the right and follow the call.
Now right in circles.
Take your partner and a-promenade back.
Maybe she won't, uh, talk with him, but she'll dance with him, eh?
It's a lovely dance.
On with the next and follow the call.
And a lovely night.
And a lovely girl.
Go in and snag her away from him.
I claim the favor.
With pleasure, Mr. Thorpe.
Well, Zeke.
Hello, boy.
Thorpe just stole my partner and left me dancing with myself.
Say, boy, it just come to me a minute ago, where I seen that there Thorpe before.
Camped on the Cimarron with Flack and Lopez.
Are you sure of that?
Dead certain.
So keep your eye peeled on him, son.
I think I'll go to my wagon.
Let me take you there.
And to think this same moon is shining on my old plantation in Louisiana.
All it needs is a lovely woman to preside there.
Someday you'll find her.
I have found her, Ruth.
Oh, please, Mr. Thorpe.
Look, I've told you before that there can be no happiness without love.
But love will come.
Ruth... I'm really tired, Mr. Thorpe.
Do you mind if I go to bed?
We're getting into dangerous country, Flack...
So I'll be riding to the Pawnee villages to pick up some Injun scouts.
Well, you're likely to lose your scalp out there.
I'll bet you a couple of wolf pelts I bring it back with me.
How long'll you be gone, Coleman?
Three or four days, a week maybe.
Oh, back so soon?
I thought maybe you wouldn't be coming back at all.
And just why did you think that?
Well, after I sort of took the dark-eyed beauty away from you, I thought you might be decamping.
Listen, Thorpe.
I never quit a job in the middle of the road.
Oh, quite so.
But after the girl quit you in the middle of the road...
Say that again, Mr. Thorpe!
I know who you are now, and I know why you quit the Cimarron country too.
Oh, well. No necessity to have quarrels among friends.
You threw too wide a loop.
Remember this, the three of you... I'm not your friend.
Well, you let him scare you stiff.
Only an idiot, you know, presses a quarrel, when the other man has a knife pressed against his middle.
Good excuse.
Wolf pelts, eh?
It doesn't to me, but it does to you.
Where'd you get that notion?
When he mentioned wolf pelts, you looked as though he'd rammed a knife in you.
Not exactly what I'd call a poker face.
Well, what of it?
Only I'm beginning to understand why you don't like Coleman.
Bye, Windy.
And, Zeke, I'll be seeing you in the happy hunting grounds if not before.
Good luck, boy.
Well, Miss Ruth, I got some good news for you.
I'm gonna be away for a while. I'm going scouting'.
Well, isn't that dangerous in the open country?
Lord, no.
I love it... Especially now that it's spring and everything's so happy.
Why, there's trees out there, big, tall pines... Just a-reachin' and a-reachin'... As if they wanted to climb right through the gates of heaven.
And there's brooks, too, with the water smiling all day long.
But the part I like best is the night... Lying out there beneath a blanket of stars, with that old moon smiling down on you.
And every time you look up, there she is, sort of guarding over you, like a mother minding her young.
Sometimes it's so beautiful that I just lie there, listening.
Birds singing, brooks laughing, and the wind sort of crooning through the forest. Like some great organ.
Oh, I've always loved it.
But I reckon I'm gonna be lonely this time.
You know, you can get sort of used to having somebody not like you.
And when they're not around, you miss them not liking you.
That's why I reckon I'm gonna be lonesome.
But I'll be thinking of you.
And you just take care you don't lose your scalp!
Zeke, is he leaving the train?
He's riding out to Pawnee villages.
Well, how far are they?
Oh, nigh on a hundred mile.
Well, isn't that dangerous?
Well, he's likely to lose his scalp afore he gets there. But once in the villages, he's safe.
So don't you worry about him, miss.
Why should I worry about him?
But seemed like as if maybe you was.
No, in course not.
Good night, Zeke.
You got back here at last, eh?
There's plenty of buffalo sign out here, so I'll be riding out to pick up fresh meat.
Ah, well, who's keeping you?
I'll see you at the river crossing.
Thorpe! Pull up here.
You two have been waiting for your chance.
Go out on a buffalo hunt. Me?
Nah.
I kill hundreds of buffalo.
Why should I go?
Ah! Get them cobwebs out of your brain!
He means, Lopez, we might find better game.
Watch him till he leaves the Pawnees, and then give it to him in the back.
Hey, you pilgrims!
Bascom?
Yes. I'll shove the horses and the cattle right on through.
Leave only the wheelers hooked to the wagons.
Once you take to the water... Well, it's every man and critter for hisself, eh?
Mr. Flack.
Mr. Flack, how can I get my mule Useless across?
Well, uh, get your mother-in-law to ride him, eh?
Mr. Bascom.
Mr. Bascom, you know, I don't like that fella.
He's the kind who will pat you on your back to your face, and then laughs in your face behind your back.
And another thing.
If he had a mother-in-law like mine, he would never laugh.
The hunt was a great success.
We bagged our buffalo. Hey.
Did you get your meat, eh?
Well, we'd better shove on off then.
Boots off.
I see you took a bath.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Is there... ls there a slug of whiskey?
No, I left my jug... I hid it in the Camerons' wagon.
By the way, where is my little beauty?
Well, she's, uh... She's somewheres around.
Well, now that you've got her all to yourself, what do you aim to do with her?
I think I'll take her back and settle on my plantation.
Your... Your plantation, eh?
Lopez, he's hollered so much about that there plantation of his, he believes it hisself, eh?
What? The Señor Thorpe, he have no plantation?
Plantation! Ha!
All you got in the world is a dirty deck of cards and a crooked one at that.
Zeke.
Coleman's been gone two days. Yeah.
I've been kinda worried about that myself.
Eagle Tail says last time he seen him, he was headed for the train.
Well, another thing, the Camerons haven't crossed yet.
I better saunter on down there and see what's holdin' 'em, huh?
We'd better help 'em across. Yeah.
Go on.
Well, I think we can...
We were just wondering what had become of you.
Where's your horse?
He stepped in a prairie-dog hole and broke his neck.
Come near breaking' mine too.
I was knocked out for a spell.
Here, I'll put these in your wagon and help you across.
Flack said we could only use the wheelers.
Flack said?
What does he know about water?
He never took a bath in his life.
Shortie!
There's the Cameron wagon.
I'll go greet the little filly.
Greet, eh?
Well, Lopez and me will go greet a jug.
Whoa! You take 'em from here on in, Dave.
It's shallow water.
All right, Breck.
I'll go back and get my saddle.
Giddyap!
Come on, Shortie!
Get up there!
I was just coming over to help you.
We had the best of help. Help?
Who?
What's the matter, Lopez?
Seein' a few ghosts?
Drive on into the corral, Dave.
Come on there!
Pull on up!
I'll be seeing you three later about matters and things.
Why, hello, boy.
Howdy, Zeke.
I suppose a prairie dog shot that hole through your saddle and into your horse, eh?
Natchie!
Who was gone from camp, Zeke?
Thorpe and Lopez come in during the night, and early morning, sent a wagon out for the meat.
Well, a nice mess you made of things.
Two hundred yards running is considerable of a handicap.
Besides, other days are coming.
Well, don't you fool yourself.
Here he is, here he is, here he is.
Flack, the Injuns been sending up smoke signals for several days.
Yes, well, I seen 'em.
I'll skirmish around with the Pawnees for a few miles.
Well, go on.
There ain't no one keeping you!
No, but you'd better keep Thorpe and Lopez here.
I got a feeling that if either one of 'em leaves camp, they'll never come back.
Just the way it sounded.
Hey, look there.
Look there, eh?
Injuns?
Lopez, fire a long shot at 'em.
No fire!
They're Cheyennes.
They want to palaver.
Ah, they look to me as if they're out for harm.
They will be if we take a shot at 'em.
That'll mean war.
I'll go out and palaver with them.
Maybe so you no come back, huh?
Look how queerly his horse is acting. Yeah.
He's riding zigzag.
That's Indian sign that he wants to palaver.
There's the chief riding out to meet him now for a powwow.
How.
This is Black Elk, an old friend of mine.
Do they mean peace or war?
Peace, if as long as we march straight through the Cheyenne country without stopping to settle.
Now that we're gonna be friends, they'll probably bring their families over here to beg.
So feed 'em well and treat 'em right, and we'll have no trouble.
No more trouble now.
Zeke, what's he saying about me?
He says that Coleman wants you for his squaw.
And he says Flack or Thorpe will get you.
Flack or Thorpe?
Why? Yeah.
Well, Flack's got a lot of horses.
Miss Ruth, you shouldn't be riding out here alone like this away from the train.
Because this is dangerous country and anything might happen.
You wouldn't care.
Care?
Why should you care?
Listen, girl, if anything happened to you, it'd be like throwing my heart to the wol...
Oh, what...
It's Black Elk and some of his braves.
Coleman squaw.
Well, he's saying that I'm your squaw.
Seems like that's what he's driving at.
Well, you tell him that you don't want me for your squaw.
I've never told Black Elk a lie yet.
He knows my tongue is straight.
Well, what do you mean?
Well, it wouldn't be true if I told him I didn't want you.
It happens I do.
And you've no better taste than to tell me that before all these savages?
I'd tell you that in front of the whole world.
This silly joke has gone far enough.
Well, there's one down anyway.
Well, there's some more out there.
All right, here we go.
Here she goes!
Get over there.
Hey, there.
Hope we land in no trouble up ahead.
Help them take this stuff, the ones that are going down.
Hold tight.
Ah, you should be fine.
You take Honey Girl from here on down, Dave.
It's a little easier going.
Hold on.
All right, Breck.
Careful of her, Davey.
Now, Miss Ruth, you cling on to me.
Put your arms around my neck, Honey Girl.
A little tighter.
Just a little tighter.
Come on, men.
Let's take some in pairs.
Are you all right, Honey Girl?
It was a pretty bad place, wasn't it, Breck?
Yeah, but I sort of liked it.
Davey, let's see if our wagon's down yet.
Come on, Honey Girl.
Thank you, Breck.
Well, well, well, well!
So I've seen that gal with her arms around your neck at last.
Yeah, but she sure unwrapped them when she got on safe footing'.
You know, she don't care nothin' about me, Zeke.
Well, you can never tell how a woman feels by the way she acts.
They's all riddles, all of 'em, and you just gotta guess 'em.
And no matter which way you guess, you're wrong.
Looks like as if the way they're puttin' some of them outfits over there, they're a-gonna lose 'em.
Let's get out of here afore they get a bead on us.
Zeke, did you hear that terrible crash?
Hear it?
That was your wagon!
Oh. Was my mother-in-law in it? No, she wasn't.
I said, "I am glad."
Lucky for you that I wasn't, you loafing hound.
What you mean?
Because I was with your wife, Sarah, and she gave birth to twins.
Twins? Are they both mine?
Oh, Mama, are they boys or girls?
One of each!
Oh, Zeke, I am a papa.
Mama, I am a papa.
Papa, lam a mama.
I got two for one.
Let's drink to the happy event.
There was two events.
I have two drinks.
Here, give me that jug.
I'll take a pull at that myself.
Well, who'd have guessed it?
If it ain't Breck Coleman.
Howdy, Jim.
Where'd you blow in from, boy?
All the way from the big river.
Flack. How long are we gonna camp here?
Well, just as long as it takes to fix up the outfit.
Yes, sir, that pork is nearly done right now.
Shank me off a snack!
Get out of there.
Fine piece of beef.
Fetch it on over here.
I hate to see you at menial tasks.
If we were only back at my old plantation in Louisiana, you'd have a dozen servants to wait on you.
Let's turn back.
Turn back, Mr. Thorpe? Why... Oh.
Why, I...
Oh, Honey Girl, didn't I tell you to stay away from the fire? And you told me not to be sitting in a rocking chair when Breck Coleman was around.
Hello, Coleman.
You shot these turkeys.
Won't you stay and help us eat them? No.
Uh, I just had supper with the Bascoms.
Sorry, Breck.
Think I'll go hunt up old Zeke.
How many's that for you, Windy?
Number 84.
Well, here comes 85.
I smell turkey a-cookin'.
That's all I got was a smell.
Deal me a hand of them flapjacks.
That's the way it's done, Gussie.
My old arm's giving out.
Now you try it.
I'll get a pail of water.
See, I've saw Zeke do that till he broke his arm.
Yes.
Say, boy, I wouldn't let my mother-in-law boss me around like that.
Stand up to her like a man.
Face her down, boy. Huh.
If it was me, I'd tell her what was on my chest.
You got nothing on your chest but wind!
You old polecat.
I've just been talking with some trappers who've come out of the Southwest.
They say the country they call California is wonderful.
Yes, so I've heard.
Why won't you come with me to a land like that?
Are you going there?
If you'll come with me.
Well, what about your plantation in Louisiana?
Well... If we like California better, we could sell my holdings and buy vast lands out there.
Well, it's... It's a compliment to offer me all that, but it can't be.
I must join Davey.
Dave, come over here.
Black Elk here says that you and your sister were so good to him, when he come in to visit that he wants to give you all them ponies.
Well, that's kind of him, Zeke, but we couldn't take their horses.
Oh, of course you could.
They got hundreds of ponies.
He wants you to show him where to put 'em.
You go and throw them ponies in with your herd.
Why, Zeke, you lyin' old coot. That Injun's buying Cameron's sister for Coleman's squaw.
Well... Well, why not?
So Coleman's buying himself a squaw, eh?
Zeke, you old whiskered Cupid, you!
I loathe the very sight of you!
What have I done now?
You've made me the joke of the plains.
Who else tried to buy me like an Indian squaw?
You put me to shame before them all.
Why, girl, you're imagining things. Oh...
Zeke always told me women were damned funny.
Mr. Thorpe, I've changed my mind.
I'll go with you to California if you'll go at once.
At once?
Why, yes, yes.
Uh, I'll make preparations immediately.
This is a fine state of affairs.
This man Thorpe isn't all he claims to be.
My mind is made up, Davey, and we're going to California.
Where's Flack?
I just came in to tell you good-bye.
Uh, good-bye?
I'm going to take my outfit and leave you here.
Uh, your outfit?
All you got is one horse and two guns.
No, the Cameron outfit's mine now.
Oh, it is, eh?
Yes, we're going to California, so I'll bid you a fond farewell.
No, you ain't! No?
Nah!
Why do you suppose I grubstaked you for, eh?
So far, you've been a fizzle.
One try, one miss.
Oh, he's no longer in my way.
Well, he's in mine.
Well, tear him down yourself.
Oh, I'd like to kick him into pulp.
Oh, I'd like to break him in two like a...
I don't mind fists or feet, or even a gun.
It's the way he throws that knife.
But why should I risk it?
Because you're a dead shot.
You're a-going to stick.
You're a-going to prove how good you are, before you leave the fort.
Well, if you don't... I'll tell that little filly there's a wide-open noose waiting' for you in every river town.
Thorpe, you do your job before you leave the fort.
Howdy, Henry.
How's things, Coleman?
Say, Black Elk was telling me that all the Injuns in the West was gathering to keep you all from passing' through.
Black Elk and the Cheyennes are going west to hold a powwow with the Shoshones.
Yeah, Black Elk tells me that it's almost certain that the Cheyennes will declare war later.
Likely.
Old Pete Rubideaux was asking about you a while ago. Pete?
Where is he?
Camped at the spring yonder with his new squaw.
I think I'll ramble down and see him. Sure.
Say, Henry, will you put a new cap nipple on this gun?
Sure will, boy.
And a new trigger spring in the pistol.
I'll leave 'em with you while I go see Pete.
Be ready when you come back.
We are about to unite this loving and devoted couple in the holy bonds of wedlock.
Hank Ginnis, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Abigail Vance, do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Hey, Flack. Yeah?
You recollect how Coleman done told you that if Lopez here, or Thorpe done strayed off into the brush, they weren't likely as how never come back?
He made some kind of a bluff.
Well, uh, Thorpe strayed out and he ain't a-never comin' back.
He's done gone back to his old plantation.
Well, you won't go to California with Thorpe now.
He and Coleman just met in the brush, and Coleman shot him.
I heard the shot. And I saw Coleman standing there over him.
It suits me too.
So he'll even do murder.
And so I pronounce you man and wife. And may peace and happiness be yours.
A murder? Where?
Where, girl?
Coleman met Mr. Thorpe in the brush and shot him!
That's a serious accusation, my girl.
Are you sure? My brother saw it.
Men, we can't have cold-blooded murderers among us.
There's the man that shot Bill Thorpe down like a dog.
Lopez, go and get a rope.
Get a rope.
Yeah, get the rope!
And just who accuses me of killing Thorpe?
It, uh... It was Miss Cameron.
You, eh?
So you'd like to see me hang.
Listen to me, you.
This boy, Coleman, here just couldn't have killed Thorpe.
'Cause he didn't have no guns on him.
He left his'n with Dutch Henry to be fixed.
Coleman and Thorpe were at odds with the Cameron girl.
If it wasn't Coleman, who was it who shot Thorpe?
Since you're aimin' to know, I'll tell you who done it.
I shot that skunk myself!
Coleman's a friend of his, men.
He's lying to save his neck.
What could Zeke have against a man like Thorpe?
You want to know that too?
Yes, I want to know that too!
Well, I'm a-tellin' ya.
I was camped out pretty close to you, and I heared that powwow you had with Thorpe.
What are you driving at? Just this.
When a man begins to do a lot of talkin' about hangin', he'd better make pretty sure as to who's gonna decorate the end of the rope.
Get my meaning?
Well, Thorpe ain't nothin' to me. It's no affair of mine.
That's just what I was a-thinkin'. Huh.
And Coleman ain't gonna do no scouting, while I'm boss of this train.
I'm leaving him behind.
Coleman would never...
Ah, now, we're taking on a new scout.
Guess again, Flack.
I started with this outfit, and I'll be with it at the finish.
Who says so?
I'm just telling ya.
I got two reasons.
One is I told Wellmore I'd scout the train through.
The other is a little personal business I aim to transact at the end of the trail.
See if you can figure out what that is, Flack.
Coleman, the settlers are willing to push on.
We'll follow you.
What's this talk about Injuns?
It's true. The Injuns are gathering to the westward to stop us from going through.
Injuns have never yet prevented our breed of men from travelin' into the setting' sun.
Well, get your outfits together.
Never mind what you see or what you hear.
Red Flack is still boss of the train.
Get her going!
Let's pull out and follow!
Fall in!
Nag, giddyap!
Get in!
It's no use, men.
She's all dried up.
Hey, them settlers is dyin' off like rats.
We're for moving on.
Come on, Lopez.
Boy, they're scattered back all across the desert.
We gotta gather 'em up and shove 'em along.
Old Charlie died, Coleman.
We raised him from a colt.
Tough, boy.
But we gotta battle it through.
Giddyap, Toby!
Giddyap, Toby!
Giddyap there!
Work 'em on through!
Injun signs!
Pull up there!
Here's your gun, boy!
Get up there.
Don't panic!
Looks like Crows and Cheyennes, Zeke.
Now let's throw it into 'em!
Stop shooting', everybody!
Stop shooting'!
They're ridin' off.
When they wheel back on us, reload it up and give it to 'em!
There they go, boy.
I guess we was just a little too much for 'em.
Father, our good friends have perished here at the hands of the savages.
Open your arms to them and care for our loved ones until we meet again on the other shore.
Well, Zeke... Ol' Windy's gone on another trail.
Windy, you and me was...
Well, you and me was, uh...
Well, Zeke, I'm gonna trail the Injuns and make sure they go back to their villages.
So you scout the train ahead, and I'll pick it up in a week or so.
Bye, Zeke.
Bye, boy.
Giddyap, there!
Giddyap, there!
Giddyap! Get over there!
Get a hold of that wheel!
Tough time!
Lopez! Lopez, get 'em in line!
Hey, sí!
Put the whip to them!
Pull the trailers! Giddyap there!
Get on Up!
Work 'em over!
Get outta there!
Come on, Bob!
Get 'em movin' to the right!
Giddyap, boy!
I wonder how long we'll be bogged down here.
I heard there was three wagons already turned back.
Ma, let's turn back to Missouri!
Me? Turn back because of a little mud?
Say, Uncle, when did Bascom women ever turn back?
Grandma, don't you and Ma know that Pa is only jokin'?
Be powerful on it now.
Go on there, Fanny!
Go on, Meg!
Go on there, Jennie!
Jennie, go on!
Oh, we're stuck.
Gus, you idiot!
You've got my wagon up to the hub in mud!
What are you kickin' about?
I am sitting on my mule.
But don't worry, Mama.
I think it's gonna clear up.
There will be no more rain.
Throw that idiot... Throw that idiot a rope and help him out of there.
Keep in line!
Take the settlers to the right!
Get over here!
Get up in there!
Come over here and hold on.
Giddyap there!
Keep it in line!
Keep it going!
Here, Abbie.
Here's the water.
Mama, I got good news for you.
Ah, you're always bad news to me.
Get on your long underwear quick.
Well, you're going in the snow up to your... Up to your... Your...
Way up, Mama.
And hand me out my bear overcoat.
Well, Useless... You're going someplace you won't want to sit down.
It's so cold, it'll freeze your hooves off.
Think I'll go say howdy to the Camerons.
This is my best overcoat.
Well, I'd hate to see your worst one.
Hello, Gus.
Oh, hello there, Breck.
I'm certainly glad to see you back again.
What are you wearing the heavy overcoat for?
I'm getting all ready for that snow.
No, we won't be there for days.
Well, anyway, I'm going to keep warm by the camp.
Where's the Cameron outfit?
Oh, we left them four or five days back.
Left 'em?
All their horses give out.
They couldn't go on.
Fifteen, 20 wagons.
They all went back to the fort.
I hated to tell ya, son.
Zeke, why did you let the Camerons go? Ah, not my doin', son.
Flack knows I savvy Injun sign, so he sends me on ahead to scout.
And when I come back, they'd all dropped out.
If Injuns chance on those wagons, they'll kill the lot of 'em.
I'm afeard so, Breck boy.
The Way's clear ahead, Zeke. You scout 'em.
I'm going back for the Camerons. Good luck, son!
Giddyap, Jennie!
Well, Useless...
Giddyap, Jennie!
I don't know who smells the worse, you or me.
Go ahead there!
Here we go again.
Pull, Fanny!
I felt someway that you'd come.
I'd have been here a heap sooner if I could've.
Say, Dave, you'd better out off that trailer and throw everything into one wagon.
I'll hitch up Ol' Rhody and we'll see if we can get out of here.
After you left, old Zeke told me the truth about some matters.
Thorpe and Flack and all.
He did, eh?
Sorry I was so stupid.
Oh, don't worry, Miss Ruth.
Things did look sort of queer.
Well, we all get off on the wrong trail once in a while.
We'll make it through all right.
Well, that's fixed.
Can I do something, Breck?
We oughta overtake those settlers in a week or so.
Here you are, Ruthie.
We're goin' again, Davey.
Heave-ho.
Pull 'er there.
Come on there, Shortie.
What did I tell you, huh?
You wouldn't listen to me!
There ain't a man here that knows the pass over them hills!
We're for turning back!
Wait!
Follow me and I'll lead you to that valley that Coleman told us about.
Coleman, huh?
He's the only one that knows the way out, and he's deserted us!
Sure, he quit!
If he was here, I'd shoot him down in his tracks.
Well, Flack, just when you gonna start this shooting'?
You're just in time, Coleman.
Did you find the Camerons?
They're over yonder.
What's the trouble here?
They're turning back.
No, you're not!
We can't turn back.
We're blazing a trail that started in England.
Not even storms of the sea could turn back those first settlers. And they carried it on further.
They blazed it on through the wilderness of Kentucky.
Famine, hunger, not even massacres could stop them.
And now we've picked up the trail again, and nothing can stop us!
Not even the snows of winter nor the peaks of the highest mountains.
We're building a nation!
So we've got to suffer.
No great trail was ever blazed without hardship.
And you've gotta fight!
And when you stop fightin', that's death.
What are you gonna do, lie down and die?
No! Not in a thousand years.
You're going on with me!
The word is said, and we'll follow you.
Be ready to start at sunup!
Well... Well, he's turned up again.
Yeah, well, he'll down the both of us.
You've got to get him tonight.
But they can hear a shot at night.
Well, they can't hear a knife.
They all know this knife of mine.
Well, here's a knife they don't know.
I afraid of that knife. I know where you got it.
Shh, shh, shh, shh!
It will get us in trouble sure.
Because a dead man's knife is bad medicine!
Here, just stop that drivel.
No. Take the knife and wait for tonight.
Wait until he's bedded down, and then...
God bless my sister Ruth and my brother Dave, and make me a good girl, and take care of us.
Aren't you going to ask God to take care of Breck Coleman?
Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman can take care of himself.
You overplayed your hand that time, Lopez!
Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife.
Well, where'd you find it, boy?
Lopez just left it sticking in my bedroll.
Their having it makes it certain that Flack and Lopez did it.
No question about it, boy.
What did they do, Coleman?
Killed my best friend.
I been on their trail ever since.
That's a serious charge.
If you're sure, we'll call a settlers' meeting in the morning to try 'em.
You can call a settlers' meeting to bury 'em.
That I kill my own rats!
They've jumped camp, Zeke, and I'm off on their trail.
Breck, you can't leave us here!
You got to see us through.
He's right, boy.
Maybe so, the way you all look at it.
But those two men killed a man in cold blood, and they've got to pay.
It's not that I've got hatred in my heart, but that I'm the law out here, that's all.
And the law is justice.
Well, Zeke, I'll see 'em to the end of the trail.
But then I'm picking up a new trail here.
Get over!
Get over here!
Hah! Get over! Hah!
Get over! Whoa, hah!
Whoa, hah! Get over! Pull!
Yonder stands the great white mountain. And down below lies the valley I've told you about.
Coleman, you have fulfilled our hopes.
It is fitting that we give thanks to the Almighty.
Our Father, we thank thee for leading us to this land of promise, for guiding our footsteps safely through the dangers of our pilgrimage.
In this valley of our dreams, we'll build our homes and serve thee, O Father. And our children's children shall praise thy name.
The way is clear ahead.
All gentle slopes.
So drive down, my friends, and settle it.
Lead the way.
Zeke will lead the way down.
Our trails fork here.
You mean you are leaving us?
There's a trail I've followed for over 3,000 miles now, and I'm headin' back to pick it up again and follow it to the end.
Coleman, you're the breed of man that would follow a trail to the end.
Thanks, Bascom.
Friends, we'll go on.
Boy, there's two of 'em. Bad ones.
Now, I'm going with you.
No, Zeke.
You stay here and look after Ruth and her outfit.
Breck, you're not leaving.
Yes, Miss Ruth.
I'm pullin' out.
They say you're going to hunt down Flack and Lopez.
That's what I aim to do. But you can't do this awful thing...
Take two lives!
It's frontier justice.
Don't go, Breck.
It's a job I've got to finish.
It doesn't matter about them.
You're everything in the world to me, Breck.
I can't let you go!
The thing has to be done.
Someday... Somewhere... Our trails will cross again.
Now, now.
Come, come, miss.
You mustn't be a-carryin' on thataway.
Now, now, you just mustn't do this, miss.
You'll have me a-blubberin' here pretty soon.
I'm a-tellin' ya that everything is going to be all right.
When spring comes in that valley, he'll be tracking back again.
Now, come, come.
Come on, Ruth.
My legs are froze to the knees.
I can't get up.
Yes, looks as if you're done for, Lopez.
But, Flack, don't go away and leave me, Flack.
Do you think I'm staying here?
Well, then leave me a blanket!
Ah, won't do you no good.
You'll be froze to death in an hour.
Flack!
It may help me. Now get away.
Flack, don't let me die alone!
Stay with me! Flack!
Well, Lopez. It won't be long before you have company.
Yeah, Milt.
I got a hankerin' to trail on down into Mexico.
Old Bill Gillie done told me that them there black-eyed gals is just full of fire.
Zeke?
Zeke, you're not really leaving us?
Yeah, gal, I'm a-pullin' out.
You is all nice and settled now. And this here valley is gettin' altogether too civilized for me.
Whenever I get more than three or four families within a hundred mile of me, I begin to feel kind of crowded.
That's not why you're going, Zeke.
Why else, gal?
Breck has never come back.
You're going out to look for him.
Now, wherever that boy Breck Coleman is at, he's a-lookin' out for hisself.
Now don't you fret about him.
Did you give away all your little puppies?
Why are you looking at that dress?
This is the anniversary of the... The day that the wagon train left from Missouri.
Last time I had this on, I was sitting in the Riggses' cabin.
In a rocking chair?
Yes, Honey Girl.
In a rocking chair.
Zeke, I reckon that's a panther.
It's a two-legged panther.
The only kind whatever gimme that Comanche yell as a signal.
We might just as well start to unpack.
What, ain't you going?
No use of going now.
He's only a bit up in the timber there, and he's a-headed this way.
Zeke, won't you stay over for the anniversary?
Yes, gal, I'll stay. Aw!
And I just recollected, I got a little present for you.
Oh, Zeke, what is it?
Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up.
Where is it, Zeke?
I hid it in the holler of the big tree at the bend of the trail.
Thanks, Zeke.
Breakfast!
These cigars...
everything smells.
It didn't sing anymore, anyway.
"Garbage"
The old man is coming!
Come here!
Erase that!
Well gentlemen, let's see what else you have learned.
Yesterday we left off at Hamlet, Act lll scene 1.
Stop! Wrong!
You can't even pronounce the English article!
Speak after me: "The".
Teeth apart!
Take out your composition books!
What would have happened if...
Mark Anthony hadn't held his oration?
We'll talk about this later!
So you too!
My best student!
Are you not ashamed?
Silence!
- How did you get those photos?
- l don't know. Don't lie to me!
Somebody must have put them in my briefcase.
And you expect me to believe that?
They all hate me because I don't go with them at night.
Don't go where?
Tell me the truth.
They're at the "Blue Angel" every night... with women.
At the "Blue Angel".
Leave now!
We'll talk later!

What in the world are you doing in my bedroom?
So you are... the artist Lola?
You are mistaken, madame! I am Immanuel Rath... professor at the local college!
Then you might at least take off your hat!
What do you want here, anyway?
I am here in official capacity.
You are corrupting my students.
Me? Do you think I'm running a kindergarten?
Now you don't say anything anymore.
You're interrupting the traffic!
What a funny guy!
All this stuff sitting around!
If you behave well, you can stay.
Watch out, daddy! It'll all come down now.
You! I don't want to hear any complaints!
Well? How do you like me now?
God! They're in a hurry.
I wish I knew where my hat... I've quit drinking.
If you don't want to drink, you can leave!
You think I give a damn about "art"?
Shut up! Once and for all!
What fruit are you hanging out with now?
He's a professor at the local college.
A professor?
Doctor Immanuel Rath!
Then we're the perfect team.
Art and science!
Allow me to introduce myself.
Kiepert, director and magician.
I am delighted to meet one of the town's eminent personalities.
- l am here to...
- Make yourself at home.
I'm here... Of course you're here. And I'm delighted.
Why didn't you call me?
Am I the director or not?
An old ox, that's what you are.
Get going with your number!
Don't put on airs.
A splendid woman!
Professor, let me commend you on your taste.
No need to get upset.
We're both men.
I am here because you harbor my students.
- Me?
But we only let... - You miserable liar!
Come here! Stay where you are!
Stop! Stand still!
Where did you leave your hat this time?
All right... please sit down.
And he didn't say anything?
Of course not.
Leave me alone with that English nonsense!
Now he's hurt.
He'll get over it.
You stupid fool!
You ruined the whole number!
The young students are here again.
All right.
But it's the last time. I'll lose my license.
He's coming!
Unrat's coming!
No, no, gentlemen. Not through the bar!
into the basement!
Good evening, Professor! What a pleasant surprise!
Come in, Professor!
You've been expected impatiently.
I knew you'd come back.
They all do.
Madame, in my haste...
And you didn't come because of me at all?
Come, give me your coat.
Pretty eyes, aren't they?
So they're not pretty?
Oh yes, very... very pretty.
Tonight you're not here in official capacity, I assume.
I'm afraid I didn't behave properly last night.
Today you're much nicer.
Professor, send me a postcard when you're there.
What a sight!
Hold still!
Your boys should see you like this.
Let's get back to work!
Actually, you're a pretty handsome man.
You're all right again?
Excuse me, Professor.
Why are there no drinks being served?
That's sailor's wallet is bursting.
So what? Send Guste!
Are you crazy?
He wants you!
I don't do that.
I'm an artist!
What do you say to that?
What ideas this girl has!
Just arrived form Calcutta.
From my cargo!
Let go and get out!
But I haven't done anything.
Your daddy?
How dare you molest this lady?
Do you have a subcription to "this lady"?
Silence!
Miserable procurer!
But Professor, you have no right...
Miserable pimp!
Who do you think you are?
This man ordered champagne!
I'll pay for everything!
Get out! He called me a procurer!
But Captain, don't make such a noise!
You'll have the police at my neck!
Yes, the police.
I'll get the police, you crook!
He wanted to kill me!
It's a long time since people fought over me.
I only did my duty.
Don't get upset, Professor.
Let's have a drink.
May I propose a very special...
Excuse me, Professor, but the police are here.
They mustn't find you here.
I have nothing to hide!
But we do.
They mustn't see you.
I have nothing to hide!
We'll have to open a boarding house in the basement.
The gentleman claims he was assaulted here.
He wanted to kill me... kill me!
Who did?
Where is the rascal?
Arrest this one, officer. He attacked me on the stage!
Sure. Leave me alone with that nonsense.
Where are you hiding, you rascal?
What is it you want?
Come here.
I've finally got you.
Get out of here!
Your time has come!
Get out of here.
Brats!
He wanted to kill me, officer!
Excuse me, Professor...
He insulted me.
This man wants to press charges against you.
Very well!
I will press charges, too!
What do you mean, "press charges"?
Arrest him! - Be quiet!
- Nobody'll make me shut up!
We'll see to that.
Off to the police station!
He tried to kill me.
"Procurer", he called me!
I assume you realize the consequences of this incident for you.
Take that cigarette out of your mouth!
Do you hear me?
What did you come here for?
The same as you, Professor.
You haven't heard the last of this!
Fine job, Professor!
Here, have a drink!
"Garbage" !
Miserable wretches!
You haven't heard the last of this!
For God's sake, what's wrong, Professor?
I'll be all right.
I'm better already.
Those hooligans!
You've chosen a fine profession!
You shouldn't get so upset.
Damn that bell!
The place is half empty already!
Quit complaining!
Who brought the Captain in?
All right, get going!
Come on out, Professor.
And listen. It'll make you feel better.
You gave me quite a punch... but I'm not the kind to bear a grudge.
I'll get you some special medicine from my personal pharmacy.
Put this behind your necktie!
You really think this will help?
Of course!
It'll put some marrow in your bones!
Good?
Now you're presentable again.
- Come on out.
- Why? Don't you want to hear Lola sing?
A mysterious glimmer
A "je-ne-sais-pas-quoi"
Shines always in the eyes ofa beautiful woman
But ifmy eyes at a rendez-vous
Get drawn to his what do they say?
From head to toe l'm programmed forlove
Cause that is my world
And nothing else what can I do?
It is my nature
Ladies and gentlemen! I would like to introduce to you our very special guest for tonight,
Dr. Immanuel Rath,
Professor at the local college!
And nothing else what can I do?
It is my nature I can only love
And nothing else
Men swarm around me
Like moths around the light lfthey get burnt lt's not my fault
"DO right AND FEAR NO ONE"
Morning, Immanuel!
Breakfast, Professor!
Come on, darling. Coffee's getting cold.
Say, sweetheart, do you always snore like this?
I'm afraid I went a little overboard last night.
Bah, that little champagne... You can handle that.
You're a really sweet one.
Delicious!
See? You could have that every day.
Why not?
After all, I'm not married.
I have to go to school.
lmmediately!
There... so you'll think of me.
What's this? No goodbye?
One more kiss.
Yes, yes... Bye.
Watch out for the tram!
Morning, Professor!
Professor!
It smells like garbage in here!
I'll have you all put in jail!
Miserable brats!
Leave the classroom!
into the schoolyard!
We'll see to the rest!
Not without talent.
I can understand quite a bit... but to put one's future on the line for this kind of woman!
I beg your pardon?
You're talking about my future wife!
You're joking!
I'm dead serious.
And I forbid any further comment!
I'm very sorry, but I have to report this matter.
Hurry up.
The train won't wait for us because of you!
Don't you have anything to do?
Why did I ever marry you!
I've asked that myself.
Why are you standing around?
You know the way!
How nice of you to come and say goodbye!
My dear Miss Lola, I...
And those pretty flowers!
Don't make such a sad face.
I'll be back next year.
My dear Miss Lola, I brought you something else.
Will you accept this as a present from me?
And may I at the same time ask for your hand?
Will you marry me?
God, you're so cute!
I hope, my child, you realize the seriousness of this occasion.
Ladies and gentlemen! Do you have to babble all the time?
Here we go again!
My wedding was beautiful, too.
If I had only met you then... maybe I'd be the wife of a Professor now, too. Now I only have this "magician"!
Yes, I am a magician!
He'll do one of his tricks again.
I will now take the liberty to pull a few eggs from under the Professor's nose.
You see my hand is empty!
Here, you can keep it.
Would you give me my small suitcase?
You're hopeless case!
Why did you pack these postcards?
What a stupid question!
We sell them every night.
Not as long as I own a penny!
You never know... Better keep them.
watch out forblondes
There's something special about them You can't see it at first glance
But something is there
A little flirting is alright
But remembershe's a predator watch out forblondes
There's something special about them
How's the business?
Two postcards...
lgnorant bunch!
Who are you to judge them?
You'd do better to shave!
Look at yourself!
No wonder you do poor business!
Don't look at me like that! You're not at the college anymore!
You really should shave.
Who do you think you are, calling them an "ignorant bunch"?
After all, we live off them.
Yes, we live off them...
Leave, if you don't like it.
I will...
I'll go... I can't stand it anymore!
Rather die like a dog somewhere than go on living like this...
Give me my stockings.
Quick, my curling iron!
It's far too hot!
Well, Professor, how are we today?
Havana with sumatra leaf wrap!
You seem to be in an especially good mood today.
I am! I have every reason to be.
But you should be, too. You'll be my number one attraction!
Don't make fun of the old man!
But your husband has become a big shot!
Look at the contract, sealed via telegraph.
At the "Blue Angel"!
- At the "Blue Angel"? - Yes. We're going to your hometown.
There will be a big announcement.
Never! I'll never go back there!
You'll change your mind.
Never!
Yes, you will!
For five years you've lived off this woman... and now that you have the chance to earn a few Marks yourself, the Professor says no.
Leave him alone. He'll go.
We'll leave tomorrow morning. That's it!
Never!
Ask of me what you want but that...
Don't get nervous.
I won't do it! Never!
I'd never thought I'd be crawling back into this hole again.
My establishment... a hole?
My wife! She hasn't changed.
You haven't gotten any slimmer, have you?
You haven't lost much weight, either.
What about you?
The last three weeks were a disaster!
Goodbye, Director.
It's "Goodbye, Master!"
See you, but not in the next ten years, I hope.
Your joint's okay for selling fish, not for a class act like mine.
One more week with him, and I could have closed down.
So many handsome men in one place?
Don't miss your train.
What do you know about love?
Allow me to introduce myself:
Adelbert Mazeppa, strong man.
I'm a man of action. I'll stay because of you!
Not so fast!
We've got plenty of time, haven't we?
I can wait.
Go home quietly.
It's sold out!
There's something special about them You don't see it at first glance
But something's there
But always remember she's a predator watch out forblondes
This evening will determine your whole career.
If everything goes well, you've got it made.
You'll do Berlin, London, New York!
Stop it!
He'll get delusions! We're still at the "Blue Angel".
Don't be a killjoy!
Where's the nose?
You had it!
Who had it?
Don't let him make you nervous.
I felt the same way the first time around.
Shut up for a few minutes, will you?
Chairs... more chairs!
Even the mayor is here!
Then I'll risk a glance, too.
Just don't get nervous, Professor.
We're completely sold out.
Everybody's here:
your colleagues, your students, everybody.
Just don't get nervous, Professor!
No reason to be nervous.
Keep calm!
Look at me, for example!
Now it counts.
When I see a beautiful woman, I go on the offensive.
I'm known for that.
Why do you look at me like that?
Every time I'm in a good mood you try to spoil it!
What's going on here? Bad blood?
Well, that happens in the best families!
Allow me to introduce myself:
Adelbert Mazeppa, strong man.
Why are you still here?
Go out and do your number.
What's wrong with the guy?
Have a drink, my dear colleague!
That never hurts.
The guy's a bit off.
Where are you hiding?
What's wrong with you?
Lola, come down!
I won't go on stage!
Have you gone crazy?
Quitting minutes before the show!
What's the idea?
You don't want to go on stage?
You will go on stage!
Put the wig on!
You don't want to go on stage?
I won't have any of this in my place!
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the delay...
Does someone have a bellyache?
But you'll be compensated generously by the immediate beginning of this truly international number.
As a special feature on this act, I would like to introduce to you a man whom you all know for his pedagogical achievements... at the local college.
Give us the Professor!
I can see you don't need any further introduction...
Of course, I am talking about our most popular Professor Dr. Immanuel Rath!
Come out now!
You'll sabotage the whole number!
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce to you...
August, my apprentice sorcerer.
You can see I'm working without any special tools, just my bare hands.
What you can see here is an ordinary top hat.
With no false bottom, no secret chamber, no trap door.
This top hat... I will put on August's head and instantly conjure up from under it a living dove.
I know you all think the dove has already been put there.
But no. See for yourself. Empty.
All empty!
One more proof.
A dagger...
Ladies and gentlemen, do not become alarmed if you see the gun in my right hand.
See? August has a bird.
This is disgusting!
Call the police!
Mr. Sorcerer, I've run out of eggs... Would you be so kind to conjure some up for me?
Of course.
From under August's nose, I will now conjure up some eggs.
Pull yourself together, August!
You were a professor once!
You all think August has the eggs under his head.
But no!
Right away, ladies and gentlemen.
An egg!
Where's the "Cock-a-doodle-do"?
A genuine egg!
Lay more eggs!
If you don't crow this time, I'll kill you!
An egg!
A genuine egg!
Come on!
Crow!
I'll kill you!
Do your crowing!
What's wrong with you?
What do you want from me?
Was that necessary?
I don't understand you. A fine, well-educated man...
All this because of a woman!
Relax now.
Everything will be all right.
Because that is my world
It is my nature... I can only love
Nothing else
Men swarm around me like moths around the light when they get burnt lt's not my fault
Tom, come on up here and pack this thing. Let's get going.
Okay, I'm gonna put some of these things in your bag.
Can I? Okay.
- Say, Helen?
- Yeah? I have everything packed but my sweater. May I put it in your bag?
You better leave it out.
It's a long ride back.
- It gets cold around midnight.
Oh, we'll make New York by 10:30 if we get started on time.
- Three hearts.
- Five spades.
- Little slam in spades.
- Pass. - I hope you make it.
Your ex-husband says he divorced you because of overbidding.
Well, you take it from me, my ex-husband's ex-wife divorced him because he sang in his bathtub.
You ought to double six spades, Dr. Bernard.
Come on, Dot. Get hot. Step on it.
Loosen up, Dot.
Loosen up. This is a foxtrot, not an Australian crawl.
Looseness is your specialty, not mine.
Open your clubs. Open your clubs.
Hannah, will you attend to your dinner?
It's all ready, if Miss Jerry'd come back with the fish she promised me.
I'll leave you the spades.
Confound that daughter of mine, she and Ted have been gone ages.
Come on, Dot. Put more "uh" into it.
Good gracious, Don. You're dancing with me, not giving me an osteopathic treatment.
Nothing personal, I assure you.
And if you would take your mind off Paul and concentrate more on your own left leg, I think we'd do a lot better.
We make it.
Oh, Doctor, you should've played your queen instead of the ten-spot.
I'm sorry. I can't keep my mind on my cards.
- I'm worried about those two.
- Now, let's see here.
- I wonder could anything be wrong.
Oh, thank goodness, I'm starved.
Hey!
Upstairs, there. Dinner!
Come on down and let's eat.
Will you please stop gazing at that man and come and have some food?
Blow the horn again.
That doesn't sound like Jerry.
Could be Ted.
Oh, now look here. You're taking this thing too seriously.
I'm sure Ted was spectacular in college, but you don't go through life on a lot of touchdowns.
You wait a little while, she'll come to her senses.
I hope you're right, Doctor.
You better come now, Doctor, if you want to get anything.
All right. Come ahead, Paul. Let's have some dinner.
My head's going round like a pin wheel.
My heart's beating like a steam engine.
When did you first start having heart troubles?
From the first moment I met you.
Then why have you been holding out on me?
Well, you see, darling, I'm only a poor newspaper man and we don't make much money.
But from now on, I'm keeping track of the overhead.
And when I've saved enough money, we're going to be married.
You sound as if you were proposing to my grandmother.
What am I going to be doing while you're saving the first million?
Waiting for me.
Waiting isn't my idea of the king of indoor sports.
I've no intention of waiting around for three or four years while you harvest an additional crop of wild oats.
Now see here, darling, I'm not as bad as that.
No, but you're no Saint Anthony.
You're just human, so am I. That's why I don't want to wait.
Jerry, you certainly say it straight.
Sure. Isn't that the way we're going to be?
Straight from the shoulder, open, above board?
Oh, you're a great girl.
And you know, you've got a man's point of view.
That's why we're gonna make a go of it.
Everything equal.
- 75/25.
Shake.
When will you marry me?
- Oh, gracious, no.
- Next week?
- Oh, I couldn't. - What, next month?
Oh, the first, Jerry, huh?
That's three whole, long weeks off.
Oh, please the first, huh?
I won't let you go until you say yes.
Say yes, darling, say yes.
For the love of Mike, lady, say yes so I can get out of here.
You're not eating a thing, Paul.
Buck up, there's nothing to worry about.
I wish you'd have a look for them.
Right-o, Doctor.
I know right where she fishes. It'll only take a minute.
- Well, for the love of Pete.
- No, for the love of Ted.
Where have you been and why?
Remember anything you say will be used against you.
Answer yes or no.
Hope you don't mind?
Would it make any difference whether I do or not?
You rascal.
- I'm simply thrilled.
Hey, customers.
Boy and girl take big leap.
Hear it and weep.
- Sorry, old man.
- It may be possible that...
- Oh, it's all right, let's forget it, Doctor.
Well, aren't you gonna congratulate me, Don?
Ted's the one I'm congratulating.
And to think that you brought us together.
Why, you're not suggesting that your slightly shopworn emotions were ever centered on me, are you?
You're a fascinating wench, Jerry.
- Well, it's too late.
- Never too late to yearn.
You'll never die yearning.
Great Scott, I thought you said a drink.
Oh, it'll do you good.
- A place for the future bride and groom.
- That's awfully sweet of you.
Now, darling, I want you to eat something.
Here. You two have a pickle. It's good for those in love.
You're not ever going to marry, are you?
- Is this a proposition?
No. Why not?
Of course, you haven't a moral to your back, but you're young and good-looking and rich.
Millions for defense but not one cent for alimony.
What a lot of heathen you are!
Oh, Dad, don't let them worry you.
Anyway, Ted and I are gonna be married and stay married, aren't we, darling?
Yes, we're going to stay married.
How unpatriotic.
A man should be willing to lay down more than one wife for his country.
You know what time it is?
We must be on our way.
Got to pack that toothbrush.
Got to take this on the run.
I might stay here and finish this, darling.
I want a great big helping of that.
Well, I'm a big engaged man, you know, I've got to eat.
- Paul, I thought...
- We were just drinking to your happiness.
- Oh, thanks. And I was binding up the wounds.
Never thought of myself, of course.
Wounds?
Why, Paul and I have always been friends.
We're gonna stay friends, aren't we?
I'm afraid so, Jerry.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
Of course you do.
Hey, Romeo, are you packed?
Coming up to finish, Juliet.
I can't let you out of my sight a minute.
Oh, you sweet darling.
Soon you'll be wondering how to get rid of me.
Stop your fooling.
You funny little man.
- Here, time.
- Great!
- Marvelous time, Doc.
- Goodbye. I had a marvelous time.
See you at the wedding.
- Doctor, we had a perfectly grand time.
- I'm awfully glad.
Most marvelous party I ever attended.
- See you in town, Doctor.
You coming with me, Dot?
- Try and get rid of me.
- Yeah, well, come along.
Come on, we gotta get going.
Listen, dear, do you think Paul ought to drive?
Oh, don't be such a crab.
You'd think you were my mother instead of my sister.
See you down the car.
- All right. - Come on, darling.
- There we are.
- Now, Paul.
Hadn't you better let Hank drive?
Oh, say, I'm all right, Mary. I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Is it all right with you, Dot?
- Anything you do is okay with me.
There you are.
- Everything all right, Paul?
- Sure, get aboard, Hank.
- Come on, put your bag in there.
- All right. I'll do that.
Wait a minute, Doctor.
Did you remember to lock the cellar door?
Paul, please be careful.
- Who said careful?
Paul, please drive slower.
Oh, you hear me!
Will you stop?
My God. They've turned over!
Here, come on, boys.
Get my case, there.
Oh, Ted, let me see her.
No, please let me see her.
Oh, God, please don't stop me.
Don't! Dorothy!
Father, she's not...
We must get her to the hospital quick.
No, she's not, she's dead.
Let me see her face.
Mary. Mary, come up here.
Oh, I never thought it'd be so horrible, Jerry.
- Just come away.
Don't look at her. - Oh, I hope she dies.
- Jerry, I hope she dies.
- You don't know what you're saying, Mary.
She was so pretty.
I hope she dies.
You dirty rotten beast!
I told you not to drive.
I tell you, if you've killed my sister, you'll pay for this.
Mary, you don't know what you're saying.
Got drunk, just because Jerry turned you down.
You quitter.
You rotten, rotten quitter. You hear me on this, you'll pay for this.
If you've wrecked my sister's life, I'll make you pay for this.
I'll make you pay for it.
Oh, that rotten beast!
- With this ring...
- With this ring I thee wed.
...I thee wed.
- In the name of the Father and of the Son...
...and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
...and of the Holy Ghost.
God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost. Bless, preserve and keep you.
The place he's heading for, and moreover...
Have you got Mr. Ted's bag packed?
But he has to go, Hannah. It's on business.
Oh, Miss Jerry, if you don't need me anymore, I've got a date to go to the second show with the butcher.
Are his intentions honorable, Hannah?
He just wants to keep a good customer.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Ted.
- Same to you, darling.
I brought you something.
- Go ahead, open it.
- Oh, you darling.
Just to remind you that you married me three years ago today.
Ted, you adorable, extravagant wretch, you.
- You must've robbed a bank.
- No, it belonged to my mother.
- I had it reset for you.
- Oh, it's lovely, darling.
- You like it?
- Mmm. It's to keep your wedding ring company.
You dear.
Will you think of me every time you look at it?
As though I didn't think of you every second of every minute, of every hour, of every day.
You darling.
- Gee, that's slick.
- You really like it, darling, huh?
Did I ever happen to mention what a wonderful girl I think you are?
Well, not for a long time.
I'd like to make love to you till you scream for help.
Can't scream.
Three whole years and I love you more than ever.
That goes double, sweetheart.
And every anniversary is going to be just that much better.
How long are you going to be gone?
Well, not any longer than I can help, sweetheart.
But I'm afraid it'll spoil a week.
I'll miss you like the mischief.
A New York nightingale.
No romance complete without one.
Come on, you're going upstairs.
Where do I go, upstairs?
Yeah, up the stairs.
Thanks, you're too much.
Oh, what a nice baby.
Sure, I go upstairs. Come on, baby.
I'm gonna take you upstairs.
We'll make a nice time.
Ladies and gentlemen, make way for the wild and wicked wop.
Thrills the ladies for nothing at all. From the old country.
He eats them alive.
Hello, Jerry. How are you?
I am the great big lover.
You don't know what...
Oh, what a grand, beautiful baby.
Oh, hi!
All my life I look for such a beautiful bambina.
Hey, you bust up my big moment.
What's the matter you?
Come to me, I am the great, big, Italian lover.
Stop it, now I'm ticklish.
Come to my arms, kiddo. Come to my arms.
Say, I come all to pieces.
What's a matter you?
- Well, you can quit right now.
When he was a child...
Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry.
I forgot all about you.
- I don't know your last name.
- Meredith. Mrs. Dickson Meredith.
- Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Meredith?
- Just a floating grass widow.
Floats them and gets them.
We found her in a little restaurant where we stopped off.
She said she knew Ted and was lonesome, so we brought her along.
Well, she does seem to know you.
You know Bill, Jerry.
Oh, hello, Bill.
You know Bill Baldwin.
- I've heard of him.
- How are you? He owns Arkansas and Texas.
No, no, wait. Only Arkansas.
Listen, everybody.
Silence in the court, please.
I rap for order.
Oh, what a cranium.
I wish to announce on this happy occasion...
How's that?
Because of the excellent example set by our young friends here, I shall, one week from today, go tripping and blushing up the aisle with a gentleman from Arkansas.
Nice work, Bill.
- And me, too.
Well, if we're going anywhere, let's get under way.
I'm sorry, Don, I can't.
I'm taking the late train to Chicago.
- Chicago?
- Yeah, it's just one of those things.
- Business, you know.
- Isn't that a shame?
Jerry's going to be awfully lonesome.
You can celebrate without me.
- Take her along.
- Why, certainly, I'd be only too glad to.
Anyway, darling, we're all going down to the train to see you off.
- Aren't we, kids?
- Sure we are.
- You'll be back for our wedding, Ted? - Well, you bet you.
I wouldn't miss it.
Hey, let's do a little celebrating.
Sweetie, out in the refrigerator...
Well, you know.
Helen, I'm so excited about you getting married.
I'm thrilled to death.
Oh, don't get excited, it's all right.
I'll take them right off.
My Italian blood, she is very excited.
I must sing, that's all. I've got to sing.
Hurry up, Jerry. Get the pennies.
Hurry up, get some more pennies.
Hey, what you do...
Say, what the deuce did you horn in on this party for?
I wanted to see the woman that stood between us.
Do you realize that this is my wedding anniversary?
It's not decent.
Why haven't I heard from you in a month?
- Conscience.
- You're not that old-fashioned, are you?
Now see here, Janice. I was plastered, and you know it.
Oh, but you're not such a sterling character when my arms are around you.
- Be true to me in Chicago?
- Cut it out, Janice.
Cut it...
A little cramped for room, weren't you?
If I could think as fast as that I might have stayed married.
Think of all the fun you'd have missed.
Ted, you have a train to catch.
- I hadn't forgotten, dear.
- Oh, really?
And some guests who are only thirsty.
I'm going to dress.
- That gal's real opposition.
- Well, you're not.
Get that straight.
- Open that door.
- Now, Ted...
- I said open that door.
- Here we are, folks.
- The drought's broken.
Tell Jerry to hurry, will you, dear?
We haven't much time.
Yes, I'll tell her.
She'll be out in a minute.
- Excuse me, Bill.
- You ready, Jerry?
- Just about.
You know, it's a darn shame I've got to get on that train tonight, isn't it?
Yes, Janice and I will both miss you.
Oh, now see here, Jerry.
How do you like this little pose?
Don't you think it's rather fetching?
- Now, what are you driving at?
Except that Janice seemed to be rather enjoying herself when I came into the kitchen just now.
It was something in the way she looked at you that made me want to kill her.
Am I right, Ted?
You know I won't lie to you.
She has a right to look at you any way she likes?
Now see here, Jerry.
But there's no sense in over-playing it.
There's nothing to it.
Come on. Snap out of it.
It isn't the end of the world, darling.
Why gosh, I don't care a snap of my fingers for any woman in the world but you.
If I'd killed somebody, you'd go all the way and back again for me.
I'd ask you to try and forgive me if I thought it was the right thing to do.
But that isn't the point.
Darling, you've got to get a broader look at things, that's all.
Well, you're out in the world doing a man's work.
Was that just a lot of talk about a man's point of view?
Please believe, me, darling.
Doesn't make the slightest difference.
Come on, snap out of it.
Now, pull yourself together.
We're celebrating our third anniversary, aren't we?
All right, Ted, I won't spoil it.
We'll think another time.
We'll do that another time.
What could've happened to those kids?
Here, cut out the private farewells and come on out here.
Don't you realize that we have a lot of catching up to do?
Jerry's awfully upset, Don.
Yes, I know, about your going to Chicago.
Well, never mind. I'll cheer her up.
There's nothing I like better than taking care of lonesome wives who talk exclusively about their husbands.
Come, come. A little cheer for the departing host.
Here you are, Ted.
- Oh, thanks, old boy.
- Not at all.
Oh, sorry to have held up the party.
- Oh, hello.
Here you are, darling.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom.
May they never be less happy than they are at this moment.
- Cheerio.
May we never be less happy than we are at this moment.
Why, Jerry!
- What's the idea? - What did you do that for?
Just an old Spanish custom.
- Come on, everybody, let's go.
- Get my coat, will you, dear?
I always did like saying goodbye to husbands.
Well, I guess we'd better be off.
Well, that's all right.
Here you are, Ted. Here's your hat and coat.
Now, you're sure you have everything packed?
You've got your pajamas, your toothbrush and everything?
Everything set?
Now, hurry up, come on.
Well, well, come on, hurry up, Jerry. We've got to get some business.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Make it quick. Hurry up. That's it, baby.
Porter, how long do we stop at the next station?
Long enough to telephone?
If you ain't gonna talk to nobody too far.
We're supposed to stop there in about six minutes.
- I see. Thanks.
Same old plight I've always had with keyholes.
You stick with me and I'll win this one.
I'm going to invent a key for leaping keyholes.
- Nice of you to bring me home.
- Oh, it's all right, it's all right.
Sorry to be such a nuisance and drag you away.
- Smarty, smarty had a party.
- And everybody stayed but smarty, I know.
Yeah. Sure.
What's the matter with you, Jerry?
I'm just trying to hang onto the marvelous latitude of a man's point of view.
But I find I can't do it and rub elbows with Janice.
- What do you mean, Janice?
- Oh, don't stall, Don.
Ted told me tonight.
And I suppose I'm the last one to find it out.
Listen, how could any man who ever held you in his arms be serious about Janice?
Ted told me that.
Well, how could it?
You're too marvelous.
You're a wonderful girl, Jerry.
But nevertheless, I couldn't stand the party.
Oh, it doesn't mean a thing.
Very funny.
Let me in on the joke.
It doesn't mean a thing, not a thing.
What's the matter with me?
You know, I can't understand it.
Oh, come on now. Pull yourself together.
Oh, now, darling. It doesn't mean a thing.
There.
Hello? Can't you get it?
I know, but keep on trying, will you, please?
I've only got a few minutes, you know.
There, there, there, don't you worry your little head about Janice.
Janice, my hat!
Why, you're the grandest girl.
Most wonderful girl in the world.
Feel better now.
Thanks for being so sympathetic.
Been awfully sweet, Don.
I guess I'm all right now.
You'd better run along like a good fellow.
- Oh, somebody forgot something.
- What's that letter?
- Which one?
There's only one.
Looks like a "J" when it stops dancing.
"J" for Janice.
I wonder why she left that?
She took everything else.
Oh, I've got to get out of here.
This place is haunted.
Come on, Don.
Okay, where do you wanna go?
Oh, anywhere as long as it isn't here and I'm not alone.
I got plenty of places to go and lots of things to do.
We'll go all the places and do all the things.
- You'll upset a perfectly good breakfast. - Oh, I'm sorry.
- I brought you something.
- Oh, how lovely, Ted.
That's sweet of you.
Well, aren't you going to kiss me?
Well, I love you, so why not?
Oh, she had to go to the dentist.
That tooth that's been bothering her for the last eight years.
That's too bad.
Nice trip?
Oh, no, awful nuisance.
A lot of big dinners, and bald heads and double chins.
You know, stupid.
- Oh, this is great, Jerry.
So, why didn't you answer the wires I sent you?
Oh, there was a lot to think about.
And the longer you wait, the more sense you get.
You know, letting things ride the way you did certainly whipped me plenty.
Boy.
You know, I imagined all sorts of receptions when I got home.
- This is great.
- You'll spill it.
Well, believe me, I've done all the spilling I want to do.
- Anything new?
Oh, Helen and Bill are going to get married today.
I suppose we'll have to go to that.
- I'm best man.
And after the wedding tonight, there's going to be a jamboree.
- A get-together of all their friends.
I suppose we'll have to go to that, too.
Well, they'll expect us to.
You know, it was our blissful example that made them do it.
Was there an overtone of sarcasm in that remark, Jerry?
Or am I looking for trouble?
Your cheeriness is amazing.
You're like a little boy that's stolen some jam, been spanked, and kissed, and is happy again.
You know, that's just the way I feel.
You know, Jerry, darling,
I was afraid of my life we wouldn't hurdle this.
Gosh, you'll never know what an awful week I've spent without you.
I can't live without you, Jerry.
I never knew how much I loved you.
Well, for heaven's sake, Jerry, you'll have to make up your mind, you know, one way or the other.
Gosh, I thought you'd already done it.
Ted, let me understand something.
When you say that being unfaithful doesn't mean anything, you mean just that, don't you?
- Well, what I said was...
I remember what you said.
"It doesn't mean a thing."
I wish I could cover up things and forget them, Ted.
- Hello, Jerry?
I've been trying to get in touch with you ever since...
Well, for the last week.
I understand Ted's getting back in town today.
I realize how you feel and I sympathize with all your ideas about truth, honesty and ethics.
I want you to give me your word that you won't say anything to Ted.
- Will you do that?
For heaven's sake. Don't you realize it will be all up with you if you tell Ted?
Well, if you won't consider yourself, will you consider me?
After all, I'm supposed to be his best friend.
Don't hang...
Hello, Jerry?
Oh, Lawson?
Lawson?
- Find out what boats are sailing today.
- Where to, sir?
- I don't care, the further the better.
What were you saying when the telephone rang?
That I've balanced our accounts.
I didn't really intend to, but that's how it is.
Don't look at me like that, Ted.
- You don't mean that, Jerry.
- Who's the man?
- Oh, Ted, don't be conventional.
Who's the man?
Isn't it a rather good time to remember what you said?
- That it doesn't mean a thing?
It can't be true.
Why, I always thought you were the most decent thing in the world.
Can't be true.
Well, it is.
I'm going to work, Ted.
- Ted back from Chicago?
Is he coming tonight?
I haven't seen him since the morning.
What's the idea?
Well, you're a full-fledged married man now.
- You certainly have a fine girl, there.
I hope you'll be very happy.
We're bound to be, aren't we, darling?
Say, let me tell you something.
All you have to do to get a free sandwich here,
- is to wish them health and happiness.
I understand all that.
- I told you they knew me. - Yes, sir.
- Hello, Arkansas.
I'm sorry I'm late, Helen.
Husbands should never be late. No, sir.
You never know who's sitting on the bench waiting to take your place when you fall out of the game.
Oh, don't be silly, Ted.
What made you so late?
- This little hand, you hand it over?
- Oh, pull yourself together, Ted.
"I weep for you," the walrus cried.
"I deeply sympathize."
I bet you haven't had any dinner?
Dinner?
You better have some food, son.
I haven't seen my wife since she welcomed me home this morning.
Have some food first.
- We'll find her later. - No!
- Hi, Ted.
What's the matter, Ted?
- Help yourself, son.
- Help myself, huh?
All right, I'll take the blonde.
Ted. Look at the hero.
Just a fool, that's all.
There isn't a woman in the world worth that.
Love, honor and obey, huh?
Oh, so you're the white-haired boy, huh?
Murderer returns to the scene of his crime.
- Ted, you don't know what you're saying.
But I don't know whether you are or not, but just for luck...
- Ted, stop it.
I'll go through this crowd like a high wind.
- Ted, pull yourself together!
- Get away from me!
Come here, come here.
Get him out!
Does this mean that you're leaving me, Ted?
It's rather apparent, don't you think?
Oh, don't let's make a mess of things like this.
Spoil our happiness.
Happiness?
Don't you think it's a little late to talk about that?
Well, you didn't think of that when...
You're going to put all the blame on me, huh?
Oh, Ted, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Well, listen, I'm not the first man in the world who's made a...
Don't let's talk about men and women.
They do all sorts of things.
We've got to live our own life, dear.
There's so much of it ahead.
I'll never do anything you don't like.
I'll never make you sorry, really.
I'll forgive you anything, dear.
Can't you please forgive me?
When I try to look ahead without you, why, everything goes black.
I love you, dear.
Oh, you'll get along all right.
You've made a pretty good beginning.
Oh, Ted, don't.
We both made a horrible mistake but that doesn't mean we can't try again.
With all our friends laughing at me?
- Laughing at you?
Someplace among the people we know, there's a man.
Maybe men, I don't know.
But from now on, I'll wonder which one.
And how many of them are laughing at me?
Well, couldn't I have said that the day you asked me to marry you?
Supposing I had said,
"No, Ted.
I'm afraid I may meet the women that you've known."
And why not? I waited for you.
But this is entirely different.
All right, then, but tonight I come back here, ready to humiliate myself, beg for your forgiveness.
Ready to forgive you anything because I love you.
And you say that's different?
- You tell me your vanity is hurt?
- Oh, call it anything you like.
Vanity!
I'll never forget that.
Let's not talk anymore about it.
And I thought your heart was breaking like mine.
But instead, you tell me your man's pride can't stand the gaffe.
- Now, wait a minute, Jerry.
Listen... - No, I don't want to listen.
I'm glad I discovered there's more than one man in the world while I'm young and they want me.
Believe me, I'm not missing anything from now on.
I don't doubt it.
Once a woman throws down her fences...
Oh, print it on a motto and hang it where Janice can see it.
- Stop that!
- Oh, loose women, great,
- but not in the home, eh, Ted?
- Cut it, do you hear?
The looser they are, the more they get.
The best in the world.
No responsibility!
Well, my dear, I'm gonna find out how they do it.
So look for me in the future where the prim roses grow and pack your man's pride with the rest.
And from now on, you're the only man in the world that my door is closed to.
Counsel will prepare the decree.
This decree is interlocutory and becomes final in three months.
Congratulations, my darling, you're free.
You're exactly as you were before you were married.
All I need is a complete set of young illusions and an innocent expression.
Oh, cheer up. I had a very good time as an ex-wife.
Why shouldn't you?
- All men are fair game.
- Yes, but I guess there's only one...
I'll show you a flock of them.
Friends of Bill's. They're as rich as mud.
In a year, you'll have forgotten the color of Ted's hair.
- My dear, I know so.
All right, Helen.
From now on, I take all the hurdles, see all the scenery and listen to the band play.
I just want to wish you a happy New Year.
Thank you. Same to you.
Don't let me keep you from your friend.
Oh, I couldn't think of accepting such a valuable gift.
But, my dear, my feeling for you is purely platonic.
Really?
My dear, Jerry.
You American women are so cold.
Are you sure you can tell whether a woman is cold or careful?
I don't understand French, but I know the symptoms of high blood pressure in any language.
By the way, Jerry, I see your husband around quite a lot.
Well, the next time you see him, you tell him I'm still holding my own.
I didn't know you had a husband, Jerry.
I had, but I haven't.
Let's drink to his health, the infernal fool.
When you have grown old, you will be very, very sorry.
I shall most likely push back the gray hair, curse at the wrinkles, and say, "You did not allow the great Ivan to make love to you,
"and now look at you."
Jerry, darling, what you need is a great romance.
Oh, one more would be the death of me.
What are you doing in my train, anyway?
International peace conference at Boston.
Stop off a day or so. It might amuse you, eh?
One, I am, after all, a businesswoman on my way to a convention in Toronto.
And the other reason?
You are much too fascinating.
Jerry, darling, I have madly loved you for a year or so.
What you feel for me is not love. It's the call of the gorilla to its mate.
Funny picture.
Ivan swinging through the tree tops.
Oh, am I cramping your style?
- Oh, you mean you're proposing to me?
Jerry, you are too clever to be provincial. Much too clever.
Do I not interest you?
The last thing any man wants to hear from any woman.
That's a lesson I learned from my husband.
And what you learn at your husband's knee, you never forget.
You shall not amuse yourself with me.
Only the bell saved me.
Porter, will you open the window?
It seems a bit warm in here.
- That's all, ma'am?
- Yes, that's all. Thank you.
Why, Paul.
Come in here!
Oh, it's so long since I've seen you.
You should have a long gray beard.
I just happen to catch a glimpse of you through the door.
Oh, do you know...
Oh, how do you do?
I met you once at the press club.
Well, listen, what are you doing up so late and so far from home?
Oh, you are old friends, eh?
Oh, yes, we're very old friends.
In fact, I'm the man she should've married.
But that would have been not so fortunate for some of us.
Yes, I'd have been particular about some of her friends.
I have so many things to talk over with Paul.
Will you excuse us a few moments, Ivan?
Just a few moments?
Look here, young man.
I've been bumped five times between New Haven and Springfield and it's got to stop.
Rather dangerous playmate, isn't he?
Oh, well, perhaps that's what makes him amusing.
- Paul, I am so glad to see you.
- Then you haven't forgotten me?
In fact, I'm trembling like a leaf.
You bring back so much, so suddenly.
You've been trying to forget quite a lot, haven't you, Jerry?
- Who told you that?
I've been around New York most of the time.
And heard the echo of my misdeeds as I thundered up and down Broadway?
Why haven't I seen you?
I understand several were killed in the rush.
Well, you don't exactly take the veil when your decree is granted, you know.
- So I understand.
- Oh, that sounds disapproving.
What should an ex-wife do?
Spend her days doing good deeds?
Going to bed at night with suitable books?
Great Scott, Jerry. I'm not criticizing.
Why, whatever you do, as far as I'm concerned, is all right, because you do it.
That's sweet of you, Paul.
Where are you bound for?
- Away from New York.
Tomorrow will find me on my boat in some quiet little cove.
No office, no telephone, no neighbors.
It's good for the nerves.
You ought to try something like that, Jerry.
It'd do you good.
Sounds wonderful.
But not for me.
It's too late for that sort of thing.
I've worked too hard and played too hard.
I take my outings in the subway and my exercise in the nightclub.
I belong to the sweet, pure air of 42nd Street and Broadway.
Not you, Jerry. I know better.
Well, don't let's talk about me.
Tell me about Dorothy, Paul.
Well, we're still married.
Oh, just that?
I've heard your name quite often, Jerry.
She knows that I loved you, Jerry.
That I always have and always will.
My dear, you don't mean that.
You're not going to tell me that love is anything lasting.
I've tried to forget that.
Forever and a day, Jerry. And after that.
I've made such a mess of it, Paul.
Forgive me, Jerry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
You brought back so much.
Oh, I... I'm so fed up.
I've made such a wreck of things. Such a good for nothing mess.
Well, what is it, dear. What's the matter?
I'm just dizzy.
Oh, I'm not going to faint, but I'm just...
Jerry, take it easy, please.
Oh, you mustn't let yourself go this way.
Come on, dear. It's all right.
It's all right, Jerry. You're just worn out, you're tired.
It's all right, Jerry.
It's all right, dear.
Oh, listen, old man.
Jerry's pretty tired and she's not feeling well, but I think she'll sleep.
So if I were you, I wouldn't go back.
You assume some rights, do you not?
You are not her guardian.
- No, but you're not going back.
- We shall see.
Good old American custom, eh, minding other people's business?
What sentimental slop!
You are not protecting an innocent girl.
- She is nothing more...
- Why, you...
That's another good old American custom.
There's only supposed to be one person in Drawing Room A, isn't there?
- Well, see that's how it is. Get me?
Did he hurt you, boy?
He's got a kick on him like a Missouri mule.
Oh, how nice it is.
And how much you can shake off with just a little change in environment.
I told you what a couple of weeks would do for you.
- Oh, it's been lovely, Paul.
- It's yours for the rest of your life, Jerry.
Oh, Jerry, I have here the confirmation of my appointment to the Far East from my firm.
You like the idea, don't you?
If I can take you.
There's nothing anywhere without you.
What about Dorothy?
She'll be much happier, Jerry.
Our marriage hasn't meant anything.
She's always bitter and morbid.
Never lets me forget for a minute the accident that disfigured her.
Oh, well, you know.
Poor Dorothy.
It hasn't been easy for you either, has it, dear?
Oh, it's been fair enough, Jerry.
It's just that it hasn't mattered very much, but now things are different.
I have this offer, it's interesting. And most important, I found you.
Dorothy'll give me a divorce.
You and I can be married and...
And we'll be happy.
- You think so, Paul?
- I'm crazy about you, Jerry.
Always have been.
They want me to spend five years in Japan.
You know, we can have a beautiful time.
Leave all our mistakes 7,000 miles behind us.
7,000 miles.
It sounds grand.
We deserve a little happiness, don't you think?
I think you do, Paul.
I think you deserve anything you can get.
Lunch will be ready in just a minute, Miss Jerry.
Good news, Hannah.
- Nice here, eh?
- It's just heaven.
Of course I ain't heard any angels singing, but aside from that...
Well, we've got to eat anyway.
Hey, come on. Don't you know it's 4:00 in the morning?
The night is young and we are practically children.
How about a table for six?
Harry, table for six in the other room.
Right this way, please.
I want four specials and two orders of turkey legs.
Oh, here we are. Right here.
Well, isn't New York a wonderful place?
You go to shows and you see legs. You go to restaurants, and they give you legs. Don't laugh, Joe.
It's a serious matter.
- Well, this is luck.
Well, you old son of a sea cook. I didn't even know you were in New York.
I've been in Europe for the last few months.
Just got back.
Well, you're doing a lot of that sort of thing, aren't you?
How've you been?
Lost my job yesterday.
And I'm nursing a pretty, little hangover today.
- Outside of that, I'm great.
I'll work it out all right.
Say, it seems ages since I've seen you.
Seen any of the old mob?
I suppose you heard about Jerry and me?
Too bad. - Oh, well.
That's life.
Say, I'd like to get together with you, Don.
- How about tomorrow?
Tomorrow? I'm off again tomorrow.
- Canada, for a couple of weeks.
- When I get back.
- Sure, if I'm here.
- Oh, you leaving town?
New York's bad medicine.
A lot of things I want to forget.
I can't seem to do it very well around here.
You see, I keep thinking what a sad, little fellow I am, and brooding over the man that ruined my life.
- What would you do if you found him?
- Kill him, I suppose.
Funny, isn't it, how one girl can be bigger than all the tall buildings?
Well, I'll look you up.
When you get settled, let me know.
I may start and never stop.
That's my specialty.
Well, so long.
So long, Don.
She'll be in any minute now, Miss Helen.
She knows you're here.
- You going to Japan with them, Hannah?
I want to see where the money's gone.
I've gave to foreign missions for the heathen.
How soon are they starting?
Oh, I forget you've been honeymooning so long you don't know anything.
His wife's going to let him loose.
It'll be soon, now.
Miss Jerry's gave up her job.
Really? She's resigned?
And her firm come right back with an offer of $7,500 a year to go to London.
- They have branches in Europe.
- Hooray for Jerry.
Personally, I'd a darn sight rather go to London than to Yokohokohamie.
- Hello there, darling!
Well, globetrotter bride and what have you.
Hello, yourself, you stormy petrel.
It's about time I came back.
Gee whiz, but I'm glad to see you.
Say, I've missed you like the dickens, Helen.
You, getting yourself out of one upheaval into another all the time.
Better be careful, darling. My sea legs are still wobbly.
Now tell me, are you happy?
Bill's a big shot in his way.
He stands without hitching.
Nice and secure, eh?
That other business.
You know, when you stand at the altar with someone you're wild about and the organ makes you dizzy and you say,
"This is heaven and we'll last forever."
Of course, that's gone forever.
- I wish you hadn't said that, Helen.
- But why?
Well, that brings my leaping mind back to its big news.
Big news?
We ran across Ted.
Saw quite a lot of him.
Trying to wreck a fairly good mind and an A-1 body.
He's doing newspaper work, for the time being.
Of course, it won't last.
Ask about me?
My dear, he hates you so hard, I think he's still mad about you.
Oh, no, he's not.
Making a fool of himself, eh?
Oh, well, you know what Americans do in Paris. When they meet someone who speaks American and knows Paris.
Ted was taking bets to see how many nights in succession he could stay drunk without spending a cent for it.
He'd gone six weeks when we started.
You know, Bill's been crazy about him ever since he broke up our wedding party.
It seems in the West where men are so and so, that, that's considered a pretty good piece of work.
Well, anyhow, I've been busting to tell you.
What a girl.
The lad I divorced is married again, has a baby and arrives in Wall Street every morning at 9:00. Helen!
Oh, I guess that's Paul now.
- He'll be delighted to see you, Helen.
- I'll be very glad to see him.
It's Dorothy, Jerry.
Come in, Dorothy.
I suppose I should have called you and made a date.
Well, for heaven's sake, Dorothy.
I hear you've married again.
Yes, a big cattle and horse man.
Thanks for the tea, darling.
Buffalo Bill is waiting.
- I hope I didn't interrupt.
We're at the Ritz, dear.
Why don't you come over and have dinner with us?
Sorry, I have a date for dinner.
Well, Jerry...
If anything happens to your date, dear, come on over.
- Goodbye, Paul, see you later.
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Have some tea, Paul, won't you?
- No, thanks, Jerry.
Well, Dot, what are you doing here?
I just wanted to see Jerry for a few minutes.
What did you want to say to her?
I guess I was going to ask her not to take you from me.
But I've told you that Jerry has no responsibility in the matter, Dot.
I thought that everything was all settled.
And besides, you said that we...
I know I said I'd set you free.
When you told me, my pride revolted at holding you against your will.
But now that I've had time to think it over, I have no pride, Paul.
Maybe our marriage hasn't meant much, but there's nothing at all without it.
It does give me an excuse for living, being married to you.
- There isn't anything else.
- Wait a minute, Dot.
You know that I'm not planning to desert you.
I've made certain definite arrangements to take care of you.
And that's everything in the world I have for you, my dear.
I have a right to a chance at some kind of personal life, haven't I?
Like anyone else?
Well, how about it, Dot?
- Can't we talk afterwards?
I'm afraid she's right, Paul.
I couldn't do it.
I wouldn't dare expect to be happy.
Please, Paul, it hit me.
It brought back something.
Devastation just like this.
Only I deserved it.
Let me say it, Paul.
She married the man she loved.
Every woman does, if she can.
But Dorothy is just trying to hang on.
I see my way. I see it so clearly now, Paul.
I've never given my word and broken it before, except once.
And that was the promise I made on the altar with all my heart and soul.
Jerry I...
This is just a storm.
- I'm terribly sorry.
You've saved us both from a horrible mistake.
This is right, Paul, and in our hearts we've known it, haven't we?
Marriage is the one thing in the world I thought ought to be perfect.
Nothing else is.
And when mine wasn't, I quit.
I don't know whether Ted could ever give me another chance.
But wherever he is, I'm going to find him and find out.
Jerry, if Ted doesn't come here, we'll go over to Zelly's. We may find him there.
We'll wait a while, Hank.
What do you think he'll do when he finds you're in Paris?
Who can tell?
Why, there he is now!
Quite a party.
Jerry, don't you want to talk to him?
- Hank, will you take me over there?
- Why, certainly, Jerry.
Come on, Ted. Come on.
Well, I thought when I put the Atlantic Ocean between us, I wouldn't be seeing you.
You should have found a wider ocean.
Don't you think it would be more Christian if you'd give me a chance to forget you?
Do you still hate me that much, Ted?
Oh, he's not far away.
You do keep track of me, don't you?
That's why I left New York, because I couldn't think of anything else.
I'm still a little groggy, Jerry, but with time out I think I'll be able to finish the game.
You deserve the best in the world, Ted.
There's no one that wishes it for you more than I do.
Sure, I know.
And there's no reason on Earth why we can't still be friends.
I hope that, that other fellow gives you the break you deserve.
I certainly didn't.
Well, here's everything, Jerry.
And happy New Year.
I'm working in London, Ted.
This is the third time I've been in Paris looking for you.
- For me?
You see, I had to leave New York, too.
Couldn't forget that little church and a lot of other things.
You're the only husband I've ever had and ever want.
It's New Year in a minute, Ted.
All the world gets a new chance.
Don't kid me, Jerry.
I'd give my right arm for another chance.
I like that right arm.
How about putting it around me?
Look at that, Karl.
Well, Roy, you seem to like my country.
Like it?
I think it's marvellous.
Say, I wish we were staying here two years instead of just two weeks.
But you know, Karl, it does sound funny hearing you call it "your country. "
I keep forgetting you're not English.
Oh, sometimes I... Well, I feel almost English myself.
After all, you can't be at Oxford three years... without feeling slightly British.
I wish Helen were here.
After all you've said about her, I don't blame you.
Your brother is not coming today, Herr Rutledge?
Oh, yes, he'll be along soon, Gretchen.
Nothing can keep Monte away from this good beer.
Nothing except a good-looking woman.
That brother of yours, he's a naughty boy, but I like him.
He has a way with them, hey, Gretchen?
You, you don't know half of it.
Another conquest for Monte.
I don't know why he wants to mess about with every woman he meets.
Yeah, but you have Helen.
I'm not at all sure.
I'm not half good enough for her.
She must be a wonderful girl.
You'll have to meet her when we get back to Oxford.
- Would you like to see what she looks like? Yes.
I didn't know you had a photograph of her.
Yeah, and neither does Helen.
I took it myself when she wasn't looking.
Stunning, isn't she?
Why, she's marvellous.
Cheerio, you blighters.
Hello, it's Monte.
Meet the countess.
Step up, gents, to the one and only...
Now, Monte, don't, please.
Oh, it's all right.
This little pretzel doesn't understand a word of English. No?
Found her at the museum.
Yeah, she's a work of art, all right.
You should have left her there.
I say, Monte, why do you bring around this sort?
Bring her?
Good heavens, I can't get rid of her.
Go home, will you?
You see, I'm stuck.
Who's the dowager?
That's Helen.
But, of course, that's only a snapshot.
Wait till you meet her.
I say.
This is getting serious.
I've got to get rid of her.
Oh, you know, I have a very important engagement in just 15 minutes.
I say, you chaps, be... be sporting and take her off my hands.
But after all, Monte...
We may be sporting, but we're not feeble-minded.
Well, you can do what you please with her.
Hey, listen, Monte...
Here, just a minute now.
I'll get rid of her.
Please.
Pretty boy, you please me very much.
I am not at home to anyone except my husband.
And he is away on army business.
He will not be home for hours.
So, you see...
But really, I-I say you mustn't think that...
My name is, uh, Rutledge, sir.
You are stopping in Munich?
At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
My seconds will call on you later. But I say you...
There is nothing further to discuss.
Sailing, sailing over the bounding main
Where many a wintry wind shall blow 'ere Jack comes home again
Sailing, sailing England.
Why, we're not going back for 10 days.
What's wrong?
Baron Von Kranz. Who's he?
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
Quite a social success, aren't you?
How do you meet these barons?
Well, unfortunately, I met this one through his wife.
And this means...
A duel.
Can you imagine it?
Running away?
Oh, don't be an ass. Roy.
You don't expect me to go through with a farce like this.
It's the only thing you can do.
Oh, there you go again.
I suppose when a woman's no good and her husband finds it out, I've got to get shot, just because it's the honourable thing to do.
Well, what do you think people will say?
You'll never live it down.
What do I care what people say?
Well, you can talk all you like, Monte, but you can't walk out like this.
Can't I?
Good-bye. See you at Oxford.
Hello, Roy.
Hello, Karl.
Well, what's up?
Where's Monte?
He's gone to England.
But I say...
Herr Rutledge?
Herr Rutledge? Yes?
Von Richter.
Von Schlieben.
We represent Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
Have you chosen your second?
According to custom, we have selected the time and place.
You have the choice of weapons.
What is your choice?
Golden Ave.
Why, that's a famous duelling place near here.
It says at 4:00 tomorrow morning.
4:00 in the morning.
I - I'm sorry, Karl.
I - I lost my temper with one of your officers.
But, Roy...
Say, Karl, do you know how to be a second?
Wait here, Roy.
Good luck, Roy.
Did you ever see a lassie a lassie, a lassie
Did you ever see a lassie go this way and that
Hey, will you cut it out?
Hey, did anybody see my green socks?
Check in the garbage.
Hello there, Roy.
Hello, Elliot.
Glad to see you.
I'm certainly glad to see you back.
And where's your German accent?
Well, I couldn't get it past the Custom officials.
Oh, I say, what have you done to your arm?
Oh, nothing. It's just a little scratch.
I was hunting in Germany.
I'll see you at dinner?
Righto.
Good. See you later.
Why aren't you getting dressed?
Aren't you coming to meet Helen?
Oh, yes, but don't remind me of it.
Don't be foolish.
She expects us for tea. Tea?
Listen, it'll do you good to meet a nice girl.
Oh, well, all right, but first we've gotta get you dressed.
Say, we've gotta get him dressed.
He's going to see his girl.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.
Listen, I've gotta have my shirt!
I... Listen, I'm old enough to dress myself!
Will you cut it out?
Say, listen, will you pl...
Will you... Hey, my green socks!
Is Helen in?
Miss Helen is not at home, sir.
She's expecting us.
Would you care to wait?
Fine reception.
Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
Not Helen.
She's not that sort.
Roy, I feel sick.
I - I think I'd better go.
- Monte, will you sit down?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
I think I'll go to the chemist and get something for it.
- Helen! Oh, terribly sorry.
Mother's fault.
Shopping.
I simply flew My, isn't it hot?
You shouldn't have hurried so.
Oh, but I wanted to.
Roy, you've no right to look so cool.
I'm broiling.
Yes, you are, aren't you?
No, not one.
Well, you're so marvellous, I - I hardly dare.
Oh, silly.
Cigarette, Roy?
I thought your brother was coming.
Went out with a headache.
Extra, extra!
All about the war!
Well, they've done it.
I never thought they would.
I still can't believe it.
Well, it must be true.
It's official.
Oh, shut up. I'm trying to think.
Karl, you won't have to go, will you?
Oh, Roy, I hope not.
Oh, they can't want me.
What use would I be to them?
I couldn't... kill anyone.
They couldn't make me do that, could they, Roy?
Oh, I think it'll all be over in a couple of weeks.
I'm not so sure.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Then suppose England comes in.
Why, Roy, that'd be horrible.
I never could do that.
Why, I love England.
Oh, will you shut up?
Monte, Germany's declared war on France.
Oh. Oh, Roy, how do you spell "ecstatic"?
Special delivery letter for Karl Arnstedt.
What's the matter, Karl?
Someone ill?
May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any information he can give us today.
Our ambassador at Berlin received his passport at 7:00 last evening.
And since 11:00 last night, a state of war has existed between Germany and ourselves.
A seven and a half if you please.
I - I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
Move along, there.
Move along. You'll grow into it.
Come on there.
Give it to him, you bloody fool.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Sleeping sickness?
Here, here. Let go of that gun, you clinging vine.
Let go, do you hear?
God, you're enough to turn a man's stomach.
Hey, you with the fallen arches...
I've enlisted, Monte, in the Royal Flying Corps.
You're a fool, Roy.
How lovely.
My grandfather was in the guard during the Revolution.
Oh, he was? Oh, Roy, you look marvellous in uniform.
Doesn't he?
It's ripping.
Tell me, what have you joined?
The infantry?
No, the Royal Flying Corps.
And all the misery in this world has been caused... by and for capitalism!
Why should we fight this war?
For capitalism?
You will die!
All your sons will die for capitalism!
Down with war! Down with the anarchists.
Get back now.
Who do you think you're shoving?
There's the man I'd like to kiss.
What's the matter?
Afraid of a kiss?
Maybe he's yeller! Go on, you.
Go on and fight for your country.
Slacker!
But really, you don't understand.
I didn't mean to do anything.
Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
You'll never get your wings that way.
How are you?
Oh, boy. Say, listen, that first solo flight certainly is a great thrill.
It certainly felt great.
Wonder who that is out there.
Look at him come out of there.
Look, boys, it's Monte.
Hey, how'd it go, Monte?
Well, tonight's the night, Monte.
Yeah.
Say, listen, be more cheerful. You have a treat in store meeting Helen.
Must be Friday the 13th.
Gee, I-I wonder if she'll wear her canteen uniform.
If she does, you can count me out.
Oh, she looks stunning in it.
Who wants to be stunned?
I'm only going as a favour to you.
You and I don't like the same kind of girls.
Oh, it's a waste of time to polish these.
She'll probably step all over them the first dance anyway.
Safer to sit it out.
Quiet little corner and a have a chat about votes for women.
Hello there.
Hello. Whose window are you warbling under tonight?
Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.
Wash your neck and come along.
Oh, but I haven't been invited.
That's all right.
I'm on the committee. No, I don't think I'll go.
A smart boy.
I wonder where Helen is.
She should be here by this time.
There's she is.
Don't point.
Hello.
Hello, old thing.
You're frightfully late.
I was afraid you weren't coming. Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
Well, that's done at last.
You know, you two have been avoiding each other for weeks.
Helen, may I have this next dance?
What? Oh, of course.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Good evening, Lady Randolph.
I must say, you take your duties on my committee very lightly.
I'm sorry.
Where have you been? You've completely disarranged my program.
There are no end of things to be done.
Helen dear, you don't mind, do you?
Come along, Roy.
Come at once. I'm sorry, Helen.
Uh, Monte, would you take this next dance with Helen?
Oh, how do you do, Monte?
How do you do?
I - I really must go and find, uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
He has something most important to tell me.
Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
Kerrigan? I've never heard of him.
If you must know, I was thinking of Monte.
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him. He's a marvellous dancer.
Well, Monte does all those things well.
Helen.
What? May I?
Oh, hello there.
Come sit down.
You having a better time than you expected, Monte?
Marvellous. Been dancing with a beautiful brunette, name of Eleanor.
Oh, Eleanor Madden.
You don't really think she's beautiful?
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?
I'm not a cat. Yes, you are.
Well, if I'm a kitty, I'm a thirsty kitty.
Roy dear, will you please get me a glass of punch?
Why, of course I will.
No, I'll go, Roy. No, I'm the committee.
You stay here and look after this wallflower.
But really, I...
Oh, if you'd rather not...
Well, I-I didn't mean...
Don't you like wallflowers?
Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
Awfully sorry.
I had no right to. What if I'm glad?
But what about Roy?
Isn't that my business?
I suppose so, but...
Compliments of the committee.
Thanks awfully, Roy. Well, has he been properly charming?
Me? More than charming.
Good for you, Monte.
She loves me.
She blisters you.
It's worth it. Is she worth it?
Depends on who she is.
Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's lost sight of me for a minute.
Roy, you've been neglecting me shamefully.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You see, it's this beastly committee.
Lady Randolph won't let me alone a minute.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Yes, here I am.
Do you mind? Where is that list?
Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
It's about my Canteen Unit.
I must have the queen's signature.
It's so important. My dear, why don't you get into your uniform?
You look so pretty in it.
And, Monte, shouldn't you dance with Mary Blunt?
Yes, why don't you? And, Roy. Roy, will you find Sir John?
I want you to lead the grand dance for me.
And really, there are so many things you've got to do.
Yes. L-I'm terribly sorry.
Uh, back soon.
You see, those girls have been looking for you.
So, you've really joined Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
Rather. Chance of a lifetime.
We go to France in two weeks.
Two weeks? Well, Roy says you're sailing the 15th.
Bored?
Tired. Take me home, Monte.
I've taken a flat in town near Canteen Headquarters.
But, I mean, Roy will be quite upset to find you gone.
That's what he gets for being on committee.
But, really...
Very well. I'll find someone else.
Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
Well, come on then.
Are we here?
Well, it's number 27.
Wanna come up for a cigarette and a drink?
Oh, really, you must be awfully tired.
No, I'm not. Come see my room.
I've only had a place of my own for a week.
What a baby you are.
Alley-oop.
Well, this is jolly.
Sit down and I'll get you a drink.
Say when.
Whoa.
Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?
I'll try to survive.
Well, are you more comfortable now?
Yes, are you?
You know, it seems strange being here like this after hearing Roy rave about you for months.
Does Roy rave?
Oh, rather.
He idolizes you. Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.
It makes me feel guilty.
I can understand his raving now.
You're not a bit like Roy, are you?
Roy's frightfully high-minded.
He doesn't approve of me. He wouldn't approve of me either if he knew what I'm really like.
Doesn't he know?
No. When I'm with Roy, I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
That's caddish, isn't it?
But I can't help it.
I understand.
May I ask you a very personal question?
Yes. Do you love Roy?
Not the way Roy wants me to love him.
Roy's love means marriage and children... and never anyone but Roy.
I couldn't bear that.
I wanna be free. I wanna be gay and have fun.
Life's short, and I wanna live while I'm alive.
I know, that... that's the way I feel too.
I think I'd better go.
Must you?
Cold in here now, isn't it?
Have you a match?
Why so gloomy?
God, I'm rotten.
Well, then you're rotten too.
And Roy worships you.
You!
Well? Don't you make yourself sick...
you and Roy. God, that's funny.
Get out of here!
Don't worry.
I stopped at a... at a bar after I took Helen home.
Oh. How'd you like her?
Oh, she's all right.
Pass in a crowd, eh?
I daresay she would.
Just what do you mean by that?
Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.
Even if it hurts. Yes?
I wouldn't be so idealistic about Helen if I were you.
Well, I... I just wouldn't, that's all.
Never mind crawling.
Listen, Roy, I tell you.
Women are all the same. You look at every woman as a barmaid.
You don't know anything about decent women.
Oh, all right.
You know it all then.
Oh, you've said enough.
Zep overhead!
- South by east.
- Righto!
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Right.
All lights out, sir.
Lights out, quick!
Zeppelin overhead!
Zeppelin overhead! Everybody out!
Hey, come on, Monte.
Zeppelin overhead. Come on, Monte.
What's the matter with you?
We don't all have to go.
Oh, shut up. - Come on.
Hurry up. Come on.
- Be right with you, Elliot.
Come on, Monte.
Get up. Come on.
Let's go. Hurry.
All right.
Karl.
Well, so long there, Tommy.
All right, old chap.
Good luck, Elliot.
Go get 'em, Monte. Good-bye.
Good luck, Roy.
Perfect.
Look, Roy, there she goes.
Hey, Roy, they've hit our motor.
Cut the gas.
We'll burn to death!
Roy! Oh, shut up!
Well, this is a mess, all right.
Yeah, just our luck.
Lucky we weren't both killed.
Well, we're through.
Look at it, Monte.
Roy, it's falling!
Look at that, Roy.
Great, isn't it?
They're done for.
Why the blazes don't you look where you're going, sir?
Isn't it customary to salute one's superior officer?
Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
Make a note of that.
Would you like to try it and find out?
They glisten in the sun.
What the hell you trying to do?
It took me three hours to write that.
You're nothing but a pest anyhow.
Sit down. Oh, don't, Bruce.
You shouldn't smoke so many.
What difference does it make?
You know it's bad for you.
Buy a chocolate, miss.
Change, miss.
That's a good boy.
What a life it would be married to you.
Oh, you don't fancy it?
Beastly.
No smokes.
Think of all the money we'd save.
What would we spend it on?
Oh, a diamond dog collar.
I'd buy a muzzle for you.
You wouldn't spoil my beautiful moustache, would you?
We'd keep that in the parlour under glass.
Oh, hello, Roy.
Roy, I'd like you to meet Captain Redfield.
Lieutenant Rutledge.
Beastly weather.
Yes, isn't it.
- You'll get used to it.
Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.
It's been four whole days.
- Have you been over long?
Everything all right up your way?
Your squadron near here?
Twenty miles up the line.
Twenty miles.
- You chaps have it rather soft, haven't you?
Well, I mean to say being able to dash about the countryside and all that.
Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
Well, why didn't you?
Well, I must be going.
Oh. Don't go.
I think I'd better.
Good-bye, Helen, and don't forget your promise.
Who's that bag of wind?
Would you mind not talking about my friends like that?
Oh, now, Helen, please.
Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
Things haven't been so easy this last week.
Oh, you've been fighting?
Did you shoot down any Boche?
Yes. I managed to get a couple.
Well, there's really nothing much to tell.
Three bars of chocolate, miss.
Oh, Jymes.
Oh, Jymes. Bread, Jymes.
We want bread.
We want bread!
Coming, sir.
Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
Well, put it down.
Well, where's the bread?
Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
Jymes, more bread.
Drown the cockroaches this time.
Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?
I can't say, sir.
It's not soup, it's soap.
I think it's shoe polish.
Cook said the soup was a bit weak tonight.
Maybe you taste the disinfectant in the water, sir.
Well, strike me blind, it's a hair.
Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.
Hello, you chaps.
Hello, Monte.
Still no news of Harry?
Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.
What do you think, Marryat?
You saw it happen.
Is there any chance he got down alive?
The searchlights got him.
We were flying low and they heard us.
We started to climb, but it was too late.
Shrapnel began bursting all around him.
Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
It was awful to see him down there, twisting and diving... crippled, always dropping.
Trying every way to get clear of those lights.
Then another burst got him.
We could hear him screaming...
Stop! I can't stand it.
Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.
You might've got it instead of him.
Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.
We'll all get it.
Isn't there any end to this?
Oh, shut up.
You're always whining.
Shut up yourself.
Who'll make me?
I'll make you.
Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.
All right. What's the matter with you fellas?
Would anybody like to take Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
No more soup.
We need some.
We need some soup.
Splendid, Jymes.
That's what comes from hurrying.
What was dinner before you dropped it, Jymes?
A tasty bit of salmon, sir.
Sewer trout again?
Hasn't the cook anything else?
Well, sir, there's that tin of pork and beans.
No, we don't want that.
Can he do anything with the garbage?
Oh, well, never mind.
We aren't hungry, are we?
Coffee, Jymes.
And, Jymes.
Yes, sir? Don't let anything hurry you.
Drinking again?
You dirty louse!
Hey, Baldy.
The sooner you get shot down, the better.
Baldy, darling.
Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
Monte!
Attention.
The following officers will report for night patrol.
Drayton.
Fuller.
Here, sir.
Not an old bald-headed man like me up there in the cold, cold air.
Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.
Neville.
Monte Rutledge.
I don't feel very well tonight, sir.
That's all right, boy.
None of us feel well.
I think I do, Rutledge.
But I say, sir.
Th-There seems to be something the matter with me.
I know what's the matter with him.
He's yellow. Oh, shut up.
Oh, let's say it.
Didn't Harry go west last night because he took this man's place?
Keep quiet, Jack.
I will not keep quiet.
He's yellow and we all know it.
That's a lie!
I'm not yellow. I can see things as they are, that's all.
I'm sick of this rotten business.
You fools.
Why do you let them kill you like this?
Patriotism.
Duty. Are you mad?
Can't you see they're just words?
Words coined by politicians and profiteers to trick you into fighting for them.
What's a word compared with life...
the only life you've got.
I'll give 'em a word.
That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.
Yellow, am I?
You're the ones that are yellow.
I've got guts to say what I think.
You're afraid to say it.
So afraid to be called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.
You poor, stupid fools.
Oh, Monte.
Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
Stand up, Rutledge!
I've taken a lot of shirking from you since we came out here, but this is a bit too much.
Sir, he really is ill.
You're a disgrace to your squadron.
Go to your quarters.
You don't think I'm yellow, do you, Roy?
You're just more sensitive than the rest of us.
Well, stop thinking about it.
Haven't I been up twice on the night patrol?
I'm trying to do my share.
Of course you are now.
You... You must be pretty well fed up with me after all this.
Oh, that's rot. I
- I'm not yellow. I'm not! Oh, now, Monte.
Come on.
Pull yourself together.
Staff Colonel.
Come on, Monte.
Stand easy.
Well, men, I don't like what I have to say, but let's face it, you all know the central munitions dump at Spraug.
You've tried three times to bomb that depot without success.
No fault of yours, of course, they've guarded it too closely.
That munitions depot at Spraug must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
Now, then, today a German bombing plane was forced down within our lines.
We were lucky enough to capture it before they had a chance to destroy it.
We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
We want to use this plane to bomb the Spraug depot.
There's no question that the venture will succeed this time.
The enemy won't suspect one of their own planes until after the depot is bombed.
Then when they discover the trick, well, you you may have a little difficulty in getting back.
I need two men to fly this plane.
Are you sure you wanna go? Quite sure, sir.
I'll go with him, sir.
Who are these men?
Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge, sir.
Brothers, eh?
Now, young men, I want you to realize how important this is.
The Seventh Brigade has been ordered to go over the top in a surprise attack tomorrow evening at dusk.
The brigade doesn't know it, but I - I'm afraid they're going to be slaughtered.
There's too much artillery in front of us.
If you destroy that munitions depot early tomorrow morning, it will weaken the enemy artillery, and we may be able to get through.
Hundreds of lives depend on you.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Now, another thing.
The plane you are to fly... is far too dangerous a piece of armament to let the enemy recapture it.
It must return or be destroyed.
If you were captured, you'd be shot as spies anyway.
Baldy.
Oh, Baldy?
You'll take the morning patrol in towards Spraug as far as you can.
You might possibly help them get back.
You'll get your maps and final instructions just before taking off.
Report to the field at 3:00 a. m. Until then, let them do as they please.
- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.
- Yes, sir. Good luck.
- What time is it, Monte?
- Ten past 9:00.
Helen's canteen closes at 10:00. We've just enough time to get there.
- Do you think they'll let us have the motorcycle?
- Why, of course. We're "it" tonight.
We're "it" all right.
Not sorry, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm not even gonna think about it until 3:00.
What's your program? Wine, women and song?
Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight.
- See you at Grosson's?
- Either there or at Jacques across the street.
- Wherever you hear the most noise.
- Don't you wanna come in with me to see Helen?
Oh, I better not.
She's gone out.
Oh. Was she expecting you?
Would you care to leave a note?
Yes, I think I will.
Pen and ink on the table.
You'll see that she gets this?
She isn't in.
That's tough.
Wanna come along with me?
Where to? Grosson's.
Your switch on?
Will you close it a little?
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.
Old solemn Roy himself.
Sit on the floor and hang your legs over.
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.
Who asked you to this party anyway?
Helen, let me take you home.
I'm having a marvellous time.
I was until you came in.
I advise you to get out before you're kicked out.
Keep your... Keep your filthy hands off of my girl.
Your girl. You fool.
I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth.
You're nothing to me. Nothing.
Come on, Roy.
Let's get out of here.
Come on. Oh, let's have it out.
I never had any fun with you anyway.
You and your high ideals.
You're too good to live.
You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.
You make me sick, do you hear?
Now, get out here.
I hate the sight of you!
Come on, Roy.
Let's go across the street.
Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby.
Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh?
Oh, baby.
Hello, Chèri.
Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.
Is your friend sick?
Drink up, Roy.
You just don't know anything about women.
I've been telling you that for years.
Maybe you'll believe me now.
- Oh, Helen's not that sort.
- It's the war.
- You're wrong, Roy.
War doesn't change people. It's...
It's like getting drunk.
It brings out what people really are.
You can't make me believe Helen was like that before.
Well, she was.
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
Don't take it so hard.
She isn't worth it.
- I suppose you're right.
Listen, Roy, never love a woman.
Just make love to her.
You see, like this.
Oh! What you do, baby?
All wet!
No, no, no, no! Imbecile!
Voilà. Hey, listen, Monte.
Monte. Go easy.
We gotta go up at 3:00.
Oh, listen, Roy.
To hell with this 3:00 business.
To hell with it.
Say, you're crazy, Monte.
We can't get out of it now.
Oh, why can't we?
Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere.
You tried it on Helen and what happened?
You got a kick in the face.
You can't go through life thinking the way you do.
People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did.
- It's beginning to look as though you're right.
I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3:00 business too.
This is another thing entirely, Monte.
They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all.
It's chaps like you that are meat for them.
All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it.
Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go?
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?
Listen, tell 'em... tell 'em the motorcycle broke down.
Tell 'em anything.
What do you say, Roy?
Come on, old ooh-la-la.
Oh, no, no, no, Chèri.
Oh, oui, oui, madam. Oh, baby.
Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.
Yes, I am and so are you.
Who says I am? Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly.
There's no way out of this and we know it.
Come on, Monte.
Come on, old ooh-la-la.
Monte. Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up.
Why, that's desertion, Monte.
They shoot people for that.
I suppose you're right. Oh, no, no, no, no.
Monte. What a pair of fools we are.
Easy, now.
Look out for the firing pin.
Contactor.
Ground speed here.
Keep this site trained on the target.
Then pull the release when you hit the stop.
Don't forget the leveller.
Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds.
Roy, the depot.
Roy, look there!
They've seen us. They're coming on.
For Christ's sake.
Hey, Roy, look.
They hit our right motor.
It's our squadrons.
They're coming!
Roy, they've gone.
Son of a Boche.
It's me!
It's old Baldy. Hey!
Baldy.
It's Baldy.
Look, Roy.
You see that guy?
See that?
Hey, look. He's got him.
He's got him.
They've changed around.
Our strut's gone.
Roy, he got us! Roy!
Go down!
One more for Baldy!
No more control?
Pull her up!
Oh, my God! We're on fire!
We're burning!
Roy, get down!
Do something!
Ah, so.
It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?
And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr?
It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me.
There are a few questions I must ask you.
If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you.
To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?
Just why were you sent to bomb that munitions depot this morning?
It was our natural target.
But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh?
We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk.
Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made?
Oh, you are stupid not to tell.
For you the war is over, nicht wahr?
Listen, if you tell me, I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war.
It's near Munich.
Far away from all this.
You will have every comfort.
So, you see?
It can be easy for you.
So, you will not tell?
Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform.
Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?
And you know what happens to spies?
I think you two friends had better talk it over.
I will give you 15 minutes.
If you change your mind and tell, good.
If not, you will be shot.
Do you think he was bluffing?
No, he wasn't bluffing.
He's the man I was to fight that duel with.
Quite a coincidence.
He's got it in for me.
Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time.
The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte.
Roy, look.
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.
God, what nerve.
Roy. Roy, I can't face it.
I'm going to tell.
Don't be a fool, Monte.
Do you realize what it would mean if we told?
It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over.
But, Monte, you can't.
To hell with your heroic stuff.
I'm not gonna be shot down like that.
You're all upset.
I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything.
I - I'll come with you.
No. You said he's got it in for you.
Now, let me do it alone.
Tell the general I'm ready to talk. Good.
Come.
So, you have changed your mind?
My friend will never tell, but I wanna live.
You are very wise.
Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men.
I'll tell only on one condition.
Ah, so, a condition.
If I give this information, my friend will know it.
Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor. You leave that to me.
Why not let me have that satisfaction?
One does not kill a friend.
He stole the girl I love and I hate him.
Huh. History repeats itself.
You make rather hard terms.
I'll tell only on that condition.
Give me two to make sure.
A good soldier will need only one.
He will give you the bullet outside.
I didn't tell, Monte.
Has he changed his mind?
No. Don't you think you can go through with it now?
It won't even hurt.
It'll all be over in a second.
We can stand anything for a second.
No, no, Roy.
L-I can't do it.
Listen, Monte.
We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.
Three thousand men, and they all want to live too.
You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?
That's not my business.
I didn't get them into this mess.
Let 'em take care of themselves.
They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway.
I wanna live.
Live! You won't tell, I'll tell.
Listen, Monte!
I'll tell! I'll tell!
I'll tell everything I know.
The brigade is moving up. They're going to attack...
Don't cry, Roy.
It was the only thing you could do.
The brigade, Roy.
Yes, Monte?
They'll be all right now, won't they?
It's the general.
You thought we'd tell, didn't you?
Good old Roy.
You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all.
Roy.
Yes?
Where are you? Don't go away, Roy.
I'm here, Monte.
Can't you feel me holding you?
Hello, Karl.
Cold up here in the night patrol.
Awful to be in the dark.
Look out.
Look out!
We're falling!
We're going to crash! Do something, Roy!
It's all right, Monte.
Monte? It's all right.
You heard what my brother said.
I'll never tell you anything.
I'll be with you in just a minute, Monte.
Come on, you Seventh Brigade. We got 'em now.
Now listen here, fat-head
We're back home again and that's because we did a little fighting
And I know what you're thinking
You're thinking:
Well, here comes us
The Foreign Legion
Each man a hero all the booze in the world made for us and the women thrown in
this time, you're gonna behave yourselves like gentlemen even if it'll kill you
Yes, I'm talking to you you heard what I said!
Why don't you get back in line?
What are doing with your fingers?
- Nothing... yet - get in there
- all packed up, Sir. ready to land
I hope I haven't forgotten anything.
Merci, Monsieur.
you're very kind
Your first voyage to Morocco?
I make the trip quite often.
perhaps I can be of some service?
I'd be happy to help you
I won't need any help
You can always reach me at this address, Mademoiselle.
- Good evening, Officer - evening
Do you know who that woman is?
A vaudeville actress probably just how do you figure that?
we can't even remember a day
We call them suicide passengers.
One-way ticket.
they never return.
well the wanderer returns.
Alexander, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine, M. La Bessière.
- a citizen of the world - very happy
- You're a Frenchman, aren't you?
- Mrs. Marten.
- Aren't you the painter La Bessière?
- I paint when I find the time.
- He has all the time that he needs.
He would be a great painter if he were not so rich.
Colonel Buchard.
- Colonel.
- Charmed - Won't you join us?
I'd love to, but isn't that César and his wife?
- see you later
Habib efendi be self being the house day
It's awfully nice to see you in Morocco again.
- I'm very happy to meet you, even in this heat.
- yes it is hot.
- and you Mme César?
how have you been?
- I've been bored.
I feel greatly flattered.
your rich friend is very democratic
He can afford to be.
he's always chosen his own friends as a young vicar with the captain in the German air-force before joining the legion
- And perhaps you can give me the history of his wife?
- The less said about that, the better.
The house is packed
the house is packed!
This is a great night for you.
If you make a hit, you can stay here as long as you like.
now, you may have heard of me in Europe or not.
my house is patronized by the finest society in Morocco.
pick yourself a protector
It will give us prestige.
An officer in the legion.
They will tell you that the officers in the legion are not important.
that the common legionnaire is the thing
They will tell you that Private so-and-so is a Russian Prince or an ex-General who joined the legion to forget his past.
The private in the Legion is a no bargain with 75 centimes per day.
Pick the officers!
it is no small task, as you know... to supply my establishment with new talent.
For some reason, the artists I engage don't last very long.
It may be the heat.
I pay the highest wages in Africa.
Mille grazie, signore e signori.
Anyway, I'll open the program tonight with Mlle Amy Jolly, a newcomer whom I hope you will receive with your usual discriminating kindness
If I remember correctly, this audience shows its usual discriminating kindness by receiving its newcomers rather unpleasantly.
sit down, go ahead.
lorsque tout est fini quand se meurt votre beau rêve pourqoui pleurer les jours en pluie, regretter les chances parties?

We meet once more, monsieur
I didn't anticipate this pleasure so soon.
can I also have an apple?
- but I have no change for that.
- I hardly expected you to have.
You are again very kind.
Mademoiselle, may I have the honour of your company after the performance?
I have disposed for the rest of the evening.
- some other time perhaps?

An apple, Monsieur?
Don't waste your time down there.
There's no money in the pit!

Thanks for the flower, Mademoiselle.

Lend me 20 francs
That makes 60
Two weeks pay is a lot of money for an apple.
You can have it for nothing if you like.

I always pay for what I get.
I'd sit down if I were you.
You're pretty brave with women
Don't you like brave men?
Your change soldier

Tom, I must see you tonight?
what do you mean tonight?
what if your husband sees you tonight?
He isn't going to see me isn't he?

César's wife is above suspicion.
You may know something about ancient history, but I know something about husbands.
Were you expecting someone else?
too hot.

You made this place look very nice
It looks different now.
how do you know?
have you been here before?
Well, I have been stationed in this town for a long time.

Well, to you
You can smell the desert tonight.
Hot, isn't it?
faded
You can go now, soldier.
you won't have any trouble getting rid of me nothing like independence, isn't there?
well maybe I am independent.
With women
You evidently don't think much of women
I tell you lady, it's their fault, not mine
been in the legion very long?
almost three years
Three years seems like 300 you sound tired of life
I don't know whether I am or not
I was when I joined this outfit how about you, Mademoiselle?
Been on the stage very long? Long enough.
- tired of it?
- no
You've a lot of pictures of that man.
Is he your husband?
husband?
I never found a man good enough for that.
that's just how I fell about women.
how long ago was that picture taken?
that looks like a Russian sable.
that coat's worth a load of shades.
Do you still have it?
don't be absurd.
if I still had that coat I wouldn't be here
What in the name of ten thousand purples did you come to a country like this for, anyway?
I understand that men are never asked why they enter the Foreign Legion.
They never asked me and if they had I wouldn't have told.
When I crashed the legion I ditched the past.
There's a Foreign Legion of women, too.
but we have no uniforms no flags
and no medals, when we are brave
No wound stripes when we are hurt
Look here, is there anything I can do to help you?
I've heard that before.
Or do you think you can restore my faith in men?
not me you've got the wrong man for that
anybody who has faith in me is a sucker
You'd better go now
I'm beginning like you.
I've said to women about everything a man can say.
I'm gonna to tell you something I've never told a woman before.
I wish I'd met you 10 years ago.
And thanks
well, the night's still young
There's your key, lady.
If I were you I wouldn't hand it around.
I hear something
taking a walk?
To get some fresh air?
No, I was looking for you
It's good that you found me.
This quarter isn't safe at night.
I'd better take you home
- No, I wish I were
I only feel so light to you because your arms are so powerful.
well, we'll get along a bit better this time
you'd better come here, there's gonna be trouble
I give you one more chance:
Who were those two women?
get your knee out of my hip!
Do you think the two women you are trying to protect are worth it?
well I think one of them is.
mon Adjudant, M. La Bessière is here to take you to his club.
ask him to wait.
I'll be through in a minute.
no, let him come in.
entrez, Monsieur
- I didn't know that the military was quite so busy.
- Oh yes, we are busy
perhaps you can learn something about this country which you think is so marvellous
got a match?
This little matter also involves someone you're interested in.
I'm properly curious bring in that woman
Mademoiselle, I think you know M. La Bessière
- very happy to meet you again, Mademoiselle.
- sit down
I'm happy to meet you again.
It's so nice of you to have come, Mademoiselle.
You were present at this affair at which the prisoner with his customary bravery severely wounded two helpless natives
Those natives were not helpless.
Who was the other woman?
I'd like to know, too
do sit down
The curious part of this is
I'm the only one that really seems to know who this other woman is
If you do know, you'd better keep it to yourself
Captain César, don't lose your temper
Return the prisoner to the guard-house
I appreciate your attempt to keep the name of my wife out of this
that's alright, sir
You may go now, Mademoiselle
I'll join you in a minute
You look charming this morning
What will they do to him?
personally I shouldn't care to have Adjudant César as an enemy.
I seem to have the unhappy faculty of bringing trouble wherever I go
Nonsense you know, I carry some weight with César.
possibly I can help you.
Every time a man has helped me there's been a price.
My price?
I haven't got much more
shall we go?
Here, take your pass.
door's right open and you can do what you like.
'til 7 o'clock in the morning.
- What's the idea of all this?
- you're leaving for Amalfa-Pass tomorrow - not me, I'm beginning to like this town.
Tell César, I'm not going you tell him yourself, he's going along this time.
- Who's going along?
- you heard what I said César is going along this time
So that's what it is.
that's why he didn't recommend a court martial.
He's gonna get me out on the road and face me in the proper direction.
well you got a gun with you, haven't you.
you can't get away with murder all your life that's right, Sergeant.
your argument is perfectly sound, but nobody is gonna use me for target practice.
I'm through with the army anyway.
I've been looking for the right kind of woman all my life and I think I've found her.
so I quit, take this thing and spend a few weeks somewhere along the blue Mediterranean so you're quitting, eh?
well nobody's stopping you
By the way, you happen to remember what the penalty is for desertion?
There's a 100 ways to dying, brother, and I'm picking my own way.
Go on, get out of here
He's in there
I've never known such a fortune in my life
He's a rich man to buy Morocco.
Don't forget me!
you've met him in my theatre.
Your flowers are wonderful any news of him?
they will not court-martial him.
they're going to transfer him which means of course that he will have to leave town.
do you love him?
anything of less value would be unworthy.
I've got to change
I'd like to take you away from here.
exactly what do you offer now?
the conventional thing
My offer is highly respectable:
marriage
You're a strange man
Do you find it so strange that I shall be fond of you?
must I answer you now?
I'd sleep better tonight if you did.
I don't think I care to take advantage of your tempting offer.
- then you're in love?
- No, I don't think I am.
supposing you had never met a certain private in the foreign legion what would your answer have been?
might have been the same.
I'm sorry to intrude, but I'm leaving for the Sahara in the morning and I just came to say good-bye
I think you two want to be alone.
I understand you are leaving on a rather strenuous journey.
- May I wish you good luck?
- à bientot, Mademoiselle - à bientot
Will you be gone long?
When will I see you again?
Something tells me I'm not coming back this time.
don't go.
that's just what I was thinking.
I could desert and board a freighter for Europe tonight
Why don't you?
I would in a minute if you'd go with me.
Will you?
If you can spare one of your hands, I would like to say goodbye, too.
Goodbye, Mademoiselle.
Why didn't you stay last night?
I had a few other calls to make.
Those women?
I would call them the rear-guard.
How can they keep feet with the men?
They catch up with them, and sometimes they don't.
And very often when they do, they find their men dead.
Those women must be mad.
you see, they love their men
I don't see why we have to keep getting down all day?
We only have to get up again.
anyhow, those walking bed sheets can't shoot straight.
If you go on like this, why don't you quit?
anyhow, I thought you were going to desert?
I've turned decent, Sergeant.
decent.
you'd better not go in.
- What's wrong, Lo Tinto?
She's been drinking, like a fish
And don't send her anymore flowers in pots
She threw just one at me an hour ago
- Hello there
- Bonsoir, Mademoiselle.
How do you like me now?
you seem gay tonight.
Have you had good news?
Have you heard from Private Brown?
Not badly written for a soldier
perhaps it was for the best
Give me a drink
Call my chauffeur, Lo Tinto.
You're losing your headlines tonight.
I'm not losing anything.
She's been no use to me for three weeks.
Legionnaire Brown
Legionnaire Brown!
- Legionnaire Brown!
well, I had the right hunch, didn't I?
that's too bad, Brown wait a minute.
give me those 20 Francs you owe me.
you know, that lady-killer was no bad soldier at that
destroy that machine-gun
May I go too, sir?
You're not at all excited.
read on the night of our engagement dinner, while we're all waiting for you?
everybody's here.
I never believed they would come.
They're delighted to witness the unconditional surrender of the most exacting bachelor in the world.
You want to thank me for making you happy.
You want to thank me for giving you those pearls this morning
You want to thank me for this and you want to thank me for that...
Shall we go down now?
- César was killed.
I received the news this morning.
Legionnaire Tom Brown will probably come back tonight.
- Is his company returning?
you don't need to be concerned about him.
dead or alive there's still time to tell me.
do come, they are waiting
notre ami nous a réservé la surprise la plus inattendue
M. La Bessière, notre ami que nous avons tous, le grand peintre que nous admirons et surtout le plus endurci des vieux garçons
a décidé de joindre nos rangs il va connaitre comme nous les difficultés de la vie conjugale
que nous supportons d'ailleurs très allègrement et il a eu le bonheur, la chance, I'excellence
Mohammed
Pick up those pearls and take them my room please
Where is Tom Brown?
Was he killed?
Not so rough, Mademoiselle I'm liable to fall apart
We left him in at Amalfa.
You can't kill that long drink of water.
Is he badly hurt?
well, we didn't' go down there for any entertainment
I gotta get some sleep
Alexander, don't you think it unusually hot this month?
No, I don't think so
You always disagree with me
When I came to Morocco as a boy, it snowing in the summer have you heard that before, M. La Bessière?
I wasn't listening, Colonel.
what did you say?
When I came to Morocco as a boy...
When you came to Morocco as a boy, it rained or something.
That's it
I have to go to him.
They left him in Amalfa.
- Is he badly wounded?
please don't disturb yourselves and sit down
I don't mind your hearing this
why not let me send a telegram and learn the details.
if his condition is serious we can drive down tomorrow.
order the car and pack my bag
you see, I love her
I do anything to make her happy.
Is Legionnaire Brown here?
There is no Legionnaire Brown here.
- well it might be under some other name.
have a look
Hello, Mademoiselle
I'm looking for Legionnaire Tom Brown
You won't find him down here, diese verdammte Schweinehund
He make believe that he'd been wounded, but they find out and put him in another company
Is he still in town?
He is round the corner, at the Christine.
And don't forget to tell him to pay me the 60 Francs that owes me
It wouldn't be any good if I told you.
you love her very much?
Poor boy
What are you doing in this part of the world?
I heard you were wounded.
I never felt better in my life.
- Are you married?
Why didn't you return with your company?
aren't you gonna marry that rich friend of yours?
of course!
I don't change my mind
well then I wish you all the luck in the world, Mademoiselle
Rassemblement Back to the barracks Antreten, Ihr Schweinehunde, raus!
it's gonna be a thirsty march
go on. beat it.
I forgot my knife.
You forgot to say goodbye, too.
Come and see us off. will you?
maybe.
- Goodbye, Mademoiselle
- Goodbye
Goodbye, Sir
People ought to be ashamed of themselves.
Kicking up all that racket at this time of night.
What is it? Is it a fire?
Well, why can't they knock quietly?
Oh, blast it. We never...
It's about 3 doors down.
That's where Diana Baring is staying.
There's a policeman coming over I think.
Well, just coming around the corner.
Well, that's funny. I could've sworn. No, you're right.
Look. There he is.
Coming down the side of the road.
That's Druce knocking.
Looks as though he's tight again. Here.
Where's my shoes?
I better get down.
What, at this time of night?
My wife Edna! ...with Diana Baring.
She's a-- yeah, wait for me. I'm coming.
I gotta go see what's the matter with Druce.
Say, what's the matter, mr. Druce? Anything wrong?
Will you please take this man away?
Come along now, Druce, there's a good fellow.
Druce: No.
Open this door, will you? ! Open this door!
One of you run down to the station and ask the inspector to come along.
Is this woman a lodger of yours?
No, but miss Baring is. And she had mrs.
Druce to supper with her tonight.
As a matter of fact, it was about-- well, you see, mr. constable, both these ladies are, I mean were that's playing at the theatre royale this week.
And as I was leaving the theatre, you see I'm the stage manager, and mr.
Druce here, he's the general manager.
Well, you see, when I left the theatre tonight, I was invited to join them.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. One at a time, please.
They killed you, Edna. They killed you.
Who, darling? Did she do it?
You always hated Edna.
Thought yourself too good for us...
With your high and mighty ladylike ways.
Now, pull yourself together.
Leave me alone.
Is there any brandy in the house?
You'll find some brandy in the flask on the table.
I was just giving some to Edna when...
I can't think.
I can't remember.
Well, there's none there. It's empty.
I'll run back and fetch some.
Perhaps you'd like a cup of tea, dear. It'll warm you up.
I'll go and make it.
I'll give you a hand, dear.
Shall I light this gas, dear?
Please, dear.
Light the stove, will you, dear?
Druce really is dead, you know, uh...
You know, Diana never did get on well with poor Edna Druce, and I know for a fact that they hadn't been on speaking terms for the last 7 weeks.
Miss Diana said nothing to me about it.
Well, it's a fact. You can take it from me.
I don't believe she could have done it, though there's no denying she is headstrong.
I should say so. Why, she gave in her notice the other day over Edna.
Who, miss Diana?
Yes, but, uh...
Druce didn't want to lose her, so Edna would've been glad enough to see her go.
Then suddenly... Suddenly, last night, she changed, asked if they could make it up.
Diana was puzzled but asked her home to supper.
Now, I can't help feeling now that she had some reason for getting Diana here alone.
Of course, perhaps it's been... Hot stuff like she is, she thought one of her men was getting too keen on Diana Baring and wanted her out of the way.
What kind of tea did you use, dear?
Oh, my dear, I've tried so many kinds, I don't really remember which this is.
I'll get the door, right?
Open the door, yes, if you don't mind.
I say, I've just made tea.
That's all right, ma.
We'll get some down at the station.
Third act beginners, please.
Your call, miss Baring.
That's miss Baring's understudy. There you are, see? Going on now.
Oh, Tom.
Tom. The inspector would like to have a word with you. This is mr.
Tom Druid, inspector.
It's about the murder, mr. Drake. Now, there are one or two points
I suppose you didn't happen to see mrs. Druce and miss Baring leave the theatre together last night.
Yes, I did.
I remarked to Fane, our leading man, about it.
He saw them, as well, you know. Why?
Is it very unusual?
I should say so.
It's an absolute miracle.
As I was saying to my wife, I said, "Annie, we met--"
hold on, old boy.
My cue.
Say, which of the 2 women is this?
You're unlucky this time, inspector.
This is Handell Fane, 100% he-woman. mr.
Fane's our leading man.
I assure you, inspector, I'm not the other woman in the case.
I know that, mr.
Fane, but I understand you saw the 2 women together last night.
Yes, just before I left the theatre, then I went straight to my rooms.
Yes.
Well, Ion Stewart came with me.
He came and he wanted to borrow some cigarettes. He'd lost his case or something, and then I went straight to bed.
Say, excuse me, I'm on.
Reginald, darling, has that cat gone yet?
Ooh, it's you, cousin Yettie. Don't you dare to try to run away from me.
Come here when I speak to you.
No, no, you don't.
That's the bathroom.
Come here, or are you afraid of a poor, weak woman? He promised to meet, dear.
Say, who's that man? Oh, that's our heavy lead.
Ion Stewart.
Very sound actor.
How did he get on with the prisoner?
Say, how did he get on with the prisoner miss Baring?
So-so, you know?
Was he popular with the ladies?
He's a bit too popular if you ask me.
Please, if you could call her a lady. Shh.
Now, Doucie, remember, she's only just dead.
Oh, all right, all right.
I've never heard yet that telling the truth was a disgrace.
Only been one year about Edna and Stewart anyhow.
And the way I take it, mr. Stewart and mrs. Druce...
My line.
Don't bother to show me through.
This is not the first time, Reginald.
Well, perhaps I ought not to say Edna and Stewart like that.
But, Ted, you know what Edna was like, anyone she liked had to be wrote in.
Excuse me a minute, inspector. Shan't be long.
There's a quick change.
What have they done with her?
Why, she's down at the station, I expect.
Did she say anything, do you know?
Is there anything I can do?
Markham, you don't really think she's done it, do you?
Why have they arrested her?
Saw it with me own eyes.
She was with the poker in her hand just by her side anyway.
Why, what's the matter with you?
Blood always makes me feel sick, even the mention of it.
Well, that's all right. Here's your helmet.
Hurry up, Markham.
Diana Baring is indicted and stands charge with the willful murder of Edna Druce.
For this indictment, she has pleaded not guilty.
It is your duty to inquire whether she is guilty or not.
I need not remind you that in the eyes of the law, men and women are equal.
The crime of murder in England, at least, is judged dispassionately.
Neither beauty nor youth nor provocation can mitigate...
She gave me the strangest look.
Half-surprised... And half-angry.
And she said: "How dare you!"
And I don't remember anymore.
I just don't remember.
Must have happened when I was not conscious of myself.
Our defense is a complete denial of all responsibility.
You've been able to observe the behavior of the prisoner in the dock... And in the witness box.
My learned friend has referred to her behavior as hardened.
Gentlemen and ladies of the jury, is there anything so hardy as the behavior of sheer innocence?
If you're convinced that the story of the defense represents the facts it is your duty to discharge the accused.
I shall like to remind you that truth is often stranger than fiction.
Go and consider the facts for yourselves.
Well, uh, ladies and gentlemen, we can't talk standing.
Would you ladies like to sit together?
Why, I say, may we smoke?
I don't see why not.
That is, if the ladies haven't any objection.
Now, I think the best thing to do... if you agree, is to allow me to go over the broad facts of the case.
Because after all, I think it's pretty clear and I really don't think it'll be necessary for us to examine all the evidence again in detail.
Now, in the first place, the prosecution.
They say that the girl and the dead woman were on bad terms.
They make it up.
Edna Druce comes to supper, they both have a drop too much and begin quarreling about some man.
For instance, you heard how the landlady said that she heard raised voices.
And the girl admits as much but won't give the name of the man.
Now that in itself is fishy.
The girl gets hold of the poker, loses her temper, and there's the end of Edna Druce.
The prosecution argues that it has proofs.
Practically caught red-handed.
Girl's dress all over blood, the poker at her feet, brandy flask empty, and the girl half-silly.
And in addition to that, no other person was known to have entered the house.
I think that's pretty clear.
I think you ought to mention that the girl comes of a good family.
Yes, but it's those so-called well-bred people who are able to remain so brazen in the face of a thing like this.
Well, look at the way she behaved in the box.
Half a minute, ladies.
Let's get on.
Now, take the defense. They don't deny she did it but argue that their case is that the thing happened when... She was in a fit or something.
In other words, disassociation, which in this particular form is called a fugue.
So that a person displaying the strangest behavior for a considerable period of time would be quite unaware of this when he or she regained normality.
Well, I think the best thing for us all to do is to write down our opinions and then we can see how we stand.
Whichever in the minority... Can then give their individual reasons and the thing can be worked out that way.
That makes 7 guilty... And 3 not guilty.
There are 2 not in.
I take it you haven't come to any decision at all.
I think the whole business is hateful.
There's too much responsibility put on our shoulders.
Either we've got to let her go free-- that's not fair to the rest of the world if she's guilty-- or we got to hang her
But if we recommend her to mercy.
Mercy? Is that what you call it?
20 years cut out of life.
The best years and to spend them in hell.
Have you ever been inside a prison? It takes a civilized community to think out a punishment like that.
I think you exaggerate.
It's no use confusing the issue like this.
People who do wrong have got to be punished somehow.
You can't run the world on sentiment.
No, but that's what we've tried to do. Save the unfit.
Get more children and make glorious wars to be rid of.
The whole world's a reeking pit of sentiment.
Your verdict, mr.
Guilty, I suppose.
You, mr. Matthews?
Is there anything special troubling you so that you can't make a decision?
What is it prevents you from making a decision?
Well, nothing really.
Uh, well, uh... Have you made up your mind at all what it's going to be?
You heard the case for the prosecution. That's pretty clear, isn't it?
And you know what the defense is, don't you?
Don't quite understand what the lady meant when she said no. When, uh... When she spoke.
My dear man, mrs. Ward was only trying to tell you that the defense was that murder was committed in a fit of daytime sleep walking.
The murder took place at nighttime.
Well, will you please write down whether you think the prisoner guilty or not?
Now that leaves only 3 for not guilty.
I'll give you my reasons for not guilty.
The evidence for the defense by the doctor is to my mind conclusive.
And it is on these grounds, that I feel that Diana Baring must have been the victim of circumstance.
I have no doubt that mrs. Ward is right.
That being the case, it is quite liable to recur, possibly with the same results.
Well, that's a point I hadn't considered.
Well, it's really important.
Because with this poor gal, you have to consider not only this one tragedy but others that may follow it. There may be other crimes lying ...
You mean, there's a sort of dual personality in her.
One of these persons is violent and cruel and the other, just an ordinary woman.
If we set this bad personality free, we must be prepared to show her the responsibility.
If we let her go and anything should happen...
The blood would be on our hands.
Do you wish to alter your verdict, mrs.
After all you've heard, does your opinion still remain the same?
Well, you know, I find it very difficult to believe that a girl of that sort should do such a thing.
After all, she looks perfectly riveting, you know.
Well, you know what I mean? A sort of girl one would like for a daughter.
I presume, sir, that an ugly woman would stand very little chance at your hand.
The thing you've got to decide, mr. Daniels, has nothing to do with the qualities of the young lady as they appeal to you.
Yes, of course. I know that.
But, that's all, well, you know what I mean. It's...
It's pretty awful and all that sort of thing.
Besides the thing you're thinking of, what's your verdict?
Well, now we're practically complete.
There's just sir John.
Well, don't dismiss me as easily at that, mr. foreman. Yes?
We mustn't be long.
Time is money, you know?
Time in this case, may I remind you, is life.
If I'm delaying you all, I apologize.
I admit that I am not... A man of business.
I'm a poor actor.
Oh, come now, dear sir John.
I repeat... The poorest of poor players.
And my time on the stage will be shortened had I not for years trained myself to... How shall I put it...
To apply the technique of life... to the problems of my art.
But today, ladies and gentlemen, that process is reversed.
I find myself applying the technique of my art to a problem of real life.
And my art is not satisfied.
In the first place, I am fairly convinced that Diana Baring was telling the thruth when she said she remembered nothing.
In fact, I have been impressed by her behavior all through the trial.
Oh, I say, sir John.
Oh, please don't think I'm taking the same line as our friend mr. Daniels here.
He made a very gallant attempt, but I assure you my reasoning goes a little deeper.
I am convinced further that she was again telling the truth when she said she had drunk no brandy.
Buy you've forgotten the evidence of the police sergeant.
He said she smelled of drink and appeared dazed on arrest.
How do you know that was not the wine she had at dinner?
What about the evidence of Markham, the stage manager?
He found the empty brandy flask right on the spot. Yes, but--
What about the evidence of the actor, Stewart?
He said the women had been enemies for some time.
Ah, he was the one who said prisoner was rough to mrs.
All pointing to her violent nature, sir John.
Yes, but that was not altogether borne out by Fane.
You know, the, um... Well, the female impersonator man.
But his evidence was of little use. He was so obviously in love with the prisoner.
In any case, everything was perfectly clear when the body was discovered.
Why, the woman was actually caught in the room red-handed.
And found with a poker by her side.
And her dress all over blood.
And quarrelling over a man.
Any answer to that, sir John?
Think of her personality. She's not the kind of girl to get drunk.
Brandy in the flask, was there?
She doesn't deny it.
Not at the moment.
Was there anyone entered the house that night?
Landlady says not.
Girl says not.
They were alone.
Any answer to that, sir John?
Not at the moment.
But have we taken it too much for granted that no one else could've done the murder?
Says they quarelled.
Admits it.
She does not admit it.
She says she doesn't remember.
Is that a guilty woman's answer?
And her dress all over blood.
Make an exhibition of yourself.
Waste of time, waste of money.
Quarelling.
Hands all over blood.
Any answer? Any answer? Any answer to that, sir John?
Well, now that we've all agreed on our verdict, I can inform the judge that we're ready.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?
And do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?
Diana Baring, have you anything to say? My sentence of death should now be passed upon you according to law.
It's absurd, I tell you.
It's absolutely absurd.
Praise silence, all of you, on the pain of imprisonment while sentence of death is passed upon the prisoner at the bar.
Adjourned until tomorrow.
The Baring murder trial came to a conclusion today with a verdict of guilty, and sentence of death was passed on Diana Baring.
And that is all the news.
But here is an S.O.S., which has just been brought into the studio.
We've been asked by the commissioner of police to broadcast the following--
The brandy cocktail you ordered, sir.
Bennett, will you? And ask him to bring me the details of the receipts for the last 3 nights.
Also,...booking...
With New Scotland Yard to telephone Victoria 7000 or with any police station.
This is the national program.
Our concert tonight is an orchestral one, given by the radio symphony orchestra.
They start by playing the overture to Tristan und Isolde by Wagner.
Funny that S.O.S. Coming on top of that other.
Save her soul.
Save her.
If I'd stood up longer, I might have worn them down.
Why couldn't they see the girl as I did...
The rest of the fellows on the jury.
But anyone standing in the dark on a charge like that...
Probably looks different from the same person somewhere else.
Ah, amusing the way she stood up to everybody.
There's no doubt that did her a lot of harm.
Yet, it was that manner of hers that...
Very attractive I thought.
And I wonder what her feelings are now.
Who drank that brandy? !
Why didn't I force that point home to them?
Easy to figure these things out afterwards.
The girl said she didn't drink it.
Yet she admits she might have killed Edna Druce.
That's queer.
Why admit a big thing like that and yet be sure she didn't do a small thing such as drink a drop of brandy?
All that came to light to me today.
I'm sure I was right when I raised that. Quite frankly, more certain now.
How do we know that someone else didn't drink the brandy?
Perhaps there was someone else, that's the whole thing.
Mr. Bennett has come up to see you, sir John.
Been reading about it all.
Plenty of publicity.
Been awful for you, though. You having met days before.
Well, she wanted to become a star, a year ago that was.
I suppose you can say in a sense that she has.
A star in a murder--
Bennett, please.
Get hold of my understudy. Tell him he has to go on again tonight.
Pray god that I give him a better role.
Get on the telephone straight away to my lawyer, mr.
Vice senior.
Oh, I can give it to you. Temple bar. 5-9-9-3.
In particular, the, um... funny little man, the stage manager.
I'll see him at the office in the morning.
But I thought the trial was over, sir John.
No, my dear, Bennett, the trial is not over, by a hell of a long way. Well...
Is it conscience, sir John? Conscience.
A lying man's conscience.
Oh, they're-- they're engaged, sir. Ok.
I'll try later. Don't wait.
Diana Baring...
Why did I send her away?
Told her it'd be good for her to gain experience ...
Good for her.
And now she's come back.
I think, uh... Boiling it all down, dear, I think perhaps we better, uh...
Either that one or one of the other 2. It's all the same to me.
That would be sir John himself. I don't think.
Seems she won't let us stay on here any longer.
That means Lucy will have to go back to her aunt's-- oh, I mean, uh--
Sophie will have to go back to her aunt Lucy.
I don't want to go back to aunt Lucy. I want to go on tour with you.
I can't let you go back to sir John's.
I really thought you were kidding me, I really did.
It's from sir John himself.
If we could be in his office at 12:00.
Do you think we could get there in time today?
If we try.
This just needs a little benzine.
Petrol will get the shine out of this suit. I'll say!
There's a job for you!
I think it must be an ankle.
What have you done with me nail polish?
Hope this smell of petrol goes off.
Oh, well, you can blame it onto the car.
I think we shall just about do it.
Actually, my dear, it won't be. Oh, that's all right, missus.
I promise you your bill shall be paid the first.
I'm not referring to bills.
It's Druce I'm after. Two seats...
How do you do, mr. Markham?
You know, it seems to me, mr. Markham, that we as artists have a double function.
We use life to create art and we use art to, how shall I put it... to criticize life.
Oh, certain, mr.
John.
Now, mr. Markham, between artists...
Do we always fulfill our double function?
Are we not so much occupied in using life to create art that we forget our other function?
I foresee your objection.
You're going to say, what opportunities does the round of daily life offer?
I wonder if... If you ever saw a problem play I once did. Pistols for two.
What the critics describe as a high-brow shocker.
When a high-brow shocker occurs in real life, does the public call in the actor? No.
Uh... mr. Markham, I read your thoughts.
You know, you're saying to yourself, this man is, um, talking to his hat. Oh, no.
Oh, of course you are.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be the practical man I take you for.
You're also wondering to yourself, why on earth I've brought you here.
That brings me at last... To my object.
Yesterday and the day before, I was on the jury at the Baring trial. You impressed me both as an artist and as a man.
By the way you gave your evidence.
Now, I want from you, if I'm not being too indiscrete-- the inner history of that case.
Oh, what is it that, uh...
See, now, of course, um...
Bennett talked over with you the question of that engagement?
You see, we'd rather, uh... Rather hoped that you'd be free to take on the stage management when I send off this tour at christmas of The Green Eye.
I also thought of working out some arrangement on a yearly bases but we could easily talk that over later
Thank you very much indeed, sir John.
Well, I am free at the moment.
And I've had a lot of experience that I'm sure will come in very handy.
Then that's settled, huh?
Markham?
Well, it's my wife, sir John.
mrs. Markham acts.
Acts, sir John?
Heh. Well, uh... Perhaps it's not for me to say, but...
if you understand what I'm getting at, My Doucie, my wife--well, professionally, she's been my right hand.
And there's no one she can't play 24 hours' notice. From a Gladys Cooper to a Molly Lloyd part.
I was going to say she has her off days, of course. Well, who hasn't?
I mean, only last summer I had to speak to her seriously about it.
She had a quick change-over from a barmaid to a Salvation Army lass.
And it told on her, there's no doubt about it, after about a week, I said to her straight out:
"Now look here, my dear, this can't go on if you can't pull yourself together, we shall have to go into Shakespeare."
Well, she didn't say much.
But she thought it over. And for the rest of that tour I'll give you my word, sir John, she was tallulah.
She's downstairs waiting in the-- Oh.
Let's send for her to come up.
Markham is somewhere downstairs.
Would you have her sent up, please?
About this trial...
I confess to feeling very uneasy about it.
You see, I played a part in the thing, the part of a juryman.
And it was not until the curtain was rung down on the death sentence, that I said to myself...
This is not a play, this is life.
Life can be less kind than your dramatists, mr.
Life permits a beautiful and unfortunate girl to go to the gallows.
Unless-- art for once can bring its technique to bear.
Good lord, do you mean to say she is innocent, my dear Markham, yes.
It was assumed she was guilty because she couldn't deny it.
Yes, but I saw the--
Diana Baring sitting beside the dead body.
She was dazed you say.
What was the cause?
Drink?
She hardly ever touched anything.
And who did? Think it over, mr. Markham.
Then there was the pain in her head.
Was she examined by a doctor?
Might he not have found traces of a blow if he'd examined her?
He assumed like everyone else that she was guilty because she didn't deny it.
And there was no private investigation, no inquiry, think it over, mr.
I feel the most terrible responsibility.
I was one of the 12 people who decided the fate of this poor girl.
I found myself caught up with the machine that-- that makes these things...
Markham, so good of you to come with your husband this morning.
Oh, I was quite glad, glad as a breath of fresh air.
What a charming place you have up here, sir John.
And Piccadilly, with all the shops so near.
You'll stay to lunch, of course.
I find it difficult sometimes to wait to a reasonable hour for my luncheon.
I feel the same way myself.
That I can do without my little tidbits in the morning...
Oh, Javier, a cocktail at once, please, and serve lunch.
He's engaged us to see him. Joint.
So I thought he could, um... Oh, we can settle all that later, can't we?
In the meantime, success to our researches.
Your husband and I have been discussing the Baring case.
And we feel that if the murder were approached from another angle, it--oh, sorry. We shall be able to arrive at a different result.
And get Diana off you mean?
But she can't get away from that poker.
If you don't share our convictions that miss Baring is not guilty--
well, I mean to say Diana Baring was such a nice girl.
I never thought for one moment she could've done a thing like that.
Didn't I always say, Ted, never could've thought it for one moment?
Oh, sir John, have you found anything out?
Are you going to take it up yourself? Oh, we would be so glad to help, wouldn't we, Ted?
I really don't know where to begin this thing, do you, Markham?
I wish I knew where to begin.
Yes, can I help you there?
Sir John didn't know where to begin, Ted.
Let's hear it, mrs. Markham.
See, I'm completely in the dark.
If your husband could show the way,
What is it, Markham?
Well, sir John... I should say the best place would be the back of the town where the murder was committed.
Do you think you could spare me a day or two of your time?
Why, yes, of course we could, sir.
See, if I might suggest that we could go over the ground and you could show me one or two places connected with the murder.
But, you mean, it might have been someone else altogether, who killed Edna Druce?
It might've been somebody from outside.
How do you make that out?
Well, I don't know. Miss Mitcham didn't do it.
And miss Diana didn't. So it must've been somebody from outside.
If it was, they'd have to get in. And they'd have to get out again.
Heh. That's clever.
Well, Ted, for start, there's that chap we thought was the policeman coming around the corner.
Oh, that was nothing. I shall like to hear something about this policeman.
Well, you see, sir John, it was like this...
Only after the murder, when the knocking woke us up,
I was over by the window and I popped my head out of the window to see who it was making all that noise.
And I saw the policeman coming around the corner.
So I said to Ted, I said, hey, it's the police.
And then I took my eyes off him to tell Ted here...
And when I looked again, there was no one in sight.
And then Ted said, yes, you're right.
And when I looked again, it was a different policeman altogether.
What had become of the first one?
He must have turned the corner and come back.
Is that the corner down there?
Yes, that's it, sir.
You're sure it wasn't the same man?
We only took our eyes off of him about 2 seconds.
Is there anymore here do you think, sir?
I shouldn't think so.
My god, that's Druce. He must be crazy.
Yeah, we better get down.
Please, promise to stop it.
Yes, that's all right. Now come along, Druce. My wife's...
But you're much better at home.
Come on now.
Oh, this is terrible for me this business is.
I shall have to move. I'm sure I shall.
Mitcham, we'd like to show this gentleman around.
May I? Oh.
Of course. Yes. Certainly.
Well, sir John, that's where they found the body.
Right in front of the hearth there.
Miss Baring was sitting just about there.
Oh, by the way, did you ever get your poker back, miss-- oh, I can't bear to talk about it, especially with poor miss Baring being where she is.
Why, you might as well convict Cleopatra.
You think anybody could've got in from the back of the house?
You see just beyond the backyard there's an alleyway, and just beyond there there's the theatre.
And look, sir, the dressing rooms are at the back.
Yes, it would take quite an athlete to get in that way.
I don't see how anyone could get in here with this aspidistra filling up the window.
Anyway, without upsetting it, and look at the size of it.
It's a fine plant.
Unless, of course, it was somebody who knew the room.
But miss Baring did not have any visitors, only mrs. Markham every now and again, and mr.
Fane and mr.
Stewart to tea and mister-- what's his name-- the little man with the squeaky voice.
Oh, Tom Druid. Yes.
Squeaky voice, that reminds me.
In your evidence, miss Mitcham, you said you had heard angry women's voices. Yes, sir, I did.
Oh, yes, sir.
You can't mistake a woman's voice.
You know, I had known a contralto-- oh, yes, but this was high, quite high.
Miss Mitcham. Miss Mitcham. Oh, my god, miss Mitcham.
The kitchen chimney's on fire, miss Mitcham!
That's alice.
One moment, miss Mitcham. Excuse me, sir.
I can't stop just now.
That Alice of mine has set the kitchen chimney on fire.
Didn't you hear her calling?
No, no, no. That was me.
Or did I... You know, Markham, I never know.
I played a trick on you, miss Mitcham.
Now, the high voice you heard that night may not have been a woman's.
You've just admitted it.
I have not admitted anything.
And I don't hold to playing such tricks.
And I'd like to ask you, sir, what you mean by it.
And you, too, mr. Markham. Standing there, grinning.
You realize that your evidence as it stands may hang miss Baring?
Now, I'm not blaming you. Not blaming you, miss Mitcham.
But you swore that you heard women's voices calling.
And I have to prove to them that it might have been a man's voice, especially a high-pitched man's voice-- just like mr.
Druid's. Ohh!
I'd do anything for miss Baring. Oh, can't something be done now? Yes, yes.
Now you're going to help us further.
First of all, could you show us some more of the house?
Miss Baring's bedroom, for example?
There's a few of her things over there on the windowsill.
I didn't like to send them to where she is now.
Oh, I think she'd like them.
Well, let me have them and I'll send them on.
Why, it's one of you, sir.
Lot more places to go to, sir John.
Lot more places, sir John.
And then we'll go round to Stewart's lodgings and then we might go along to the police station, have a chat with the inspector.
He knows me. And then, um...
Well, then we can go across the Red Lion, have a sandwich while we're talking to Joe the proprietor.
And then--ooh, and then there's Stevens, if the policeman's still on his beat.
Yes, I think that's about all we can do.
Oh, yes, we'll find out something if it takes us all night.
I thought perhaps, um... A little dinner... Oh.
Oh, that's all right, sir John. Don't you worry about Doucie and me.
We've had to go without before, didn't we, dear?
Well, shall we begin, sir John?
I've come to see if any of my people left anything behind.
No, nothing, except that there broken basin in number 4 dressing room.
Of your chaps after they left.
They never paid for it neither.
Uh, Fane's and Stewart's, I believe, sir.
No, none of our people broke that, mate.
Oh, there is something for you.
This cigarette case left behind in number 4. You'll know who it belong to.
Oh, righto. When I find out who it is,
Can we see that dressing room?
Uh, I'd like to see that broken basin.
I'll take you long.
Where does that window look out to?
The private houses round the corner.
I wish I knew who broke that basin.
Lot more places to go to, sir John.
Did you find anything? No, nothing much.
Well, here we are, sir John. And, uh, I hope you sleep well.
She's left something cold out for you.
I'll be along first thing in the morning.
I'm awfully sorry but... Get to bed myself.
I must say, this street gives me the creeps.
Well, good night, sir John.
Come along, dear.
I say, Markham.
You don't think that I'd better eat at the Red Lion after all, do you?
Well, that's, uh... Just as you like, of course, sir John, but, uh...
I thought you wanted to sleep
I mean, that's why I made the arrangements.
Considering we haven't found out very much today, I think that...
You, too, children.
Take it. Ohh.
We mustn't play on the bed. Sir, shall I pull over the table?
Leave them things be!
Just put the plate on somewhere.
I'll see to it. I'll dress first.
Oh, don't say that, sir.
I know what you gents like.
"A nice cup of tea and a kipper before I get up. And I'm a new man."
That's what my last lodger used to say.
Stop playing on that bed!
Damn children.
They follow me about.
Ma this and ma that.
On my word, I don't have a moment's peace morning or night.
What do you two be doing?
That's quite all right, really. He's got my bootsy!
Well, I never did. Wait till i get you downstairs.
And don't you bring it up here again.
If you could put this plate on the table and bring up some hot water at once, just as you like, sir, but...
Now, go downstairs and get the water on.
Now, why can't you leave him be?
I've told them not to mess with the lodger's luggage.
I'll have your father take you to the police station if you can't stop touching.
Some lodgers don't like it.
Princeton, I had a couple a little while back and one of them give them a good clip for doing that.
You know the Baring case? Well, they was in it.
It was my husband what found the body.
He was part of the Baring case.
Well, I never. Ha ha!
She's taken a fancy to you.
There ain't many she takes to.
You're not coming around now, I suppose.
You were saying... About hopping on the luggage...
Oh, yes. Well,
Arthur was messing about with one of them's luggage when he come across what he thought was his father's helmet and uniform.
Afterwards, I went up.
And I said I don't like the idea of having this in my home.
Just because he had a uniform in the bag it was his father's outfit.
I felt a bit of a fool when I finished because he simply turned around and he said I didn't know what I was talking about.
Well, I said if it wasn't you, it must have been the other one who was here-- mr.
Stewart. I spoke to mr. Stewart afterwards but in the excitement of the murder
Come in, my dear Markham.
I thought I'd drop by, miss.
I'll send the water up, sir.
Don't encourage her too much, sir.
Just come on, come on.
Now go in the street and play. Don't you get run over. Go on.
Doucie and me found out something, sir John.
You know that cigarette case you found in the theatre?
Well, last night I went to smoke in bed just before I went off, you see? So I took out that case.
Doucie saw it wasn't mine.
Said, I've seen it before somewhere.
I said, whose is it? She said Stewart's. She noticed what I thought was a beer stain on it...
She says, wait a minute. Well, look, see for yourself, sir John.
Look.
I believe you're right.
Who wore a policeman's uniform in the past who lived here?
Fane and Stewart, sir.
Stewart had a quick change-over but Fane had a special uniform made to fit him so we had 2 uniforms in the company, sir John.
You're an important factor in this case, Markham.
In fact, most important at the moment.
Well, if it helps, sir John.
No, the most important factor seems to be a policeman whom you did not see on the night of the murder.
You remember your wife saw a policeman you went to the window and you couldn't see one.
That policeman was 2 different people.
And for all we know... The first one was not a member of the county constabulary.
You mean, the first one was a fake, sir?
A chap in policeman's clothes?
Our next job is to find out the name of the man was he a member of the company?
Did he wear a policeman's uniform?
If she still refuses to give the name... Perhaps the cigarette case will help her to remember.
They were calling about on the night of the murder?
This end, please.
It's very good of you to have come.
But I can't help saying... I'm extremely surprised.
I've taken a very great interest in your case.
Don't let's talk about it.
How's your play going?
Pretty fair.
Of course you know I was away from it some time because I was on the jury of your trial.
My countryhouse is in that district.
As you know, I can't discuss with you what happened on the jury...
Is Muriel Heatherly still playing the lead with you?
I do think she's such a good actress.
You remember our meeting?
You do remember.
If I hadn't sent you away on tour to get experience... You wouldn't be in this position now.
That's, in a way, why I feel... Sort of... Responsibility.
That's why I've come.
There must be some grounds for an appeal.
I knew someone would try and get me off and think they were doing me a kindness.
Imprisonment for life.
Why, a week of it's nearly driven me crazy.
If they want to do the other thing... They can.
I thought it and got over it.
It'll be no worse than the dentist.
And if I have done this thing, as they say I have, I'm better out of the way.
As for the other thing, if you're a friend to me, you couldn't do it.
Lock yourself up in your own room... For one day.
Only for one day and see.
Tell me what I want to know, I'll have you out of here altogether.
What is that? I can tell you.
Tell me the name of the man discussed by you and Edna Druce.
I've said so many times before.
He has no connection with the case.
Besides, I didn't quarrel.
Edna Druce tried to say poisonous things about him.
And I just put my fingers in my ears and kept them there.
So that you actually couldn't hear a sound.
You couldn't have heard of any other person that had come into the room.
I suppose I couldn't.
Why wouldn't you listen to her?
Because... I knew what Edna was trying to tell me.
What was she trying to tell you?
It involved... Somebody else.
Plenty of other people have been involved in this case.
Markham, Stewart, Druce... Fane.
Why shouldn't this one man's name be known?
There was something... Something he daren't have known.
But which you knew.
You realize what you're admitting by your silence?
Because you know you're in love with him.
Oh, but that's impossible. Impossible?
Why should it be impossible?
I see no reason why it should be impossible.
Why, the man's a half-caste.
What's that? What did you say?
A half-caste? Black blood!
Why haven't you said so much?
Tell me the rest. What was his name?
I won't tell you that.
Will this help you to remember the name of the man you were quarelling about?
Stewart's cigarette case?
That's not one of Stewart's things.
You mustn't give the prisoner anything here, sir.
And the time for the interview has nearly ended, sir.
Oh, sir John.
For these last few moments, let's talk about something else.
There was a photograph of me in your room.
How did you know? I went there to make inquiries.
How did you come to get it?
I've always been keen on the stage ever since I was a little girl.
One has one's heroes.
That's why I came to you for a job.
And I sent you away.
Oh, let's talk some more quickly.
Miss Mitcham sent me some of my things. Your photograph with them.
I've got it in my cell now. They let us keep some-- come.
Time's up please.
I'm going to find Fane.
What's become of Handell Fane?
Any news of Fane yet, Markham?
Not yet, sir John.
I'm trying some more of the agents though.
Haven't you found Fane yet, Ted? I can't bear the suspense.
We shall be up all night, you know.
Hello? Hello?
Is that lambersee agents?
You found Fane yet?
He's wanted for an important job, you know.
Gone back to his old job?
Trapeeze artist?
Got him at last.
Yes, that's him all right.
Dressed up as a woman, eh?
Always was good at that.
An extremely clever way of hiding.
I've an idea.
You know your Hamlet?
Then let me suggest for your consideration the series of events embodied in act 3, scene 2.
That's the play scene, isn't it, sir?
Yes. The play scene.
Do you remember the title... The mousetrap? Yes.
Well, when he comes to my theatre to read a part I shall offer him, there'll be 3 of us.
2 cats to one mouse.
Yes, but what about the cheese, sir?
The cheese, yes. The cheese will be a fat part, Markham.
A villain's part in the blood and thunder in a play that I'm going to write especially for him.
A play based on a recent well-known murder case.
I imagine he will play his part, as I hope we shall convince him... To the life.
Who is that you have with you?
Of course, I remember.
This is the gentleman you suggested.
Yes, sir John. mr. Handell Fane.
No, Bennett, don't go.
You see, I always conduct these interviews so badly, I'm just as likely as not to leave out the really important points.
Now, I suppose I better begin by an explanation. I dare say mr.
Bennett has told you the author of the play?
No, sir John.
I understand you wish that to be kept a secret for the time being.
Well, I wrote the play.
That was a simple matter, but it's proving astonishingly difficult to find the right person for one particular part.
Might I ask you to stand up for one moment?
He looks it quite perfectly.
Exactly what I've been thinking, sir John.
Would you mind reading one or 2 lines? You know, just to give me some idea?
Tell--what's his name-- Baldwin to bring me a clean copy of act 3.
Might I ask you... What kind of play is this exactly?
Well, you may question my taste, but as an artist, you'll understand my temptation.
My subject, mr. Fane, is the inner history of the Baring case.
Really? Your... Your indifference astonishes me.
Aren't I right in thinking that you were a member of the Druce company at the time?
Then you knew both women concerned.
Yes, I knew them both quite well.
Oh, by the way, mr. Fane, I understand you're appearing at present at the circus.
Would that interfere?
No, I don't suppose so, no.
Let me give you... Some idea of the scene.
Here is a table in front of a fireplace, more or less a ....
On the table there's the remains of a meal. And, of course, the brandy flask.
Fane, of course, you know all the details of the case. I can't help wondering, why nothing spectacular developed in connection with the brandy.
Thinking as a dramatist, I can't help feeling that the brandy was not exploited with sufficient imagination.
Then, of course, the law has no sense of drama, has it?
I thought it best to begin from a point just before the actual murder.
There's a short scene between the 2 women... Which turns into a quarrel.
In the middle of it, you make your entrance, on the words--I got this from the evidence--
"friends?
I can tell you things about your friends that you don't know."
Just carry on from that point, would you?
Now, how on earth did you know the entrance was from the window?
That's highly clever.
And look, mr. Fane, you've forgotten your script.
Now, where are we? "Friends?
I can tell you things..."
Wouldn't it be better if I were to pick up the poker before I made the entrance to the room?
I'll put that in.
May I have the poker?
No, I'm terribly sorry.
We only have electric fires here.
Would this pencil do?
We must get on without the poker.
You can use your imagination, eh?
Now then...
Through the window, into the room.
You creep through the double doors.
The 2 women are facing each other. You come slowly around, taking care not to be heard and gradually you approach the one whose back is to you.
Now, you raise the poker that is in your hand as the other woman says...
Don't you know that he's a half--"
what a pity, sir John.
The scene isn't finished.
I was getting quite worked up to it.
I thought perhaps... You might be able to collaborate with us.
I'm so sorry, sir John.
I'm afraid I understand so little about playwriting.
Perhaps later on... When the script is finished... You'll allow me to give you another reading.
Find out what time Fane comes on tonight.
I shan't be...
How do you do, sir John?
Who'd have thought of seeing you here?
Well, you see, I'm, uh... I'm working for sir John now.
Markham is helping me with my new play.
I suppose you find brandy steadying for the nerves?
Mine's very nerving work, you see, sir John?
Hurry up. You're next.
I presume you've come to talk to me about... That part again, sir John.
You know perfectly well what I've come here for.
Hurry up, Fane.
There'll be a wait if you're not careful.
How are you, sir John?
I've really come to see mr.
Sir John, if you wouldn't mind coming down to see me after my act,
I shall only be too pleased to talk over that little matter we were discussing.
For god's sakes, play something!
Fane says he has decided to colloborate in my play after all.
He says... "The 2 women are standing "facing each other in dead silence.
"They are so lost in the tension of the moment "that they do not hear the murderer creep through "the double doors into the room.
"The murdered woman is at that instant going to speak.
"The murderer springs forward. "He hurls the first woman aside.
"She is stunned by the fall, "but he doesn't notice it.
"Infuriated, "he strikes out at the other woman "with the poker.
"She falls by the fireplace,
"she's dead.
"He nearly faints at the sight of the blood.
"He drinks the brandy,
"then he sees the other woman beginning to stir.
"He must get away...
"Through the back window. A leap or two. Finally, a climb into the theatre dressing room."
That accounts for the broken basin.
"But how to get home undetected from the theatre.
An idea. The policeman's uniform he wore on the stage."
There's your policeman, Markham.
"He walks home a murderer.
"A murderer on an impulse. "The silence of the mouth of a woman "who knew his secret and was going to reveal it
There's a melodrama for you, sir John."
Well, Markham... You have it all.
Poor devil.
And Diana Baring...
She knew all the time...
(in chorus) # Long live the sparkling wine, # of Frascati and Marino. #
# Live forever the sparkling Asti, # # the Champagne and the Bordeaux. #
# Among the eating and drinking, # # with women close beside, # # we'll be entertained on the springs of the sofa. #
# Long live the sparkling wine, # # of Frascati and Marino. #
# Live forever the sparkling Asti, # # the Champagne and the Bordeaux. #
Nero:
Ave, Caesar!
- All:
Ave, ave.
What's so funny? Never seen an emperor?
# Where am I?
Who is this mob, # # watching me?
But where do I find myself?
# Heaven! What do I see? My vision dazzles. #
# Is it an old world or is it a new world!
# They've just dug me up. Oh, oh... #
# Oh, la la la. #
# But I do not know how to explain it well, # # if I came here by myself, or if they sent for me. #
Tomorrow, if you go to stores to purchase this article in the Cathedral, you'll find that it's cheap.
I work in the public square, for the Bomb Norcia company.
I want to spit blood but I can't.
Stand back, boy, let me work!
Not for your needs, because needs, we already have enough, thank God.
Tell me, 4 is too much, 3 is too much, it's still expensive.
A pound per meter! Toh!
Take it away, let them see.
If you don't like it, we have other articles.
Oh, the old days of brave warriors!
Hearts of steel and tempers of glass.
Where is that Muzio, good old Muzio. Muzio!
Muzio Scaevola who fought the Etruscans, so strong, he put his hand in the fire and let it burn!
But is that story true?
- The historians say so.
- Sounds like a tale for the fireplace.
And the rule of Atilius Regulus?
A rule that you nor I have ever observed.
What a time!
That Golden Age of the great Ulysses!
The most fearless warrior who ever lived to fight.
Times sung by Homer and 'Bignose' Ovidius, and later by Virgil, and then Nero, the famous singer.
Mucrone, would you like a drink.
Would you fancy, listening to my latest verse? - All: Now!
The tench fish said to the pike:
'What are you doing, oh pike?
'.
Replied the pike:'I do what I like.'
Moral: or tench, or pike, do what you like.
All: Well! Bravo!
We want him undressed.
Gourmet!
Moral: who falls gets hurt.
You can't spell service without vice.
But this is the imperial triclinium and I do not see Poppea.
There's Poppea?
Do not be jealous: Poppea is no longer popping.
Where's Poppea? What is it?
You wanted me, dear Caesar?
Nero: Greatly! I longed for you.
- All: Hail! - Hail and thunder!
No longer matron but godmother now, huh? Ripe as fruit in Autumn, worthy of being immortalized in marble by Phidias.
Too bad you put on weight!
Melius est abundare deficere quam.
Unlike you, you're bones, skins, nerves, but flesh... nothing!
- Tell me, do you want to take a walk?
- Und spazieren? - Yes.
- Space enough...
- Are you tired?
- Nein?
(in German) My biggest darling, give me a kiss.
You will always be my chick?
And Acte and Calvia?
- They're only substitutes.
- I can't stand them.
Well, let's have some fun by abolishing them.
Take 100 slaves from Acte, and give them to Poppaea.
- Thank you. I withdraw.
- Then I withdraw too.
- Ave.
- Bye, Caesar. Bye, Caesar's, see you tonight.
And I? And how shall I cope without the slaves?
Careful or I'll give you one in the face to send you to that post!
Pluto's tail, I am jealous!
The navel of Nebuchadnezzar! Watch yourself,
I am not a slave, of that vain...
Who smoked that Havana?
- Hamilcar?
- Hamilcar.
- Hamilcar, take her away from me, before I crush her, splinter, pulverize her, like the glass of a watch between the gears of a dynamo.
Hail, Caesar Augustus!
Petronius, the arbiter of taste.
# What news do you bring me?
#
- Christians...
You took the triclinium for a smoking room?
Hm?
By the poet! And you who are the poet and artist, you smoke like a steam engine.
If I do not hit you on the head, it's because the top hat is mine.
Caesar, the population complains!
They want bread, oil, sesterces.
Says Terces? Who is Terces?
Chastise these ignorant plebeians, is the advice of Tigellinus.
Tigellinus, are you there?
Stay.
Let's burn Rome, and rebuild it in reinforced concrete.
What do you think of my plan?
Courageous.
Well, I'll go.
Are you leaving? I wanted to dismiss you, it's even better if you're already going.
Here, burn all of Rome, make it a fire well done.
- Caesar, I go.
- Go'.
# Go, go and come back soon, I'll wait here. #
Farewell!
Mucrone!
Mucrone, bring me my lyre.
Caesar, it sounds false.
Of course it is false... That's why it's called a li-ar.
But no matter: brilliant people will improvise without the lire.
Music and words worthy of Nero.
Piripi, Piripi, Piripi!
Poropò, poropò, poropò!
Parapira, parapappa, piraparapappa, piraparapappa, piraparapappapà!
I'm composing the second part.
Parapiraparapappapà, pappapà, pappapà!
Pom, pom, pom...
- I forgot to close the tap.
- Pom...
Tigellinus, the empire is mine.
When you want to poop, make your own empire.
Lie down.
Let's return to antiquity, that would be progress.
- A fire!
- All of Rome!
Light of Helios! Don't you know that was my order?
- Beard of copper! Why did you do this?
- Because Rome is mine!
But what about my savings!
Save my savings!
But I am not the fire brigade.
Wait! I must make a call.
Speaking?
Speaking! Of course!
If I am speaking you must be listening.
You're receiving me?
What reception!
Ha ha ha. No, Miss, connect me to the station... No, no!
Huh? Right now?
All right, go ahead.
- They're coming.
- This is it?
- No, but they're coming.
Already coming. Oh! I admire your diligence.
Yes, I'm speaking with the fire fighters, you fine fighters!
Yes, it's burning! This is Mr. Nero, from the Palatine, yes! What is burning?
Make a knot in your the handkerchief, tell your friends when they arrive!
Huh? No! No!
- You're lying!
Intentionally!
No! - What is it?
- Tell me it's not true! It's not true! - What?
He says a firefighter came and left an umbrella, look...
Huh? But no! These are burning matters!
Man: Death to the arsonist!
All (together): To death!
- (in dialect of Rome) They fight!
- But no, it's there. It's the people!
What... What does this vile multitude want? Mamma Mia!
Mamma Mia!
- We want your blood!
- Take Butter's blood!
Butter, lend me your blood, come!
See? When you need it most, the butter melts away.
Tigellinus, would you burn for me?
Do you not fear my death will make the praetorians revolt?
Man: Death to the mother-killer!
Death to the mother-killer?
I am an orphan!
- Caesar, why do you not flee? - Enough.
The public must forgive me this professional flirting.
At times like this, the actor disappears, and vanity takes over, the vanity of technical theater and cinema.
These internal choruses I seem to have done well, right? But the public did not take them. I will repeat them.
Do it again.
For what I pay them, they do miracles.
I'll make them do it a dozen times.
- Caesar.
- (in dialect of Rome) They want to kill you.
- To make you pay for starting the fire! - But why?
- They told me so.
- They will make me pay? - Yes.
But no! I am insured against fire!
Talk to the people!
Wait, I'll talk to the people.
How exciting, addressing the crowd!
No! Those guys want money! Ah!
The people are mine!
I hold them in my hand!
- 3!
All: 6!
8!
- 4!
You see? It is the people! Make them play, and they bite the bait!
- Look: 5!
Another pint to be refilled!
Nero and players: 6!
6! 6!
Stupid!
Uuuh...
Ignoble mob, is this the reward for the sacrifices made for you?
Go home, prove yourselves men, and tomorrow Rome will be reborn more beautiful and magnificent than before!
Men: Bravo!
You like this word, 'before'?
The people love it when they hear difficult words.
I will repeat it to them:
More beautiful and magnificent than before.
Men:
- More beautiful and magnificent than before!
- More beautiful and magnificent than...
- More beautiful...
- Beautiful, thank you!
- 'you!
Thank'!
The people, when they often say that you are good, will say so even if you do nothing. Look.
Man: Brrr!
- To you and your grandfather.
Tomorrow, tomorrow...
How many tomorrows are there in one month?
Tomorrow there will be large distributions, of wine, oil, of flypaper, and sesterces.
Bread and circles.
Man: bread and circuses!
Look who's speaking gibberish!
But I am made of stronger stuff!
I will give you everything, as long as you don't ask for anything!
Now go, beloved rabble!
Woman: To death!
Public:
Encore! Bis!
How's that?
Gotta hand it to you, Rico. The old bean's working all the time.
- What'll it be, gents?
- Spaghetti and coffee for two.
All right, sir.
What's that gotta do with the price of eggs?
Ah, plenty.
Diamond Pete Montana.
He don't have to waste his time on cheap gas stations. He's somebody.
He's in the big town doing things in a big way.
And look at us.
Just a couple of nobodies, nothing.
Is that what you want, Rico?
A party like that for you?
"Caesar Enrico Bandello.
Honored by his friends. "
I could do all the things that fella does and more.
Only I never got my chance.
And what's there to be afraid of?
When I get in a tight spot, I shoot my way out of it. Why, sure.
Shoot first and argue aftervvards.
You know, this game ain't for guys that's soft.
Yeah, there's money in the big town, all right.
And the women.
Good times, something doing all the time.
Exciting things, you know.
Gee. The clothes I could wear.
And then I'd quit, Rico.
I'd go back to dancing, like I used to before I met you. I don't know.
I ain't made for this sort of thing.
Dancing That's what I wanna do.
Dancing?
And where do they get you?
I don't want no dancing.
I'm figuring on making other people dance.
- Oh, I ain't forgetting about the money.
- Money's okay, but it ain't everything. Be somebody.
Look hard at a bunch of guys and know they'll do anything you tell them.
Have your own way or nothing.
Be somebody.
- You'll get there, Rico. - Yeah.
- You'll show them.
- You know this was our last stand in this burg. We're pulling out.
- Where are we going?
- East.
Where things break big.
So I beat it east, like I told you.
That's all there is to it.
I wanna run with your mob, if you'll let me. What do you say?
You won't be sorry for letting me in. I'll do anything you say.
I ain't afraid of nothing.
You think you're a hard guy?
There's nothing soft about me. Nothing yellow. I don't quit.
- You got an idea you're good, huh?
Give me a chance to show you.
- What do you know about me?
- Oh, I heard plenty.
How you run things this end of town.
About this here Club Palermo, how it's your front. I got told enough.
- I guess you're good with a rod too, huh?
- Quick with it and sure.
Well, that don't go around here.
That's old stuff.
This ain't the sticks.
Yeah, I get you.
All right. You stick around.
But, remember, I'm the boss. And I give all the orders.
And when we split, we split my way.
- And no squawks. You get me?
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Vettori.
- All right, come on in, meet the boys.
Oh, they're 100 percent, all right.
Every one of them.
There's Tony Passa. Can drive a car better than any mug in the town.
He's little, but he's the goods, all right.
Bat Carilla.
Killer Peppi.
Kid Bean.
And this one here, Scabby.
What a smart guy he is.
Come on, Tony. Wake up.
I want you to meet a new guy what's gonna be with us.
This is, uh... _Uh_
- Caesar Enrico Bandello.
Oh, Little Caesar, huh?
Where did you get the new dancer, DeVoss?
Olga brought him around a few days ago.
- I'll say he is.
Well, I got hold of a real dancer for a partner, didn't I, Mr. Devoss?
He's an elegant dancer.
We'll panic them after a few rehearsals.
Say, you're not trying to sell him to me, are you, Olga?
Well, young fella, I guess 100 a week ought to buy you.
That's more than I generally start with.
That's swell with me, even though it don't buy no limousines.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Devoss.
You'll never be sorry for this.
Come, Joey.
So it's you and me from now on.
Well, I'm glad. And I'm not ashamed to tell you.
I guess you know by this time how I feel about you.
That's all right with you, isn't it?
Or have you got another girl? A steady, I mean.
RAUGHS]
Hundreds of them, sure.
Only, what's the difference?
This is gonna be real.
- We'll make it mean something.
- Yeah, Joey, let's.
Because I need somebody. Somebody like you.
Awful bad.
- You believe me, Olga?
- I want to believe you.
What you got there, Joe?
Can't you forget you've seen it?
It won't make no difference. Not between us, Olga.
Heh-heh, don't worry, baby.
It's just a little good-luck charm I carry around with me.
Is that your racket?
I suppose I got no right to ask you, Joe.
But now... Now that we got an understanding.
Couldn't you leave it?
I suppose I haven't got the right.
What would be the good of you asking, kid?
Once in a gang...
- You know the rest.
- I don't want to know.
Maybe it could be different this time. If we try.
I've never seen the guy that could get away with it yet.
Sam Vettori is still waiting for you in your office.
All right, I guess I'll have to see him.
I wonder what he wants here.
Hey, Ritz.
You'd better stick with me. I'll need you in there.
- That Sam Vettori's a no-good lug.
- You said it, boss.
Better let me go first.
Cut that.
Hello, Arnie.
Surprised to see me in your swell joint?
Maybe I won't be after you tell me what you want here.
Oh, I'll tell you, all right.
Diamond Pete asked me to come up. He's coming up too.
- Pete Montana?
That's who.
Well, if Pete wants you here, it's got to be all right with me.
- Hello, Mr. Montana.
- Hello, Arnie.
Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Vettori.
- Hello, boss.
Sit down, boys. I got something to tell you.
A message from the Big Boy.
Now, listen. Here's the lowdown.
- The Big Boy says- - Just a minute, boss.
Hey, you.
Nobody asked you to be butting in here, did they?
- Screw, mug.
- You ain't giving me orders. You're a fresh guy, huh?
- Take it easy, Rico.
You go out there and wait for me.
Jake with me, boss.
Now, listen, boys.
Watch this guy McClure what's head of the new crime commission.
He's putting the screws on, and make no mistake about him.
Now, the Big Boy wants me to tell you guys to put the chains on your gorillas for the next few months.
Because if any of them go too far, it'll be just too bad. Ah, heh.
I've never seen nobody the Big Boy couldn't get to.
He can fix anything.
That's why he's the Big Boy.
This bird McClure will be pie for him.
- He'll twist him around his little finger.
- Don't kid yourself.
Nobody's squaring nothing with McClure.
Not even the Big Boy.
Small jobs, that's different.
We could spring guys for them.
Butshoofing? No, sir.
It's guys like this torpedo of yours that cause all the trouble.
Who, Rico? Heh-heh.
He's all right.
He's a little quick on the trigger, but that's because he's new.
Well, it's us that'll swing for him if he shoots at the wrong time.
Now, remember what I told you.
And you.
You take it easy with that cannon of yours.
Did you hear me?
- Good night. - Good night.
Do yourself a favor, will you, Rico?
Leave your gat home on the piano the next job you pull.
Yeah, park it next to your milk bottle. Hey.
Run your own mob, Arnie. I'll take care of mine.
Yeah, I'll park it.
I don't need no cannon to take care of guys like you, Mr. Lorch.
Yeah, we gotta be careful.
Little Arnie's interested in this here nightclub.
- If it ever gets out who pulled the job- - They'll never get wise to us.
They're careless, but they've never been tapped.
Yeah, but I don't like the whole business.
Neither do I, Sam.
Honest, I don't.
I couldn't sleep last night. I was up worried.
I don't want to take any chances. Not now the way they're closing down on us.
What's the matter, Tony, getting yellow?
No, but, jeez, none of us wanna hang, do we?
You'd like to quit, wouldn't you?
You'd like to run out on us.
- You're yellow, you dirty-
- Wait a minute, Rico.
Where do you get that yellow stuff?
You want to know who's yellow, I'll tell you.
Joe Massara, your pal.
- That's why he didn't show tonight. - He'll be here.
Just because-
I know all about that stuff.
I'm gonna give him 10 minutes more. Then we'll see.
Now, listen, Sam, Joe's all right.
He's the best front man in the world.
Why, he can go to a swell hotel and order a suite, a suite, and it's all right.
Without Joe, we can't pull the job, and you know it.
What's that paper?
It's this layout I've been figuring out with Scabby.
- What, this nightclub job? - Yeah.
Well, let me see it.
And until I say different nobody's gonna plan for this mob but me.
You get me?
He'll learn.
Now, come here, you guys.
Now, get this.
I told you to be here at 8:30.
Oh, well, you see, I-
I was busy.
I was rehearsing, and...
- Oh, you know how it is.
- Yeah, I know how it is.
They've been saying it, only I didn't believe them.
They're crazy when they call you yellow.
Tell them they can go to-
Say, what's the big idea of the rush anyway?
It's a little job we need you for.
A little job at the Bronze Peacock.
Are you trying to kid me or something?
How can I take the chance? They're all my friends, they all know me.
That's why, they'll never suspect you.
Now, don't stall, Joe.
I ain't stalling.
You gotta get me out of this, Rico.
Well, don't you see, I'm working steady now, and...
Can't a guy ever say he's through?
You're gonna be in on this, and you'll like it.
The time is to be sharp midnight on New Year's Eve.
I won't. I can't.
I can't, don't you see?
Well, gee, I- - I'll be working New Year's Eve.
- Now, listen, Joe.
This is the joint where you're working.
And don't you be forgetting it, either.
Come on in.
Well, maybe it ain't so hot.
- Maybe we can't buck Little Arnie.
Ah, you're too good, that's what.
You were in a big hurry about getting here, weren't you?
- Maybe this kind of work ain't to your liking.
- Joe's all right.
He's in with us.
Yeah, I'm in with you.
Well, let's see, now.
Here's the way I dope this thing out.
I, Sam Vettori, not you, Rico, or nobody else.
- That's plain, ain't it?
Only, who stands here?
You kind of forgot that, didn't you?
Hey, I'm boss on this job, not you.
Smart guy, Rico.
He's got plenty of brains.
I tell you, I'm afraid, Otero.
Ah, you're crazy.
Rico's coming with us.
Come on now, buck up.
And you, Joe.
You'll be in the lobby and give us the high sign if everything's on the up and up.
Yeah, and if we get in a jam, you'll have to take a chance with the rest of us.
Hey, quiet, quiet.
Holy Moses, it's Alvin McClure. The crime commission buzzard.
Hey, Devoss. (Some here.
What is it, Arnie?
Bring McClure over here, I want to buy him a lemonade.
- Not tonight, some other time.
Do as you're told.
Go on, DeVoss, bring him here.
As you wish.
What can I order for you?
- Good evening, Mr. McClure.
- Good evening, DeVoss.
- Quite a party, eh?
- Thank you.
Delighted to have you with us, folks. Heh-heh.
Mr. McClure, a Mr. Lorch, a financial backer of mine would like to meet you.
- May I bring him over to your table?
- Lorch?
Lorch?
- You mean the man they call Little Arnie? - Yes, but-
- You say he's a financial backer of yours? - Yes, but-
I didn't understand that a man of his type was connected with this place.
I'm sorry, DeVoss, but you might inform Mr. Lorch that we're leaving.
I came to this place under a misapprehension. - Now, Mr. McClure-
- I'm sorry, folks but we'll have to go somewhere else.
You like my hair this way, Joey?
I used to wear it- Where are you going?
- Just to get a package of cigarettes.
- Hurry back, darling, it's almost 12:00 ...and I wanna be with you for New Year's.
Stay where you are.
Open her up, Tony, this ain't no picnic.
What's the matter, Tony, losing your nerve?
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, we gotta get out of here.
Why, Joe...
- The joint's been held up, that's all.
- Held up?
- They shot McClure.
- Joe. - Now you know. - It was you.
No, it's a lie!
I-
- You shot McClure.
No, I didn't, I swear. It wasn't me that shot him.
It was-
But it's our hips for this job, all right.
- Maybe everything will be all right, Joey.
Maybe he wasn't hurt badly.
But you're through with that bunch.
You don't belong, Joe. You're not that kind.
You'll never go near them again.
Olga you can't go back on a gang.
Well, everything come off all right?
Everything was all right. Only I had to take care of a guy. - Who was it?
- McClure.
McClure.
You shot McClure.
A million guys in this town, and you had to pick the crime commissioner.
What did I tell you, Rico? Didn't I say to make it clean?
Didn't I say no gunplay?
Think I'm going to let a guy pull a gat on me?
Any more of these cracks, and this is my last job.
The head of the crime commission.
The Big Boy can't do us no good this trip.
They'll get us dead sure now.
- Why don't you go and give yourself up?
You're slipping, Sam.
And Tony, what about him?
Where is he?
Getting rid of the car.
Tony got nervous. He's like a big baby
What a fine pickle we're in.
You and that rod of yours.
Flaherty's downstairs, a couple of dicks with him
They're coming right up.
Stay where you are, all of you.
They won't know nothing unless they picked Tony up.
I'll be in here listening.
Happy New Year, boys.
Say, there's a lonesome touring car down the street.
I was wondering if you happened to know anything about it.
How should I know anything about it?
- Ain't it got license plates on it?
- Yes, but they're phony.
It was stolen on the north side tonight.
Oh, I got a good café business.
I don't know nothing about automobiles what's been stolen.
Well, you might if some of the bright young men around here had anything to do with it, wouldn't you?
- Wasn't there anybody in it?
- Yes, one guy.
But not when we got there. He beat it.
But we got a good description of him, though.
I'm telling you, I don't know nothing about it.
Well, come on, fellas.
As long as Vettori doesn't know anything about it.
Oh, say, have you heard the news, Vettori?
Someone knocked off Alvin McClure over at the Bronze Peacock.
McClure?
No, that's terrible.
Some guys are sure careless with the lead, all right. What a tough break for Arnie.
It's gonna be a tough break for a lot of birds.
Well, so long.
Oh, I forgot to wish you fellas a merry Christmas.
Tony, I can't figure him.
The kid's a great driver. - Oh, he must've lost his nerve.
- I'll take care of him.
- Let's see the color of that money.
- Just a minute, Sam.
I got my own ideas of a split. And you can take it or leave it.
- We ain't begging you.
- Yeah, well, I bossed this job and I'm gonna get my split.
How'd you boss this job?
By sitting here cheating at solitaire?
Well, that don't go no more, not with me. We're done.
- I've been taking orders from you too long.
- You'll keep on taking orders too...
- ... or you'll get out of here so fast...
- Maybe it won't be me that gets out. No?
Well, maybe the boys have got something to say about that.
What about it?
So that's it, huh?
Yeah, that's it, all right.
You can dish it out, but you're getting so you can't take it no more. You're through.
Well, the split's okay with me, Rico.
No hard feelings, eh, Sam?
We gotta stick together.
There's a rope around my neck right now, and they only hang you once.
If anybody turns yellow and squeals my gun's gonna speak its piece.
What's the matter, Antonio?
Why you don't sleep?
- You sick, maybe? Huh? - Yeah.
- Oh, what-?
- No, can't a guy get up when he wants to without answering a lot of questions?
You stay out late nights, you drink lot of wine.
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, listen, Antonio, I-
I have some spaghetti for you on the stove.
If you feel better, eat some. Yes? It do you good.
You used to be a good boy, Antonio.
Remember when you sing in the church? In the choir with Father McNeil?
You in white.
Father McNeil.
The church was beautiful.
You little boy with long hair.
The tall, big candles.
Remember, Antonio?
Don't leave me, Ma, do you hear?
You don't have to go now, do you?
Can't you stay a little while with me?
Please, don't go away.
- Oh, Antonio. Oh, my baby. I no go, I stay.
I'll be all right, Ma.
- You'd better run along, do you hear? - Yes. You run along.
Take good care of yourself, will you, huh?
And give my love to Miss Manccia, will you, huh?
Father McNeil.
I'm looking all over for you.
Rico wants you to come and get your split.
What's the matter, Tony?
Don't you want a split?
And I don't want no split.
Rico knows you lose your nerve
Now, he wants you to be a man.
You better not turn yellow.
Get away from me, Otero.
Leave me alone! Listen, kid.
I'm trying to tell you for your own good.
- Come with me and get your split. - Ah!
Hey, TOW!
Tony, where you going?
I'm going to see Father McNeil.
I found Tony, but it's too late. He's crazy!
Crazy!
I tell him to be a man, but he shakes his head and goes to the priest.
Well, I guess that's that.
We ain't got any time to lose.
Come on, Sam, get a car, and let's go.
Not me!
Take
- Take Scabby.
- Scabby's no good. No. I'm not.
- Can you drive, Otero?
All right, let's go.
We'll use the black roadster.
Did you see all them wreaths?
That hearse is sure decked out pretty.
Well, this was no time to be tight with money.
Tony deserved a swell send-off.
- Poor kid.
- Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all. It was big.
And all it had on it was "Tony. "
- Not even Rico's name.
- Yeah. Rico's no braggart.
Tony looked like he was asleep.
Didn't look a bit changed.
Beats me how they do it.
- Look, Rico.
There's Flaherty, the bull.
Things must be getting pretty hot.
What's he want?
He's just stalling. They ain't got a thing on me.
Gee, we're moving slow.
The banquet won't start until 8.
Too bad Tony won't be there.
Yeah, that's the goods, all right. That's the fanciest I've ever seen, Sam.
Look at those little turtledoves down here.
Friendship and loyalty, huh?
- Well, how do you like that, Sam? Huh? Pretty good, Rico.
Otero told me I don't look good in a derby.
- Looks just like you. - I thought so.
I guess I'll stick to them from now on.
"Compliments to a true pal. Mr. C. Bandello from a true pal Mr. Sam Vettori. " Well, that's nice.
I appreciate, Sam.
That's swell of you.
What's the matter with you birds?
Don't you know how to act at a banquet?
What do you think you are, a lot of gashouse yaps?
Well, cut the chatter.
Scabby's gonna make a speech.
Well, folks you all know what we're here for so what's the good of me telling you all about it?
Rico here is a great guy!
Sure, and, uh...
Say, Rico I don't know how to talk fancy, but...
This here watch is for you, see?
- From the boys! - Come on, everybody.
Clap, like.
Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, well. All right.
You birds want me to make a speech?
Here it goes.
- I want to thank you, fellas, for this here banquet.
It sure is swell.
The liquor is good, so they tell me.
But I don't drink it, myself.
And the food don't leave nothing to be desired.
Well, I guess we're all having a swell time and it sure is good to see all you gents with your molls here.
I guess that's about all.
And I wish you birds wouldn't get drunk and raise Cain because that's the way a lot of birds get bumped off. Yeah.
Lay off that stuff. I know what I'm-
A couple of newspaper guys out there want to take a picture. What do you say, boss?
Well, what do you think of that, huh? Heh. Sure.
Send them in. Tell them to make it snappy.
- I'll see you later.
- Oh, don't go away.
- I haven't had my picture taken in the last 15 years.
Well, what do you think of that?
Fifteen years, he hasn't-
Come on, boys, make it snappy.
There you are.
Now, hold it.
Hold it, still!
- Look at the guys over there. - That was a bad play you made then, Rico. That flashlight.
- They might pick you up on that.
- Well, what do I care?
Don't I want folks to see what the boys think of me?
Hey, Rico, what become of that pal of yours, that dancer guy, Joe Massara?
He ain't been around in a long time.
He didn't quit on you, did he, Rico?
Bad business to quit on me, Sam.
One guy tried that on me once.
Now, you mind your own business and let me tend to my own.
What does that bull want in here?
- I'll show him where he gets off.
- Careful, Rico.
Who invited you here?
You're getting up in the world, aren't you, Rico?
The downstairs is open to anybody, even cops.
But the upstairs is private.
Thanks, but I like to keep my eye on you, Rico.
You see, I'm your friend.
I like to see a young fellow getting up in the world that's all.
I Will.
Oh, say...
Somebody threw a brick through Meyer Blum's window last night.
Do you happen to know anything about a diamond-and-platinum watch that was stolen, do you?
If you hear anything about it, let me know, won't you?
Banquet, eh?
Rico got far too far.
So now he's got to stop.
I'm saying he's got to stop!
Oh, Arnie, are you fellas going to start another scrap?
What's the use of my paying heavy dues for protection... - ... if there's no peace?
There'll be peace soon enough.
I'm saying he's got to stop, so he's gonna stop.
He's been cutting in on my territory and that's all wet with me.
Look, ahem.
I'm sitting here, see?
I'm sitting here quiet smoking a cigarette, see?
But a couple of my boys ain't sitting here.
They're out looking for Rico, and they got their gats with them too.
Catch on?
And when they find him, it won't be no banquet that Rico gets. It will be a wake!
Arnie, you know best.
I've never met Rico.
Phelps, 2284.
Hello, Otero.
This is Joe Massara.
I just found out something. This is hot.
Tell Rico to look out.
Little Arnie's gang is out to put one in him.
- Where is Rico? - You got me.
He ain't showed up yet.
Come on, quick!
We got to find him!
I want 10 of these.
Gee, you taking all these papers, Mr. Rico?
Why, sure.
Ain't I got my picture in them?
- Thanks! Come again!
Fine shots you are!
So somebody finally put one in you.
Yeah, but they just grazed me.
The old man will be glad to hear it.
He takes such an interest in you.
Tell him the cops couldn't get me no other way, so they hired a couple of gunmen.
If I wasn't on the force, I'd have done the job cheap.
Did you ever think how you'd look with a lily in your hand?
I've been in this game a good many years, and I put the cuffs on a lot of mugs.
Someday, you and I are gonna take a ride, Rico and when we do, I'll have the cuffs on you too.
No buzzard like you will ever put any cuffs on Rico.
I'm gonna get that swell-headed mug if it's the last thing I ever do.
Boss, I'm sorry. I should have been with you.
They thought they hit the target, boss, but bullets just bounce off of you.
It was Little Arnie, Rico.
Joe Massara got the tip, and he called up. We couldn't find you in time.
Joe,huh?
I didn't think he cared enough.
Well, that was white of him, all right.
I ought to give him a chance on my next job.
Guess I didn't study medicine for nothing, did I?
Thanks, Scabby.
I'm going to see Little Arnie tonight.
If he's looking for trouble, why, that's what we got the most of.
I want Killer Peppi, Otero, Kid Bean and Bat to go with me.
Listen, handsome, open up, or you'll tell nobody nothing no more.
Tell him we're all right, and don't act nervous.
These fellas are all right.
Come on, stick them up.
Lock that door.
Where's Arnie?
In the office?
Bat, stay outside that door and don't let anybody in.
Kid, you keep them covered.
Peppi and Otero, follow me.
Come on, you. Give him the knock.
Put them up!
Put them up!
Come on!
- How's business? - What's the game?
I don't know what this is all about, but it's a private row.
- You guys better beat it.
- Ain't nobody gonna leave this room.
You guys are invited to this private party.
Suppose we don't want to stay?
I wouldn't stop you for the world.
Only these boys of mine have itching fingers.
Sit down, gents.
Arnie you ought to have better sense than to hire a couple of outside yaps especially bad shots.
What is it? Let's have it!
Arnie you're through.
You hire these mugs, they miss. Now you're through.
If you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning you won't ever leave it except in a pine box.
I'm taking over this territory.
From now on, it's mine.
You're growing, Rico.
So this is what you've been after all the time, huh?
I seen it in your eyes the first time I met you.
You're no good, Rico.
If you think you can muscle in on me like you did on Sam Vettori, you're off your nut!
I suppose you forgot all about Pete Montana, huh?
How's Diamond Pete going to stop me?
He may be your boss, but he ain't mine.
Sam didn't feel that way about him.
- Sam knew who gave orders.
- Sam was too soft.
Diamond Pete could scare him, but I ain't no Sam.
Sam is through.
Now you're through too.
Nice stickpin you got there, Arnie.
Nothing phony about my jewelry.
Arnie you better quit this racket.
You can dish it out, but you got so that you can't take it no more.
You'd better take your hats and beat it.
The first thing you know, you'll be arrested for firing a rod in the city limits.
Well I guess that's about all.
Pleasant trip, gents.
Oh, thanks, boys, for the artillery.
- Well, boys. What do you think of it?
- Scabby, you're in the wrong job.
That means you have a new partner.
Little Caesar.
Everybody'll laugh at Scabby's story.
Gee, boss. You gave Arnie an awful walloping.
Rico...
Now you're famous.
You see, Otero.
There ain't no use in being scared of any of these big guys.
The bigger they come, the harder they fall. Hmph.
I ain't doing so bad in this business so far.
Well, now.
Ah, you look great, boss.
Yeah, but it feels terrible.
You're getting up in the world, Rico.
None of us ever been invited up to eat at the Big Boy's dump.
And nobody ever crashed the gate except Pete Montana. See what I mean?
Now, you don't want the Big Boy to think you ain't got no class.
They rig you up better than this in the stir.
If you think I'm going out in this, you're crazy!
You look fine, boss. - Go on.
Take a peek at yourself.
- Oh, I don't know.
All I need is a napkin over my arm.
Now, don't you look fine?
I guess maybe I don't look so bad after all.
Oh, hello.
- Hello, Big Boy.
Hello, Rico.
Yeah. Thanks.
Well, you're rather lit up tonight, aren't you?
Yeah. I thought I better put on a monkey suit.
That's right. You may as well learn now.
Some joint you got here.
I bet all this trick furniture set you back plenty, huh?
Well, they don't exactly give it away with cigar coupons.
Well, I'll tell the world. Heh.
Boy, it sure look-
Oh, look at that.
Do you like it?
Oh, I think it's elegant.
That cost me $15,000.
Fifteen thou-
Boy, them gold frames sure cost plenty of dough.
Well, will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy?
Oh, no, thanks.
- No?
- Heh, no.
- Cigar, then? - Oh, yeah.
I'll have one of those.
- Sit down, Rico.
Now, listen, Rico.
I'm gonna talk to you, but you're not gonna hear a word I say, see?
This is inside dope, and if it gets out, it'll be just too bad for somebody.
All right. Get this.
Pete Montana's through.
- And I thought he was such a big guy.
- He's through.
Suppose I were to tell you that from now on you were Pete Montana.
That you were to take over his territory in addition to your own.
Would you shake on it?
Would I?
All right. It's set.
I'm doing a lot for you, Rico, but when I get you planted I'll expect plenty of service.
Well, you'll sure get it.
Permit me, then, to drink to the new boss of the North Side.
Thank you. Heh.
Otero, what did I tell you, huh?
I knew he had his eyes on me all the time.
And let me tell you something, Otero.
It's not only Pete Montana that's through, but the Big Boy himself.
He ain't what he used to be.
Pretty soon, he won't be able to take it, and then watch me.
Sure, boss.
Pretty soon, you'll be running the whole town.
Otero, you said a mouthful.
There's a guy by the name of Massara out there.
He wants to see you, sir.
- I'll see him in a minute.
What's Joe want here?
He hasn't been near any of us for months.
I sent for him.
I heard somebody in Detroit got to Flaherty and told him to start working on a dancer at the Bronze Peacock if he wanted to find out who shot McClure.
Gee, boss, you're wise to everything before it happens.
Yeah, I don't miss much.
I'll soon find out if Flaherty's been working on Joe after I have a little talk with him.
Gee, Rico, what a palace.
Yeah, it'll do.
But what do you expect?
Ain't I got 20 grand tied up in it?
- Hello, Otero.
How are you, baby? - First-rate.
Sit down, Joe.
Sure I'm good enough to sit in such a swell chair?
Come on, now. Cut the comedy. Sit down.
Screw, Otero.
- I want to talk with Joe private.
- Sure.
See you later, Joe.
- Cigar, Joe?
Well, will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy? No.
Well, it surprise you to hear from me?
I thought it would be kind of nice to have a little talk together like old times.
Certainly is nice to see you, Rico.
Especially like this.
- You're looking good.
- You're looking good too, Joe.
Living easy, kind of, huh?
- Not that easy.
Dancing's no cinch.
- Yeah, but you ain't complaining.
- No. No, I ain't complaining.
Dancing's all right for a sideline. It gives you a swell front.
But it ain't my idea of a man's game.
What's the difference, Rico?
As long as I ain't kicking, why should you kick?
Who's kicking?
Only why should a young guy like you be wasting his time?
And I kind of took pride in you, Joe brought you into the gang, pushed you ahead.
We got to go into that again?
Can't you just forget about me?
I don't want to forget, Joe.
You're my pal.
We started off together, didn't we?
We've got to keep going along together.
Who else do I got to give a hang about?
I need you, Joe.
I've got the biggest chance of my life.
The Big Boyjust handed me the whole North Side but it's too much for one man to handle alone.
I need somebody, a guy like you...
- ... somebody I can trust.
- Can't be me, Rico.
I've quit.
You didn't quit.
Nobody ever quit me.
You're still in my gang, you got that?
I don't care how many fancy skirts you've got hanging on to you. That jane's made a softy out of you.
- You lay off Olga.
- I ain't laying off. I'm after her!
One of us has to lose, and it won't be me. There's ways of stopping that dame.
- You're crazy.
Leave her out of this!
- She's through, out of the way. - You're lying.
- I wouldn't? - I'll show you!
- Rico, listen.
We're in love with one another.
Don't that mean nothing?
Nothing. Less than nothing.
Soft stuff!
When she's got you, you ain't no good for anything.
We ain't out of this yet and we don't want no softies spilling things!
I won't spill anything, if you're scared of that.
- You think I want my neck stretched? - Well, you know too much.
I ain't gonna take any chances.
You're hanging around with me, see?
No, I'm not.
You go back to that dame and it's suicide.
Suicide for both of you.
Just stick here.
No, I don't want that guy. I don't trust him.
I got a kid by the name of Joe Massara who'll help me.
All right, goodbye, Big Boy.
- Olga. - We've gotta go.
- Joe, what's the matter?
Didn't you hear what I said? Hurry!
Hurry! - Yes, Joe.
Oh, you're ill.
- I'm all right. - Rico.
- What did he do to you?
Oh, didn't I know it?
He, Rico- He said you and me got to quit.
He'd kill you unless I stuck with him.
We've got to get out of here.
Anywhere. As long as we get away!
You're not coming? - No.
That's not the way.
But, Olga, you don't know that guy!
- Olga, you've got to! Please! - No.
- We've got to think.
- I don't want to think or sit down.
- You're coming.
- Don't you see? It would be no use! Where?
Where would we go?
Where would we run to?
There's no place he wouldn't find us.
There's only one thing for us to do.
Flaherty
You think that would save us? Flaherty?
That's worse than suicide
- I won't do it. I can't.
- Well, I can do it.
That gang must go. Rico must go.
I want my happiness, Joe.
I want you. We'll never have peace till Rico's gone.
I'm going to do it. Olga, don't!
Please! Stay here!
Olga, open this door! Olga, open this door!
Hurry! Park, 1000.
Olga.
Don't call Flaherty.
Please open this door, quickly!
Rico will kill us both!
Headquarters, I want Sergeant Flaherty.
Sergeant Flaherty, this is Olga Stassoff.
I've got Joe Massara with me. In my apartment. 17 Edsel Drive.
Yes, he wants to talk to you.
Hurry, hurry!
Come on, boys, we're going to a party. Who's giving the party?
- Joe Massara.
- Formal or informal?
I don't know, but we'll find out when we get there.
You shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have.
There was no other way. No other right way.
- It's the rope for me. - No, it isn't.
Not if you turn state's evidence.
We'll make them promise everything will be okay.
Wait, Olga!
There he is, the dirty double-crosser.
Give it to him, Rico!
Shoot, Rico.
Come on, Otero! Let's go!
You're getting soft too.
What's the matter with you?
Come on!
- Who was it? - Otero!
He and Rico. Through the window!
Go on, boys. Go and get him!
Are you ready to talk now, Joe?
Well, I'll talk.
It was Rico's gang that held up the Bronze Peacock.
It was Rico who shot McClure.
That dirty, low, sneaking- Well, Joe will tell you.
Ask him.
He knows it was Rico.
Is that right, Joe?
Was it Rico?
- Where's your phone?
Oh, Joe. Here, let me help you.
Park, 1000.
Hello, Dan, this is Flaherty.
Round up that Palermo gang.
I got enough on them to use a mile of rope.
Shoot the cars right out, and above all, get Rico.
We've gotta watch our step.
The cops are sure to be cruising around.
- You should have plugged Joe. - And the dame.
If they ain't squealed about McClure yet, they'll do it now.
- From now on, we're hot. - Yeah.
This is what I get for liking a guy too much.
Come on.
Go on, Rico.
I'm done for.
Joe Massara!
They nabbed him over the McClure business, and he squawked.
Rico tried to get him. Now they're after him.
They got Otero.
- Sam, don't you get me?
- What are you sitting there for?
- What else can I do?
I can't run now. They'd get me anyhow.
You're out of your head.
Come on, get up. Let's beat it!
Put them up! Don't move!
Hand over your guns.
All right. Take them down to the car.
You'd better give up, Sam.
Drop that gun before we start shooting.
Get on your feet and put your hands up.
Put the cuffs on him.
You ain't got nothing on me.
Nothing but the bracelets.
And we haven't got a thing on Rico, either.
He's next.
- There's nobody in there.
Well, listen, Ma.
If you see Rico, you'd better let us know, quick.
Well you got yourself in a nice fix.
- Yeah. - The cops were just here.
- They got Otero.
Ma, I'm gonna stay here a day or two, then I want a car.
Gonna cost you big, because I'm taking big chances.
I got 10 grand planted here. Help yourself.
When you're ready to start, I'll give you $150.
You'll give me?
Whose money is this? Who do you think you're talking to?
I need plenty.
My money is hidden in the apartment.
I'll give you $150.
Why, you dirty, thieving old hag, I'll-
No, you won't.
Because I'm the only one knows where the money's hid.
Kill me, and you won't get a cent.
I'll give you $150 if you'll be a good boy.
He was mean, Sam Vettori was.
So now he's got what was coming to him.
What does it say in the paper?
"Former gang chief faints on scaffold.
After a futile battle in the courts Sam Vettori, former gang leader today presented a pitiful figure as the hangman's noose was placed around his neck. "
Listen. "Little Caesar has never been found.
Flaherty stated further that Little Caesar has contradicted his oft-repeated boast that he could dish it out and take it too. " Yeah.
"When a real crisis arose Rico couldn't take it.
Flaherty ended his interview by remarking:
'Meteoric as was Rico's rise from the gutter it was inevitable that he should return there. "' Eh.
Well, just the same, he was the real leader of that gang.
Don't you believe it.
Rico didn't have the nerve, and he didn't have the brains.
He was yellow, just like Flaherty said.
- Give me that paper!
Hey, watch it!
Must be crazy.
I'll show them where they get off.
Trying to put that kind of stuff about me in the papers, huh?
I'll show them - Hello?
I want Park, 1000. Yeah.
Yeah, I can't take it no more, huh?
I'll tell that guy where to- Hello?
Park, 1000?
- Get me Flaherty, and get him quick.
- Sure. Just a minute.
I may be screwy, but this sounds like Rico.
- Flaherty speaking.
- Yeah, this is Rico speaking!
R-I-C-O, Rico!
Little Caesar, that's who!
You're a big guy, ain't you? Shooting your mouth off in the papers.
So I ran out when it got hot, huh?
I can't take it no more?
Well, listen, you crummy, flatfooted copper I'll show you whether I lost my nerve.
Thanks, Rico, old boy.
The same to you and many of them.
Come on, tell me some more.
The sound of your voice does my heart good.
Trace that call. Find out where he's phoning from, quick.
Say, why didn't you come to Sam's neck-stretching party, Rico?
It was a big success.
Funny guy, ain't you, Flaherty?
Well, you ain't got much longer to laugh.
I'm coming, and I'm gonna put one in your dirty hide for every lying crack that you made about me, see?
I'll show you who's gonna finish up in the gutter.
We've missed you, Rico.
The town has been nice and quiet.
I'm putting on weight.
River, 6547.
It's a flophouse down at 4th and Commercial.
All right. All right, big mouth.
Get your hat and star': running, see, because you're all through.
Call the papers and tell them that, you rotten, dirty, lying copper!
I knew we'd hear from that guy if I kept giving it to him in the papers.
The conceit of that guy.
They'll have to build a special noose to get that swelled head of his through.
Well, wish me luck.
That's Rico, all right. Pull in there.
You'd better give up, Rico.
You'll have to come and get me.
You'd better be a nice boy, Rico, and come out.
You heard me!
If you want me, come and get me!
I'll be with you in a minute.
Give me that chopper.
This is your last chance, Rico.
Are you coming out, or do you want to be carried out?
Well, Rico, it looks like you and I are going to take that little ride together.
No, we ain't.
I told you a little buzzard like you will never put any cuffs on me.
You should have come out when I told you to, Rico.
Mother of mercy.
Is this the end of Rico?
People ought to be ashamed of them selves, making noise at this hour!
Is there a fire?
Can't they knock more quietly?
Damn window!
Hey, they're knocking at Mrs. Miller's.
That's where Mary Baring is staying.
Here comes a police man!
I could swear I saw one on the corner.
No way, there he is on the other side.
Look, it's Moore!
He seems drunk.
Then let's go down there.
Now, where are my pants?
There!
What's going on here, what's this noise?
I'm looking for my wife, she's here in this house.
- I've come to get her.
She was invited to dine with Mary Baring.
Hey, wait for me, I'm coming with you!
Then Moore will have enough time to sober up.
Nonsense, I'm coming!
Open! Open, please!
Come on, open!
You did this!
You've always hated her!
You! You did it!
Sir, pull yourself together.
It is no use.
- Let me be...
Is there any brandy in the house?
Empty, not a drop.
- Is the deceased your tenant?
Ms. Baring is my tenant.
We had invited Mrs. Moore for supper.
The thing is, officer, these two women are actually, like all of us here, part of the company of actors at the Royal Theatre.
I was there tonight. You see, I am the manager, and...
Yes, yes, and I'm an actress. I'm his wife.
And I was also invited here tonight, but I had...
Calm down people, one after the other.
Some tea will do you well, dear.
I'll bring you some.
- Shall I light the stove?
I'll put on some more water.
Oh well, now poor Ellen has really had it.
You know, Mrs. Miller, I'll tell you something...
Ellen and Mary didn't get along.
And I know for a fact that they didn't talk for weeks.
Ms. Baring never said anything about that.
But I assure you it's true!
I can't believe she could have done it.
But, come to think of it, she was always hot-tempered.
She resigned because of Ellen.
- Miss Baring?
- Yes!
And Moore rejected her resignation.
And to think that tonight, Ellen was suddenly completely changed.
You can't imagine what change!
She was! Suddenly got the idea to reconcile with Mary Baring.
Mary Baring was very surprised.
But despite that, she invited both Ellen and me to supper.
I suddenly got the impression that the two wanted to be alone.
Apparently Ellen was jealous again that a man was interested in Mary. You understand?
Officer, can I bring her a cup of tea?
No, she'll get something at the police station.
DUE TO SUDDEN ILLNESS THE PARTS PLAYED B Y MARY BARING AND ELLEN MOORE WILL BE REPLACED.
Ms. Baring's understudy is now on stage.
One moment, Brent. Come over here.
The inspector would like to have a word with you.
This is Brent, inspector.
We would like to clarify some points about the murder.
Do you remember if Mrs. Moore and Ms. Baring left the theatre at the same time last night?
Yes, they left together.
I made a remark to Fane, our leading man, about it.
He said it was good news.
Was it unusual?
It was a miracle!
I even told my wife...
Your turn! Your turn!
Which one of the two ladies is Ms. Brent?
You wouldn't have any luck with that lady.
She is a man!
May I introduce you to your biggest admirer, Mr. Fane?
I can assure you, inspector, I am not the other woman!
I'm convinced, Mr. Fane.
They told me that you saw the two ladies yesterday night.
Yes, before I left the theatre.
Then I went straight home.
- Yes, that is, no!
Stewart came with me. He wanted some cigarettes.
No, I think he had lost his cigarette case.
- Your turn!
- Pardon, this is my reply.
- Who is that man?
- That is Stewart.
The one just referred to by Mr. Fane.
A good actor.
- He? Hardly!
- His relationship with the accused?
- Well, so-so.
Is he popular among the ladies?
Ah, you talk of Mr. Stewart?
A little too popular, if you want my opinion.
Though, I don't know if you could call Mrs. Moore a "lady"...
Don't forget that she is dead.
Please, I thought I had a right to tell the truth?
And everyone knows that Ellen Moore and Stewart... Well...
You mean that Mr. Stewart and Mrs. Moore?
- Your turn!
- My reply.
Oh, don't bother! I know my way.
This is not the first time, Reginald.
Excuse me a moment, change of clothes.
- What have they done with her?
- With Mary?
Still at the station, I think.
Has she said anything?
Can I help?
My God, you don't think she really has done it?
Why did they arrested her?
It was to be expected.
I saw it with my own eyes. The blood covered fire poker in her hand, or at least near her.
Stop it!
What's with you, my boy?
The mere mention of blood makes me shudder.
There is still time.
Be calm, my friend.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Mary Baring stands accused for the murder of Ellen Moore.
She has pleaded not guilty.
Your task, ladies and gentlemen, will be to determine whether she is guilty or not.
Needless to say, in the eyes of the law, men and women are equal.
Even a murder committed by a woman must be judged dispassionately by you.
Neither youth nor beauty...
I could certainly not let my self tolerate her demeanour.
And suddenly she gave me such a strange look.
And then... then I can't remember anything else.
- Did you speak about any particular person?
It has nothing to do with this.
Whatever I have done, must have happened when I was not conscious of myself.
I... know nothing more.
The defense stresses that guilt has not been proven and repudiates all charges.
You, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have been able to observe the behaviour of the accused.
The prosecutor has called this behaviour stubborn and indifferent.
But, ladies and gentlemen, only a truly innocent person can be indifferent towards such an accusation.
If you are convinced that the defence represents the facts, it is your duty to release the accused.
However, I must point out that the accused is a talented actress.
Though if you are convinced that she has committed the deed in full consciousness, then I can only remind you of the words of the prosecutor:
that neither beauty nor youth are extenuating circumstances.
Go and consider the facts for yourselves.
It seems unnecessary to examine all the evidence in detail.
With your permission, I'd like to summarise the facts of the case.
It has been established that the defendant and the victim were at odds.
The defendant invited the victim to supper. She wanted reconciliation.
They both drink some and they start discussing a man.
Proof for this is that the landlady heard loud voices.
The defendant admits this, but refuses to reveal the man's name.
But that's not all.
The defendant lost her temper, she grabbed the fire poker and that's how Ellen Moore was murdered.
The prosecutor believes that the facts are beyond doubt.
She was caught in flagranti.
The fire poker by her side, clothes covered with blood.
The empty bottle of brandy and she herself in a half-unconscious state.
What's more, no one else came into the house.
The defence argues that there is a possibility that she could have acted under a fit or something like that.
Surely it is clear that in the evidence for the defence the medical expert put forward the following theory:
We know that under the influence of a very strong emotion, an individual can act without being aware of their actions.
Actions the individual do not remember at all when she regains her normal mental state.
And for which one therefore can not be held accountable...
It's probably best if we all write down our verdicts.
Then we can see how we stand.
Those in the minority can then explain their individual reasons.
And we'll work it out...
Oh... NOT GUILTY. And we'll work it out that way.
GUILTY.
So, here are... seven guilty and three not guilty altogether.
I take it you haven't come to a decision?
This whole case is terrible.
There's too much responsibility put on our shoulders.
Either we can let her go free, but if she's a murderer, that's wrong to society.
Or else we get her hung, and that I find barbaric.
What if we appeal for mercy?
Do you call that mercy?
20 years in prison?
To spend the best years in hell?
Do you even know what jail means?
It takes a civilised society to invent a punishment like that.
I think you exaggerate a bit.
It's no use confusing the issue.
People who commit a crime has got to be punished.
You can't run the world on sentiment.
You're right, but at least you've got to try.
You have to help the guilty, instead of having children and then start wars to get rid of them again.
The world is a reeking pit of sentiment!
Your verdict, Mr. Shackleton.
So now remaining is only the three who voted not guilty.
I'll explain my reasons for the verdict.
The advice of the medical expert is beyond dispute.
Perhaps she is right.
But maybe this condition then will repeat itself, and possibly with the same results.
Yes, that's a point I have not considered.
If she's found innocent and something would happen...
Then we will have blood on our hands!
Do you wish to change your verdict, Mrs. Ward?
And you, dear Mr. Daniels, does your opinion remain the same?
Well, I've got to say I find the whole thing incredible...
Everyone would like to have a girl like her for a daughter.
Do not let your verdict be influenced by this young lady's qualities and their appeal to you.
Yeah, I can understand that, but I mean, I...
This whole story is so terrible!
Leaving your thoughts aside, what is your verdict?
Well... OK...
Then we all agree, With the exception of Sir John.
But you won't influence me as easily as the others, Mr. chairman.
Let's not be too long. Time is money, you know.
Time is money.
In this case even more than that.
A life is at stake.
I'm an actor, not a businessman.
If I take my time, I apologize.
So speak then, Sir John.
I am convinced that Mary Baring tells the truth when he says that she does not remember anything.
Her behaviour during the trial made a deep impression on me.
But don't think that I'm taking the same line as Mr. Daniels here.
He wanted to be gallant.
For my part, I will go further.
To me it's obvious that she did not drink the brandy.
You've forgotten that the doctor said she smelled of alcohol!
But maybe that was from the wine they had for dinner?
It confirms that the two women had been enemies for some time.
He said the accused wanted to attack Mrs. Moore on stage.
It's all proof that she is a violent nature.
But Mr. Fane said the opposite!
Unfortunately his testimony has no value. He seems in love with the accused.
Everything was clear when they found the body,
The fire poker by her side.
And they quarrelled over a man.
What say you, Sir John?
You'll have to keep her personality in mind.
Is she the kind of woman to get drunk?
But there was a bottle of cognac there!
She's not denying that.
Answers, Sir John?
The question is, was someone else in the house that night?
The landlady said no.
The accused says they were alone.
And said that they fought.
It's clear then.
That is not the response of a guilty!
- Caught red-handed!
- Clothes covered in blood!
- You refuse to acknowledge it?
- Waste of time, waste of money.
- Cognac...
- Blood on her hands...
How do you respond to that, Sir John?
Now that the verdict is unanimous, I'll notify the judge.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?
Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?
Mary Baring, do you have anything to add to avoid the death penalty?
It's absurd.
It can't be true.
Oyez, Oyez, Oyez!
Silence while the death sentence is passed upon the prisoner.
This station has received a S.O.S.
We therefore interrupt our program for five minutes.
After the break a concert will...
- Mr. Bennett is here.
- I'm coming.
I'm glad you're back, sir John.
The audience demands you.
And this process has been excellent publicity.
Sure, seeing Ms. Baring again was not all pleasant for you.
She wanted to be our star.
Hardly a year ago.
In a way she's finally achieved it, but in a very dramatic way.
But Bennett!
- Could you bring me my mail?
- Sure.
We continue our program.
The Radio symphony orchestra brings you the overture from Richard Wagner's opera Tristan and
Strange this S.O.S. earlier.
Save our souls.
Save her soul.
Had I been stronger, then I would have convinced everyone.
Why did these fools not see the poor girl like I did?
In court, everyone look different from how they usually look.
What are you thinking?
Who drank the brandy?
Why didn't I put more emphasis on that point?
Easy to say afterwards...
She said she didn't drink the brandy.
Yet she admits she might have committed the murder.
Denying such a detail and letting herself be convicted of murder without protesting.
How do we know that someone else didn't drink the brandy?
Could be!
That is the crucial point!
Have I done the right thing?
- No mail.
Make sure you get hold of my understudy. I won't play.
And call my lawyer.
No wait, I know the number by heart.
Museum 1223.
It's an inquiry into the current whereabouts of the troupe with which Miss Baring was at work.
And locate that small man stage manager, or theatre director or what he was.
I'll see him in my office in the morning.
I thought the trial was over.
It is far from over!
- Oh, it's for the publicity!
- Come on, Bennett. Publicity?
The line is busy
- Publicity?
- Well, why not?
Yes Mr. Brown lives here
Yes, but he is not at home.
He is ill and is in the hospital.
Dr. Meyer?
If I can transmit a message?
But I haven't got a transmitter...
Sir John?
Oh, eh... Wait a second, hold on!
I think Mr. Brown came home just now...
Hey, they're calling on behalf of Sir John!
Yes I'm Mr. Brown.
Good morning, Doctor.
Oh, thank you.
No, no, nothing serious, just a small scratch.
Yes, from the briefcase...
Of course, with pleasure! I'll come at once.
I was about to go to the bank, but never mind.
Yes, at once. Thank you.
Hey, that was about a job.
Oh Bobby, in that case we won't have to pack!
Don't talk about packing.
I have to get dressed!
Bring me my white gloves!
If this works out, then I'll...
- Then!
Ah, Mr. Brown!
Quite good, thank you.
At the Baring trial these last few days, you made a strong impression as a man and as an artist.
That's why I would like to review some details with you.
Has Bennett already told you about your employment?
Yes, I wanted you to work with us as stage manager.
A year's employment.
But we'll talk to Bennett about that.
Thank you very much, I'm lucky...
I mean, how fortunate that I'm free at the moment.
I will do everything I can.
You can be sure that everything will be swell.
So, it's settled then?
Any problems, Mr. Brown?
My wife and I have always worked together... and I thought, if it's not asking too much...
Maybe a small role?
- Where is your wife?
- Waiting downstairs.
Let's have her come up.
- Should I? I can...
- Never mind, I'll call.
Hello? Oh, excuse me, it's a mistake.
Bennett?
Could you send up Mrs. Brown?
Returning to the trial...
I have taken this matter very seriously.
I played a difficult role.
The role of a juryman.
And when the curtain fell on the death penalty
fear gripped me.
This was not theatre, it was life!
And life is not as kind as the theatre
It permits a poor innocent girl to be condemned to death.
Unless art comes to correct life at the last minute.
Do you mean...
That Mary Baring is innocent?
She was convicted only because she did not deny it.
- But I saw...
- What did you see, Mr. Brown?
Mary Baring next to the dead body, confused.
Drunk?
She never drinks.
So someone else must have done the drinking, Mr. Brown.
Why did she go into the other room for the fire poker?
Accused of murdering Mrs. Moore because she didn't deny it.
And everyone is happy.
Without any questions! Without any responsibility!
I'm delighted, Ms. Brown!
It is a pleasure to be here.
Getting some fresh air, seeing some people...
What a wonderful apartment!
And this neighbourhood with all its stores!
You'll have lunch with us?
God, I'm starving!
Harvey, bring us a cocktail.
And then have the lunch served.
Hey, he's hired us, the both of us!
But please, sit down.
I happened to notice that you are unemployed, and...
A toast to our research!
Yes, your husband and I seem to agree that the Baring trial must be approached from a completely different angle.
Ah, to free Mary Baring!
But that's futile, unfortunately.
So you do not share our opinion? That Ms. Baring is innocent?
No, I mean, yes...
Mary Baring was an adorable colleague and I personally never thought her capable of such a thing.
Isn't that true, Bobby? I've always said that no one who knows her could have thought it.
Do you want to take the matter in your own hands, Sir John?
Have you found anything out?
Oh, we would be so delighted if we could be of any help.
I really don't know where to start.
Do you have any ideas, Brown?
Well, I've played in many crime plays, and there the first thing is to lay out a real plan.
But Bobby, why would you have a plan if Sir. John hasn't got one?
No, no, Ms. Brown, please let him.
I'm really in the dark here.
I would very much like your husband to help me.
To begin with, we must return to the scene of the crime.
Do you think you can spare me a few days of your time?
But of course!
Then you could show me where the murder took place.
Do you really think someone else did it?
After all, it's even possible it was a complete stranger.
How so?
If it was not Ms. Miller and not Mary Baring, then there must have been a third person.
This person would have to get in and get out somehow.
Good reasoning!
Most important is to find out if there was someone else at the scene at 1.30 AM, apart from Moore of course.
Bobby, there was a policeman on the corner.
- That doesn't matter, honey...
What policeman?
In the middle of night, we awoke by a terrible banging on the door.
We went to the window to see who made the fuss.
I saw a man on the corner that looked like a policeman.
So I said:
A policeman is coming.
And then Bobby looked outside and saw one too, but that one came from the other side.
- And where did the first one go?
He must have turned the corner and gone back.
- That corner?
You're sure it wasn't the same policeman?
It's impossible.
We lost sight of him for just a short while.
God, it's Moore!
He's gone crazy!
We better get down.
Moore, be reasonable now.
My wife...
Let's go home now.
Excuse me, this gentleman would like to take a look inside your house.
That is, if you don't mind?
- May I?
Here are a few of her things.
I can't send it to her.
Give them to me, I'll bring them to her.
But that's your photo!
Eh, we're not finished yet.
Is it possible to come in from the back of the house?
See for yourself!
The garden begins there.
Over there's the theatre
To me it's seems impossible.
- Yeah, right.
It would have to be an athlete.
And it would have destroyed the plants.
Did Ms. Baring have many visits?
Ms. Brown now and then, and Mr. Stewart and Mr. Fane.
And that funny little man what's his name?
- Tom Brent.
Good afternoon, what's new?
Anything for us?
No nothing special, a broken wash basin in the number 4.
It was certainly one of you.
Who was in that room?
Stewart and Fane, I think.
No, none of us broke that.
This cigarette box was found? You know who it belongs to?
I'll find out who it is.
Can we see that dressing room?
I'd like to see that broken basin.
Ok, come with me.
- What do you see from the window?
- The house on the corner.
I sure would like to know who broke that basin.
Finally we're here.
We wish you a good night's sleep.
I'll come by early in the morning.
It's time to get to bed. Good night.
Oh, be quiet now!
Take it before it spills.
Do you want the plate in bed or on a chair?
What are you doing?
Stop it, leave it be!
Get off of there and leave that bag alone!
Just wait until your father comes home, then you'll see!
That child is too curious.
It earned him a real beating once.
But he hadn't done anything serious.
I wanted Mr. Stewart to describe what happened, but it was during the Baring trial.
My husband found the body, you know.
And he enjoyed the trial.
Ha-ha, Edith is usually not this merry, but she's seems fond of you!
Do you have kids too?
Tell me, why did Mr. Stewart give the child a beating?
Little Arthur was playing with the suitcase, and he took out a police uniform.
He thought it belonged to his father.
And then I heard a terrible scream.
Is that a reason to hit a child?
The next day I told Mr. Fane.
I wanted advice, because I was a bit worried.
But he just turned around and said he knew nothing about it.
I said: If it isn't yours, it must be your colleague Stewart's.
Come in, my dear Brown.
Can we talk a minute?
I'll bring some hot water.
Come on down!
Come on, boys, get out!
Go and play in the street!
Charming house!
- I have something to inform you. - Please.
My wife and I have found something out.
Do you remember the cigarette case the doorman gave us?
Someone had forgotten it. - Yes, yes.
I had put it in my pocket and this morning in bed
I wanted to smoke, so I said to my wife: hand me my cigarettes.
I asked her: do you know who this belongs to?
She looked at it and said:
My God, that's Stewart's case.
Then she saw it had a beer stain
So I said: then I should clean it before returning it.
My wife started rubbing and suddenly said:
That isn't beer, what could it be?
You know what it was? Blood!
Stewart...
Who wears a police uniform in your play?
Fane and Stewart.
Stewart played a policeman.
And in the third act he changed clothes with Fane.
In fact, we had an extra uniform for Fane.
That allowed it to go faster.
So we actually had two police uniforms.
You've become an important factor in this case, Brown.
A very important factor.
The most important factor is the policeman you did not see.
At the night of the murder, your wife saw a policeman on the corner.
When you arrived, it was gone.
And then he reappeared.
It was not the same person!
You can be sure that the first one was not a real policeman.
You mean that someone used one of our theatre uniforms to disguise as a policeman?
We must find out the name of the man Mary is protecting.
Was he a member of the company or someone else?
Anyway, the cigarette case will make her talk.
It is very kind of you to come and see me.
I'm very surprised.
I've taken a great interest in your case, and...
Please, do not talk about it.
How's your new play going?
Even though I was away for a while. You know, as a juror at your trial?
Could you answer a question regarding the case?
I'm convinced that there are grounds for an appeal.
You want to help me with that?
Do you know the consequences?
Appeal...
Lifelong imprisonment.
A single week has driven me half crazy!
If you...
If you want to appeal against the judgment, you should do it.
I've accepted all of this.
But at night...
It can't be much worse than going to the dentist.
And if I really did it in a moment of sickness, then it's better if I go away.
But prison...
If you are my friend, do not attempt anything!
Lock yourself up in your room just for one single day, then you'll understand me.
Tell me, tell me frankly.
You wanted to work with me, to become a famous actress.
This can be achieved if you help me a little.
You can't imagine how I suffer for having contributed to your misery.
And if you want to, Mary, you'll become a great actress.
I'm convinced!
What do you want me to say?
The name of the man who was the subject of the discussion.
He had nothing to do with it and we weren't arguing about him.
I will explain to you.
Ellen wanted to say bad things about him.
And I covered my ears.
So you could not hear if anyone came into the room?
And why did you cover your ears?
- I knew what she would say.
I can not tell you that.
It would hurt someone terribly.
Who has not suffered in this case?
Moore, Fane, Stewart, you and me too!
Why protect that person?
Could you reveal the past of another person without it being a benefit to anyone?
But perhaps that is the way of salvation!
I believe in your innocence!
I beg you, speak.
Do you know what your silence means?
You are in love with this man.
And the one you are protecting is Stewart.
- This is Fane's case.
You're not allowed to give the prisoner anything.
Courage, Mary!
I'll say!
It's him, disguised as a woman.
He's always been good at that.
That's a good disguise.
I have an idea, Brown.
I'll ask Mr. Fane to come to me.
And I'll offer him an important role.
Hey, we've found Fane. He'll surely fall in our trap!
Sure, sure...
Sherlock Holmes is no one compared to you.
Don't be silly, the plan is not mine.
Sir John had an ingenious idea.
He wrote a play for it.
That's the bait. And he'll offer Fane the lead in it.
Any actor would bite the bait.
If he is right and Fane is dangerous, then why are you mixed up in this?
I'm just the prompter!
- Do you have a moment?
This is Mr. Handel Fane.
Ah, this is the gentleman you suggested for the role?
- Please, have a seat.
Do stay Bennett, I might need you.
I'm not good at negotiating.
I always forget the most important details.
Has Bennett told you who is the author of this work?
- I am the writer. - Is that so?
Oh, it was very easy.
The only difficulty was to find the lead actor.
Could you stand up, please?
Just as I've visualised him! That's how he has to look.
I thought so too.
Would you like to read me a few lines from the text?
Just to give me some idea?
This is illegible.
Tell Waldron to bring me another.
May I ask what is the theme of the play?
My taste may surprise you.
But as an artist, you'll understand what tempted me.
It's about what preceded the Baring trial.
You were a member of Moore's company at that time?
Then you know the two women concerned?
Quite well.
Maybe we could start?
At present you're engaged with the Circus Olympia.
Is that an interference?
No, that's my old job.
I'm doing it again only because the times are tough.
Besides, you'll hardly start for another 2 or 3 weeks?
Bennett, if you may?
To give you an idea of the scene...
The table is standing in front of the fireplace, more or less like this is.
On the table, remains of a meal.
Below, a bottle of cognac...
- You know, Mr. Fane...
I'm surprised that this bottle of brandy... has played such an insignificant role in the trial.
As a writer, I'd have given it much more importance.
But of course, the court lacks imagination, right?
I think we'll go to the scene of the murder.
It is preceded by a short dialogue between two women.
While they quarrel, you make your entrance.
The moment one of them says...
And here we quote the statement of a witness:
"I'll tell you things about your protégé, things you do not suspect."
That's when you enter.
Let's start, please.
You enter through the window.
He understands the role, even without looking at the script.
Yes, the script...
Where were we? Ah, yes!
I think it would be better if I have the fire poker with me before entering the room.
Could you give me the fire poker?
Sorry, we only have electric heating here.
Maybe my pen will do?
Yes, this will work.
Enters through the window...
You sneak by the doors...
You slowly approaches...
The two women are facing each other.
You are approaching slowly. Very slowly.
So not to be seen or heard.
The two women are facing each other. You come from behind!
One of them yells:
"I'll tell you..."
The script is not finished.
I was getting myself quite worked up.
- I was hoping you'd help me!
I know nothing about writing.
I'm not one of those actors who contribute to the work of eminent authors.
Complete the scene yourself.
I'll play the end.
I can not be of any help.
Please see what time he performs at the circus tonight.
I'm curious how good a trapeze artist is at playing comedy.
Don't get upset, Bennett.
He'll play his role until the end.
One moment, Sir John.
I'll be with you in a moment.
I did not expect to see you again here, Brown.
- Yes, Sir John hired me...
- He helps me with my new work.
It calms the nerves.
Yes, I have a very demanding role.
You never know what will happen.
It's your turn.
I assume you came here to talk about your play.
That's right.
Hurry, Fane!
Oh, Sir John, it's an honour!
Will you attend the show?
No, thank you. I came to talk to Mr. Fane.
Would you be so kind and wait for me?
I think I can give you a good idea for the end of your play.
Perhaps this letter has something to do with what happened.
It all fits together.
Listen to this, Mr. Brown, here is the end of my play:
By these words, he jumps in with the fire poker in his hand, pushes Mary, whose head hit the table, and collapses, unconscious.
Then he strikes Ellen Moore
And when he sees the bloody corpse, he nearly faints.
He picks up the bottle of cognac and empties it, then returns to the theatre through the window.
In his dressing room, he washes his hands.
And breaks the sink in the process.
To his horror, he sees the crowded street.
That's when he gets the idea:
To get home unnoticed disguised with the police uniform from the theatre.
You see, Brown, there's your policeman.
The rest we know, except for the motive.
The threat of the murdered woman who wanted to reveal his past to the woman he loved.
Poor devil!
Mary Baring had known his secret for a long time.
What was the secret?
He had escaped from prison. And he lived in constant fear of being captured again.
Please, don't cry.

Cinema.
Plan.
Towards socialism.
This happened in Donbass
During the five-year plans era.
In 1930.
There is no coal supplies.
Out-of-stocks.
Lets give back to the country the coal that it deserves.
What are we going to do now?
We need to address this question in a clear way to the production comity, to our best workers.
We have to immediately face the lack of supplies.
Can a man do this on his own?
The local administrator?
The president of the union?
The director of the mine?
The technician, etc.?
Certainly not.
For this, we need the mobilization of the whole Komsomol.
Of all of our best workers, and all the workers in general.
All the people available around the mines shall participate in the common effort to face the lack of supplies.
I, one of the best workers at Snizjanka, from mine n°9 I promise to exceed by the end of the year, last year's incentive of 28000 tons!
The Komsomols arrive on Donbass' front.
The best workers arrive.
Come the enthusiastics.
Comes the metal.
Comes the coal.
In Donbass, an offensive has been launched.
The Soviet Union will fulfill its goals in terms of coal in this decisive year. The third year of the five-year plan.
Coal for the blast furnace.
Coal for the factories.
It is about honour.
It is about glory.
It is about courage and heroism.
We are the fighters of the fire front.
The five-year plan has been executed in four years!
The rolling mill and the open hearth furnace entered the competition.
For the Communist Party!
For the struggle for socialism!
Packed trains are leaving Donbass.
Wagons filled up with coal and steel.
We are the kolkhoziens of Donbass, brigade n°4.
Given our goals in terms of the harvest. We, brigade n°4, we commit ourselves to be amongst the best workers.
We promise to rapidly and neatly execute our harvest.
This is why we call for brigade n°6 to follow our set example.
Socialism for the new generations!
Long live collectivization!
Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!
Long live the best workers' movement!
Let's battle in songs.
I'm 'most frightened to death.
Sure, after you've done it eight or nine times, you won't even give it a thought.
- Gee, Dot, you look swell.
- Am I all right?
dddd Well, there goes the maiden's prayer.
I wonder how I'll act.
It's like diving overboard-you never know how the water's going to be till you hit it.
- I'm so nervous.
- Say... if I could look like you in a wedding gown, I'd be a bigamist.
I say, isn't that girl in the bride's outfit a new model?
Why, yes.
She's a salesgirl downstairs.
We're trying her out.
She's got my okay.
These guys usually make wisecracks.
Don't let it bother you.
I know all the answers- men have been insulting me for years.
Say, beautiful. Doing anything tonight?
I'm taking my two pet fish out for a drive.
There'll be room for another if you'd care to go.
Don't talk back to them.
You'll get fired. When they deliver baloney at my door, I always give them a receipt.
Honestly, if I ever met a fella... that didn't try to date me up right off the bat, I think I'd fall on his neck.
He'd probably be too weak to hold you up.
Oh, men are all alike.
Rich or poor- when it comes to women, they've only got one idea in their head.
Take those fellas out there today- When they didn't try to date you up... you could tell what they were thinking by the way they looked at ya.
And it isn't only those swell society guys either.
Ridin' the subways during the rush hour, fellas brushing' up against you-you know what.
Or sit in the theater.
- Don't I know it?
After all, I guess nature made men that way.
It's their great weakness.
And how we women encourage that weakness.
- Well, I don't.
I know you don't, Dot.
- Oh, Mlss Haley. - Yes, Mr. Thompson.
- Good night, Dot.
Good night. - So long.
I just wanted to tell you how awfully well you did this afternoon.
- Oh, thank you so much, Mr. Thompson.
- You were marvelous.
It's been such a hot day- I thought you might like to take a drive.
Oh, I'd just love to, Mr. Thompson, but, you see... - my husband's a prizefighter.
- Oh. Yes. And he heard about a fella here in the store who tried to make a date with me... and he's waiting downstairs now to beat him up.
Well, you know, when I asked you to take the ride, I had nothing wrong in mind.
Oh, no, Mr. Thompson.
You see, I never think of things like that.
Gee, Dot, that husband prizefighter gag's a pip.
I'm gonna use that one too.
- Don't men ever think of anything else?
- Well, hardly ever.
What are you looking at the river for, baby?
You ain't expecting anybody, are ya?
Yeah, my grandfather's swimming in from Europe tonight.
Well... when the old guy gets here, give him my best regards.
You think you can spare any?
Hey, Dot.
I've got something to show ya.
- There's a fella over here who won't flirt.
- There ain't no such animal.
- On the level.
- His wife must be watching him.
No, he's all alone.
A girl can't get a tumble.
A girl can't get a tumble?
Wanna bet a quarter?
- That you can make him speak to you?
- Yeah! - All right.
A quarter.
- The bet's on.
- d Maybe I'll fall dd
- Hey. Do you have to do that?
- I'm singin'.
- I had an aunt once who used to make noises like that.
She called it ''neuraliga. "
Neuralgia must run in your family.
Well, listen, kid.
If you want to prove that something runs in your family, this is the spot.
You got a clear deck.
- I don't know whether I won or not.
I bet her a quarter she couldn't get you to talk to her.
- Which one of us wins? - Oh.
So you're a couple of them smart janes, huh?
But almost every fella we meet makes a pass at us.
When my girlfriend here said you wouldn't flirt, I just couldn't believe it.
I suppose you think when you pass by... guys just naturally drop dead.
- If you don't want them to flirt with you... what do you dress like that for?
You wear those clothes for what?
To show off the curves of your body.
Look at the waist.
What's that so low for?
Yeah. So some guy can get an eyeful.
And your dress is deliberately made for the wind to blow up over your knees.
Listen, sister.
If you don't want guys to salute ya, take down your flag.
You're like all other janes.
If a guy makes a pass at ya, you wanna call out the police.
And if he don't, you wanna call the army.
- You don't seem to like me.
- I think you're a pain in the neck.
Well, my name is Dorothy Haley.
You ain't kiddin' me a bit.
You're like all the other fellas.
You just have a new line.
That's all. - You'll be making a pass at us yet.
- We'd make a great team- with my- and your conceit.
- Oh, hello, Edna.
- Hello there,Jane.
How are you? - Hey. My sister's over here.
Come over, will ya?
- d Come on, baby d
- d You want to dd
Please, will ya?
My nerves.
Ain't there any other tune you can almost sing?
You ain't told me your name.
- I used to know a fella named Joe.
He drove a Ford.
Did you ever meet him?
Well, I might've, at that.
No. The guy I knew drove a Chevrolet, and his name was Fred.
No. It couldn't have been the same guy.
- Oh, you're quite a kidder.
- Yeah, you're pretty fresh yourself.
Just fresh enough.
Say, what makes you such a grouch?
Janes like you.
You work all day in some store... and then you rush home to sleep at night in some stuffy tenement.
And you'll be content to do it for the rest of your life... because you're just a good-time girl.
This is where you wanna be, with a lot of saps like that... yellin' their heads off and thinkin' they're enjoying themselves.
You ain't got brains enough to realize... that now is the time you oughta be saving your money... and trying to make something better of yourself.
- Well, you're here, ain't ya?
- I'm here to get fresh air.
But you notice I ain't spendin' any dough on you, don't ya?
Not even an ice cream soda.
Say, listen, you big stiff.
If you think I'm worried... about you buying me an ice cream soda, you're crazy.
I wouldn't be found dead with ya.
I had a swell time.
Well, do you want to see me again?
Oh, I should say not.
But accidents will happen.
I gotta go upstairs now.
You see, my mother's dead, and my brother's boss of the house.
He gets sore when I stay out late.
You know, he's careful for me.
But as Edna says, you can't watch a girl hard enough... to keep her good if she don't want to be.
Get 10 cents'worth of potato salad too.
Don't bring Llmburger.
I don't want the flat all smelled up again.
Oh, I know what to get.
Gee, I wish she wouldn't holler down the stairs that way.
It don't give the house no class.
My mother always used to holler down the stairs.
So's my old man.
He sold his coat for a drink and caught pneumonia.
He was a terrible lush.
My old lady was nice though.
- Hello, Dot.
- Hello, Paula.
Everything lives in this house.
Nobody'll speak to her anymore but me.
It makes my brother sore when I do.
But as Edna says, nobody knows whether a person's good or bad but the person themselves.
And they won't tell.
This Edna jane does most of your thinking, don't she?
Edna's swell.
She's got a kid almost seven.
Jerome 7... 4-7-5-3.
Her mother's been awful sick.
You better come over.
Now, Esther... you gotta control yourself.
9:15.
I had just looked at the clock.
You better stop in at Mr. Levant's.
Esther, you gotta get ahold of yourself.
There's things to be done.
Your mother, Mrs. Gardner?
- Oh, I'm so sorry for you.
Thanks, Miss Haley.
Still stays hot out, don't it?
Do you want me to go up with you, ma'am?
I'm just a little tired, I guess.
You know, a tenement house like this is awful funny.
Here her mother's dead on the fifth floor.
And only this morning... on the second floor...
Mrs. Mills had a new baby.
Well, she didn't do that kid no favor.
- I mean bringing it into the world... where she ain't got money enough to take care of it.
Oh,Joe, that's a terrible thing to say.
What's the kid got to look forward to?
Starvin' himself to death in some tenement.
Born on the second floor and... probably die on the fifth.
His whole life spent in climbin' three flights of stairs.
- Oh,Joe, you're terrible hard.
- Yeah? Well, here's one guy's gonna beat this game, see?
No poverty, no pinching', no scrimping' for me.
I got $580 saved up, see?
In a couple of months, I'm gonna have my own radio shop.
Gee, there are a lot of things in life besides just money.
Yeah. Sure there's a lot of things in life beside money.
But you gotta have money to find them.
Well... I gotta go now.
My brother will lay me out in lavender.
I went to Coney Island once and didn't get in till midnight.
Was he sore.
He hit me in the eye.
- Say, do you want me to go up with you?
- Oh, no. - That'd only make it worse.
Well, no guy's gonna hit any jane I go out with, brother or no brother.
Oh, he just wants to see that I keep straight.
- But as Edna says-
- Ah, who cares what Edna says?
Well... I gotta go now.
I told you not to bring any Llmburger cheese In here.
I won't have the flat all stunk up!
Well, It don't smell after It's eaten.
There's a tenement for ya.
A woman dies, a baby's born... and a guy's wife won't let him eat Limburger.
Gee, you're a funny fella,Joe.
In fact, you're the first guy I ever went out with that didn't try to get fresh.
Well, I gotta go now.
Say,Joe, you know, I like you an awful lot.
You'll probably be just nutty enough to call me up at the shop.
The number's Schuyler 4... 6-5-8-3.
Four, 65, 83.
That's the way I always remember numbers.
Walt a minute.
My name ain'tJoe.
It's Eddie Collins.
Oh, Eddie, uh, will you have this gentleman's set finished by tomorrow morning?
I'll work on it tonight.
You've got a great set.
- Mmm. Your wife will enjoy that.
- Oh, I haven't any wife.
- Oh. - That's why I'm able to pay $300 for a radio.
Well, there's something to that.
Of course, if you keep your radio turned on all the time... you have the effect of a wife anyway.
Ah, you hear?
That fella's got the right idea.
Eddie, now, you take a lesson from him.
Not a Chinaman's chance.
He's been getting a lot of telephone calls lately, Mr. Lathrop. - Ah.
- Well, I'd hate to see you making any mistake, Eddie.
Why, you can have your own little place in six months.
- But not if you let a woman get a hold on ya.
- Oh. I never even think about it.
That's the danger.
Do you suppose any man would ever marry if he thought of it?
Why, I can't even talk to a girl.
You know, it's funny about me that way.
I'd like to be nice to women.
You know, say nice things to them, like fellas can.
I can't though.
I think of nice things to say.
But when it comes to putting 'em into words- I only say something sarcastic and mean.
- But me get married?
- That's a laugh.
Hey, sheikh.
Hello, stupid.
Sure, it's me.
Yeah. The same place.
In front of Loft's candy store.
Listen, unconscious.
I ain't waiting' for any dizzy janes on a street corner, see?
Waiting for me, baby?
- I'm waiting for my husband.
He's the cop on this beat. - Excuse me.
- I was just going.
- Well, ain't that swell.
Say, you got a lot of nerve letting me stand out there in the pouring rain.
Gee, I didn't know it was so late.
I got to foolin' around with this thing.
Ain't it a pip?
It'll bring in anything from KGO to L20.
Sweet job, huh?
Come here, and I'll show you what I had to do with it.
What do I care what you had to do with it?
I'm not Marconi... or Edison or whoever invented the thing.
- I'm standing out there-
Radio's my job.
I'm gonna have my own store soon.
- I thought you were interested in my work.
- I am interested, Eddie.
But, gee, I got a right to be sore, standing out in the rain like that.
Well, after all, you can't saw sawdust.
What kind of a crack is that?
''You can't saw sawdust. "
I mean it's done.
All I can do is say that I'm sorry.
- Do you forgive me?
- Well, I got a right to be sore.
All right. You're sore.
What are you kicking about?
- Well, I got a right.
Aw, come on.
How'd you ever find the place?
I remember you said it was on the third floor in the front.
Come on. Take your coat off and stay a while.
Oh, no, Eddie.
Let's go to a movie, huh?
Ah, look. It's raining cats and dogs out.
- Well, I can't stay here.
- What's the matter with this?
My brother would rip me apart if he knew I was alone with a fella in his room.
Suppose your landlady found me.
Gee, she'd think I was a tramp or something.
Ah, they don't expect nothing raw here.
This ain't no $12-a-day hotel.
Ah, let's wait downstairs then.
It might rain for an hour yet.
Let's stay here where they have ashtrays and things.
Besides, it ain't right, my being alone here in the room with you.
- Did I ever get fresh with ya?
- No. But I ain't that kind of a girl.
I don't go to fellas' rooms.
Listen. I got other things to think about, see?
I'm gonna have my own store soon.
I was talking to the boss about it only today.
Oh, gee, Eddie.
That'll be swell.
None of that mushy stuff for me.
- Give us a kiss, will ya? - Oh.
None of that mushy stuff, huh?
Ah, well, a little of it's all right.
Take off your coat and stay a while.
- Oh, no.
I can't. Oh, no.
- Eddie, now-
- Come on.
Come on. - Take that hat off.
- Stay
- Oh, no. - Eddie, I'm not gonna take my hat off.
- Oh, now you're- - Take it off.
I didn't know it was as late as that.
- Ah, it's early yet.
Stopped raining.
Hey, lookit.
There's a fella trying to kiss a girl.
Oh, Eddie, please don't.
Aw, gee.
You can't be with me two minutes but you gotta pull that ''I gotta go" gag.
Aw, no. But you don't understand.
You'd think I was poison or something.
- Oh, no, but it's getting late, and I can't stay any longer.
- I know.
Aw, Eddie.
Don't get mad.
I'm not mad.
But you're always talking about ''I gotta go. "
Well, I do have to go.
It's only about 4:00.
Yeah, but I've never been out later than 12:00 in my life.
Oh, my brother will kill me.
Aw, gee, kid. Please don't do that.
If I could only find Edna.
Aw, can't you do anything without Edna's help?
My brother's stuck on her.
If she was there, he wouldn't be sore at me.
At least he wouldn't holler.
He's got a terrible temper.
Well, you want to go over and try Edna's house again?
If she was there, she'd open the door.
She must be sleeping at her aunt's.
I'm goin' up and tell your brother you were with me.
No. You can't go up.
There'd only be a fight.
Aw, there wouldn't be any fight.
He'd make one crack, I'd hang that in his jaw, and the fight would be all over.
I like you a terrible lot.
- Oh, don't just say... - ''Okay. "
- Aw, gee, kid.
I ain't much, and... well, you-you know... words don't seem to-
- Aw, what are you bawling for?
Aw, gee, kid.
Me staying out till 4:00 in the morning.
What'll I do?
I tell ya.
You can say we were gonna get married.
- Oh, he'd find out we weren't.
When we didn't.
Well, we would.
- We would?
- Would ya?
You mean you're- you're asking me to marry you?
Oh, sure I will, Eddie.
I'll love to marry you, Eddie.
You'll never be sorry or anything, honest you won't.
- But I never thought you meant we'd really get married.
- Oh, well, Eddie, if you want to back out, I won't-
- Oh. - So you want to make an argument out of it, huh?
I never back out ever, see?
And let me tell you something.
You ain't putting' nothin' over on me neither.
- I don't- - Not a thing.
If I didn't think... you were the swellest jane in the world, I never would have given you a tumble.
For me, nothing but the best, see?
So if you've got any idea in your nut that I'm the kind of guy... runs around asking any jane to marry him, you're crazy.
Oh, gee, Eddie, you're a scream.
Why, you can-you can even make a fight out of a proposal of marriage.
But you ain't kiddin' me.
You try to make out you're hard-boiled... but you're not really.
Why, you've got a heart as big as anything.
- And you're square too.
- Hooey. The kind of a fella a girl can depend on.
I was in love with you almost the first time we met.
Oh, you're fine and decent and tenderhearted.
You're just the sweetest guy in all the world.
- And we can be happy.
Lots of people are married and happy.
That'll never happen to us.
- I should say not.
- Do you want me to go up with you?
I'm not afraid now.
You know... it's sort of like not being alone anymore.
It is like that, ain't it?
When'll we be married?
In the morning.
Say... I'm kind of happy about it.
Well, what do you know about that?
Good night, kid.
- Eddie.
Hey, cab.
Hello, Edna.
Jim come over to my house about an hour ago to see if you were there.
He was worried about you, so I came back here with him.
- I couldn't remember the name of that hospital... you said you were going to to visit that girl.
She must be worse, huh? Your staying there until almost 4:00.
You mean well, Edna, but that's a lot of hooey.
- Where were ya?
- Where do you think, Edna?
- I'm gonna get married.
So, it's as bad as that, huh?
What do you mean it's as bad as that?
I thought girls brought their fellas around and showed them off first to their families.
Well, not that you'd have brains enough to know it... but I've been a pretty good brother to you, see? I've been a father and a mother to ya.
I'm supporting this house.
And you've got some nerve comin' in at 4:00 in the morning... tellin' me that you're gonna get married.
Why do you object?
You don't even know the fella.
No, but I'm going to.
Bring him around.
Let him meet your family, like any decent fella would want to do.
And after a while, if I think he's all right... you can marry him.
- After a while?
- Oh, that gets a rise out of you, does it?
I thought it would.
One of them rush marriages.
- You don't know that I did anything wrong.
- I can put two and two together.
- Oh,Jim, you're rotten.
- You can prove that you're not.
You tell me that you'll wait, or I'll know that you gotta marry this guy. And if that's the case, I don't want you in the house.
- Now, what do you think about that?
- Where'll I go? Go back where you come from, you little tramp.
And get out now.
You won't take any clothes with you either.
I paid for every rag you got on your back.
Go on. Get out.
You deserve everything you're gettin'.
Sure does.
A girl brought up under the influence of a fine brother like you got.
You'll probably end up in the streets.
That's what you got in your mind, ain't it,Jim?
And I won't be sorry for her either.
No, I don't expect you to be sorry for her,Jim.
But let her have her clothes.
- I paid for 'em.
- Yeah, but don't be cheap.
Let her find out there ain't another man who'll treat her as white as her own brother did.
Go on. Let her have her clothes.
Get 'em, and get out.
Hey.
- Where you goin'? - With the kid, you big bully.
You called her a tramp, didn't ya?
Just because she stayed out until 4:00 in the morning and you suspect where she was.
Well, I stayed out until 4:00 in the morning, and you knew where I was. So I got a pretty good idea what you think of me.
I'll see you in the cemetery.
Go on, Dot.
Wake up, Dotty.
Hello, Floyd.
Ma just hollered across the air shaft... and said that she was makin' breakfast for a new bride.
Are you a new bride?
I'm going to be today.
- What's an old one?
- Oh, you monkey, you.
Run along and play now.
Aw, I wanna see Dotty get out of bed.
I wanna see Dotty get out of bed.
And at his age.
- Almost 11:00.
- I phoned the store and said we were both sick.
- Has Eddie come yet?
- He hasn't? - Not yet.
- I wonder why he doesn't come.
- Maybe it's 'cause he doesn't know I'm here.
- That'd be a good reason.
He certainly wouldn't come to see me.
Oh, he doesn't really dislike you, Edna.
No, not dislike.
And it isn't just an average, everyday, amateur kind of hatred either.
I'll bet that guy spends hours practicing hating me.
Aw, that's just his way.
You know, he's kind of funny.
He'll hand you a lot of laughs.
Oh, gee, Edna, it was swell the way you came through for me last night.
- I'm awful grateful to ya.
- And I'm grateful toJim.
- He saved my life.
- How? Just suppose he didn't turn out to be a heel last night.
He saved my life- 'cause they send you to the chair these days for killing your husband.
In the name of goodness, what are you doing?
- I'm trying something, but it won't work. - What won't?
I put some black ink in the white milk... and the white milk turned black.
But when I put the white milk in the black ink, the black won't turn white.
Put that ink away and clean up that mess.
- Oh, Edna, what time Is It now?
It's a little after 11:00.
- Where'd you put my stockings?
- Why, I put 'em, uh-
Is this Mrs. Cook's boardinghouse?
Well, is Mr. Collins there?
Eddie Collins.
He moved away?
Well-Well, he lived there last night.
He moved away this morning?
Well- Well, did he say where he was moving to?
- He's walked out on me.
- Don't be a goof.
Oh. I wish I was dead.
We all get that wish someday.
Call up his store.
Do you know the number?
Schuyler 4-6583.
And hurry it up, deary.
Hello, Lathrop Radio Shop?
Well, can I speak to Mr. Collins, please?
Never mind the wisecracks.
He's there, I wanna speak to him.
This is the girl he's engaged to be married to.
Fresh guy trying to flirt with me.
He was fired?
He said he was fired for robbin' the cash register.
Well, you're all right then.
If he's lost his job, it's a cinch he'll be here to marry ya.
I can't tell whether the fella was kiddin' or not.
There he is now. See?
All of your troubles for nothing.
Oh, gee, and I'm not dressed or anything.
Oh, give me those stockings.
I don't wanna subscribe to any magazines.
I don't care if you're working your way through the penitentiary.
- Was that him, Edna?
- No. A book agent.
Now, stop worrying.
If Eddie is only half the guy I think he is, he won't let you down.
That's the trouble with us women.
If we'd only realize that-
Oh, what are you doing now?
- I'm cookin' it for ya.
- A whole pound of butter.
I told you a piece of butter, not a pound of butter.
A pound's a piece.
I'll go, Edna.
Oh, darling, you're driving me crazy.
Get out into the hall. You've done all the damage in here that you can.
See if you can ruin the wallpaper.
- Shall I do it with a knife?
- Get out of here!
- Wasn't him, huh?
A man selling-
For goodness' sake, take that long face off.
This is your wedding day, not your funeral.
There's a mistake somewhere. That's all.
Yeah, last night- that was the mistake.
Oh, but I love him so much.
Well, you can still love him and have a cup of coffee in your stomach too.
I never want to eat anything again.
- Fine. Then have a glass of milk.
- I don't want any milk.
Oh, come on.
Have a glass of milk. It'll do you good.
You know, the first thing that you have to learn is-
I'm getting hysterical.
Open the door, Floyd.
And if it's a man selling coffins, tell him we'll take two.
- Nothing.
Say, listen. You're going to be a married man.
The first thing you have to learn is to get accustomed to your wife's tears.
I was over to your house, and they said you wasn't there. So I took a chance and come here.
I called up your house, and your landlady said that you'd moved.
I got a bigger room across the street.
My landlady was sore.
That's why she wouldn't tell you where I went.
And they said at the store that you'd been bounced for stealing.
They were kidding' ya.
Oh, Eddie, I'm so happy.
- Okay. - Now maybe you can eat some breakfast.
We'll eat downtown.
- Do you know how to get there?
- I'll tell ya. You take the subway to City Hall.
- Yeah? When you get out of the train, you walk straight ahead and turn to the right.
There are two exits there.
You take the one to the left. Understand?
- Yeah.
- Then when you get up on the street...
- you walk straight ahead- - I'm gonna take a cab.
I'll tell you which cab to take.
Hey. Whose wedding is this, yours or mine?
Oh, Edna's just trying to help us, Eddie.
You wasn't on the other side when they had the war, were ya?
- No. What's the answer?
- I was wondering how they ever got along without you.
I phoned my orders over.
Won't you come down and see us get married?
I hate those things- deaths and funerals and things like that.
Oh, gee, Edna. I can never thank you enough for all you've done for me.
Oh, that's all right, kid.
I only hope you're gonna be awful happy.
If she ain't, you'll hear from me, you big stiff.
- Hello, darling.
- What's this? - Oh.
Just a couple of hunks of candy.
Because you love me, don't ya?
Ah- - Oh, say it.
Say ''I love you, darling. "
Right out in all the light?
- Oh, Eddie.
- This is our anniversary.
Ten weeks ago today we got hitched.
Aw, gee, it was sweet of you to bring me the candy.
And I got news for ya.
I found a store.
The boss is gonna lend me a hundred bucks... and with the 650 I got saved up, I can swing the deal.
He'll let me have all the radios I want on time.
- What do you know about that, huh?
- That'll be swell.
Of course, we may have to pinch nickels for a while but... in the end, it'll all be jake.
- Gee whiz, I'm a happy guy.
- Are you, Eddie?
Yeah. I been thinkin' about having my own store for over two years now.
And while I ain't much on tossing' this baloney... and all that mush stuff... a guy could have a worse wife than you.
- Ya little squirt.
- I love you so, darling.
- Okay. Hey.
Put your hat and coat on, and I'll take you over and show you the place.
- Oh, I can't now.
- Why not?
I'm waitin' for Edna. She phoned she'll be up in a little while.
- Ah, what does she want?
- Well, I wanted to ask her advice about something.
- About-
Well, about the store, see what she thinks of it.
It'll be tough if she don't like it.
Oh, Eddie, that's not a nice thing to say.
Here she is. Now, please don't be mean to her.
- HI, Edna.
How's the grouch?
I thought they sent you down to Washington... so you could tell the president how to run the country. Ooh.
They sent the president up to see me.
Oh, don't mind him, Edna.
- He's happy as the devil today.
- Yeah, he looks it.
- He's gonna open his own store soon.
- Hmm! I heard Wanamaker's were going out of business.
They probably figured the competition would be too much for 'em.
I'm going down to the corner and get a paper.
Come on. Sit down.
- Still in love with him?
- Oh, I'm just crazy about him.
Edna, I'm going to have a baby.
- Oh, don't be silly.
- My mother had eight of'em.
- Yeah. My mother died having me.
Yes, but things are different now.
You know, the hospitals are better, and the doctors and things.
No girl minds it anymore.
- What does Eddie say?
Well, why don't you tell him?
Well, his heart's so set on having that store.
It'll take every nickel he's got.
Oh, I don't know what to do.
Edna, I'm so worried.
You know, if the store's gonna make Eddie happy, I want him to have it.
- When I think of what happened to my mother-
Unless I had everything of the best- you know, the best doctors and everything- - I'd be frightened.
- You poor kid.
Now listen.
This fella you're married to is all right.
He's 100°/o.
I know what's the matter with him.
He's one of those sensitive eggs.
Of course, he may not like me, but what the heck.
Napoléon had a couple of enemies too.
Now you tell Eddie tonight.
And if I know anything about men... he'll be stopping strangers on the street tomorrow, bragging about it.
- Oh, sure.
All men are alike.
They puff themselves up.
You'd think they'd done something. - Oh, I hope he'll really be like that.
I don't know though.
He's always yelling about living in a tenement... and what a sin it is to have children if you can't afford to give 'em everything.
I don't think I read anything in the papers about him being born in the White House.
He was awful poor.
That's why he thinks like that about it.
- You still here?
Dld you get your paper, Eddle?
I got down there, and I didn't have any change.
You can get one next week. They'll have a dozen new murders for you by then.
Here, let me fix that tie.
- It looks like a unbent pretzel.
- The tie is- You only wear it.
Other people have to look at it.
I don't know how you ever picked this jane out for a friend.
- She's the dizziest dame I ever seen.
Look what I got, Eddie.
- Where'd you get all this stuff?
- Eddie give us 60 cents to buy it.
Aw, he's crazy.
- Sixty- Oh, what did you wanna come up here for anyway?
Go on outside and play.
Thanks a lot, Eddie!
Gimme a slice of that cone down there.
I found 'em downstairs in that dark hallway tryin' to play games.
They ain't got a chance in life.
Eddie, did you give him the 60 cents?
Listen, I got better things to do with my money... than throw it away on a lot of kids.
Say, you're a swell egg.
What are you gonna sell in your radio store?
Never mind.
The way you run people's business for them... if you start butting' in, I'll probably end up owning' a butcher shop.
- Remember now.
- Tell him what?
Oh, nothing, Eddie.
She's got a secret for ya.
Oh, she's got a secret for me, but you know it.
Geez, you're runnin' my house for me, too, I see.
Bye, darlin'.
- Bye, grouch.
- So long, dizzy.
- What's the big secret?
- I don't know whether you'll like it or not.
Hey, listen, kid. I'm so happy about the store, I'd like anything.
Eddie, I'm going back to work.
- Back to work?
- Yeah. Hey, listen.
No wife of mine is goin' to work.
- What'd be the harm?
- I'll do all the work that's to be done in this family.
- What do you wanna go to work for?
Well, it gets kind of lonesome staying' here all day all alone.
Can't you go to picture shows and things?
You just said we'd have to pinch nickels.
Yeah, but I didn't mean we'd have to pinch 'em that hard.
- You don't like livin' in just one room. Is that it?
- Oh, it's all right.
But I wish we had a flat of our own or something-you know, our own furniture.
Can't you see, Eddie?
If I went to work, you could have your store just the same.
And with the money I make, we could-
Do you think I'd take money you worked for?
- Oh, it'd be all right.
- Not with me, it wouldn't.
My idea of a husband is a guy that looks after his wife and takes care of her... and sees that she don't want for nothin'.
If I can't do that, I won't be a husband.
Me take your money- you work all day- or let you use it for something that I ought to be payin' for.
They got a name for guys like that.
Oh, Eddie, I didn't mean to make you sore.
I ain't sore.
But I ain't as happy as I was. You can lay that on a line.
It was our 10 weeks anniversary.
And I had the store all picked out and everything.
And, say, when I come in here tonight, I was walkin' on air.
This kinda crumbs it all up.
Gee, I didn't know you wasn't satisfied.
Oh, Eddie, I am satisfied.
- I'll bet that Edna jane put that idea in your nut.
- No, she didn't.
Let's not say any more about it.
You're crazy to have the store, and it'll make you happy.
Well, that's all I care about- making you happy.
I'm the husband, and it's my job to make you happy.
If a husband ain't for that, he ain't for nothin'.
Gee, I told the real estate guy I'd meet him tonight.
I can't make up my mind about that sign.
''Eddie Collins" or ''Edward Collins"?
Course, ''Eddie Collins" is all right for a saloon or somethin' like that.
Nope, it ain't got class enough for a radio store.
I'll be back in 15 or 20 minutes.
And I still think that Edna jane put that idea in your nut.
I was afraid you wasn't comin'.
What's the idea of phoning' me to meet you here?
- Dot and me are movin' here.
- You're movin' here?
I got new furniture and everything.
That's why I asked you to come.
I thought maybe you'd help me put 'em in the right places.
You'd be butting' in anyway, so I figured out you might as well do it in the beginning.
You're moving here?
Yeah. Dot told me that secret.
What's that got to do with your moving and spending your money?
She wanted to go to work.
- You mean that's the secret she told you?
- Yeah. So I put two and two together and figured out why.
She wanted a home with nice furnishings and things.
- Say, how much did all this cost you?
- I shot the bankroll.
- All you'd saved?
This is a swell joint.
The furniture man is takin' charge.
I bought everything new- from soup to nuts.
When it's finished, it'll look just like a home that somebody's lived in for a long time.
Some surprise for the kid, huh?
Yeah, but what about your store?
Well, I figured, why let her starve to death... while I'm tryin' to build up a business?
I might've made a flop of the store anyhow.
Not that I would've.
I'd have made a success of it.
Don't get that idea in your nut.
And you spent all your savings?
Sure. She's worth it.
She's a great kid.
You'll have me crying in a minute, Eddie.
You wouldn't know.
You never saw anything sweller than that parlor set I bought. Come on.
Wait till you get a load of the bedroom.
It's got sheets and pillowcases and beds and everything in it.
And the kitchen- We got a lot of pots and pans.
It's gonna be like a party.
See, I'm gonna tell Dot that Pat and Sue have got a new flat... and are havin' a housewarming and we're invited.
I asked a lot of the gang, and they're in on it too.
It's gonna be like, you know, one of those surprise parties.
And the big payoff comes when I say... ''Well, kid, how do you like your new home?"
What do you think of the idea?
- You didn't think it up. That's why.
Don't put that great big chair over there by the divan.
- That's where the chair belongs.
It belongs over on this side.
Haven't you got any sense of balance?
- You would get your mouth in it some way or another.
dd Hey, hey. Wait until they get here.
Aw, have a heart.
I haven't had any supper.
And don't drink up all the punch.
Listen, Pat.
Remember, this is supposed to be your home.
You're the host.
- Right. I'll take off my coat and collar.
- That ain't funny.
- It always gets a laugh.
- You open the door.
Go on. I didn't even know that Pat had moved from 92nd Street.
They got a swell place here.
- Hello, Dot.
How are you? - Hello, Sue.
- Hello, Eddie.
- I didn't know that you'd moved.
Oh, I've been here a week. Come in.
Hi, everybody.
- Hello, Chad. How are you?
- Hello, Pat.
How are you? - Let me take your coat.
- Have a schnapps.
Oh, gee, Sue, this is swell.
Pat must have murdered a millionaire or something.
Hey, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Come on out here and I'll show you the kitchen.
You'd think this was his house.
Let's eat. A closet, and it's got glass in it too.
And a sink and a washtub.
And look at these things over here- canisters.
That's where you keep your salt and pepper and spices and things.
In the one marked ''Salt," you keep the salt. In the one marked ''Pepper," you keep the pepper.
Gee, Eddie, ain't it swell?
Look at that darling table.
The guy said it was the breakfast nook.
Oh, Eddie, you think we'll ever have a place like this?
- Would you like to live here, kid?
- Oh, gee, would I? - Of course, we couldn't afford-
Well, we couldn't afford the money now.
Well, why now?
- Well, you wanna get your store first.
Say, wait till you get a load of the bedroom.
Say, if Eddie can get Dot a home like this, why can't you get me one?
I thought that'd crop up.
- Oh, this is swell.
Listen, kid.
There's a bed.
You can't buy a better bed than that- 65 bucks.
- But how did you-
- Oh, Pat told me.
Come on.
Just feel it. Ain't this a bed?
Not like that old egg crate we sleep in.
I've never seen you so enthusiastic.
The house has sure made a hit with you.
Now I'm gonna show you somethin'.
Just grand.
There's the bridges over there. And there's all New York to pick from.
Ain't the lights great?
And the East River.
And stars.
Aren't they beautiful?
Not phony ones either.
Gee, a roof like this would be a swell place for... kids to play.
Wouldn't it, Eddie?
You know, they could get plenty of fresh air... and their mothers wouldn't have to worry about streetcars... and taxis and trucks and things.
You know, rich kids couldn't have a better place than this.
You like it, don't you, kid?
Oh, I think it's just grand.
I'm awful glad for Pat and Sue.
Okay. We better get back to the bunch now.
You said it. Sue, it's the grandest flat I ever saw.
- I'm awfully glad you like it, Dot.
- Oh, it's sweet for anything.
Dot, sit down.
Well, kid, it's yours.
What do you mean, mine?
- Sure. Yours.
This is where you're gonna live.
- You bought it for me?
You know that secret about goin' back to work?
Well, I doped it out that you wasn't satisfied where you're livin'.
So this is the answer.
- Well, what about your store?
- Thls Is It.
You spent all your money for this?
I shot the works.
- You mean, all of your money?
- We don't owe a nickel on It.
Well, what do ya say?
Don't seem to make such a hit with ya now.
Naturally, Eddie.
She's surprised.
You can't get a thing like this through your head in a minute.
- Did you know he was doing it, Edna?
- Yeah, I helped him fiÿx It up.
Why'd you let him spend all the money?
Well, folks, it looks like a bust.
Oh, no, it isn't, Eddie.
I think it's just great.
I'm tickled to death.
- You're the swellest husband any girl ever had.
Dot's only disappointed for you, Eddie.
She was so anxious for you to have the store... she didn't want you to spend the money for anything else.
That's why, dear.
You know I think it's just swell.
Why'd ya do it?
Well, I figure, a long time dead.
Live while ya can.
When I think of the way my folks used to live.
They didn't have enough money to support themselves... so they go and have nine kids.
My old lady used to scrub floors in an office building.
4:00 every morning she went to work- sick or well, summer or winter.
I can see her goin'out when It was 20 below zero... with a cough that'd tear the heart out of ya.
To bring up a couple ofklds and die- dle before they was ever any comfort to her.
Not for Dot.
Every nickel I make, she and I are gonna spend on ourselves.
- My sister died bringing up-
- Oh, stop it!
Can't you stop it!
You'd think there was nothin' else in the world to talk about.
All right.
Dot's going to have a baby.
There's nothing to worry about, Eddle.
No, she's just a little hysterical.
That's all. We shouldn't have talked about those things.
- That's right.
I guess we shouldn't. - Sue told me, but I forgot.
Gee, everybody in New York seems to know about it... but the only guy that's interested.
Oh, gee, Eddie, I wish you'd let me do that.
Don't be crazy, will ya?
You're goin' to the hospital in a few weeks.
You know the doc told you not to do any hard work.
I don't think he knows what he's talkin' about.
I don't like him. - You want me to get you a different one?
If you can't get the best, he's as good as any of the others, I guess.
He's all right.
I worry. That's all.
You having to do this before you go to work in the morning... and pinching' every nickel the way you have.
I don't want a baby any more than you do.
Now you told me that a thousand times.
Is there any other doctor you got in mind?
There was somethin' in the paper about a society woman.
The doctor's name was Burgess.
His picture was there.
Gee, he was awful kind-lookin'.
Not that we could get him.
He's only for millionaires.
As long as you can't get him, you might as well pick out the best.
Whoo-ooh! Dot!
Now don't bring her in here.
I don't want her razzin' me.
- Hello, Edna.
- Hello, Eddie.
Floyd made such a racket, I didn't wait for breakfast.
- Got a cup of coffee?
Hmm. You got a new washerwoman, I see.
I figured you'd make that crack.
You haven't got enough bluing in this water.
I knew somethin' would be wrong with it when you seen it.
No, I cut 'em out.
They was puttin' my throat on the bum.
Come on, Edna. Drink this in the other room.
Beat it, will ya?
You give me the willies.
- Oh, all right.
- How do you feel when you feel bad?
- I worry.
Yeah, and you worry other people too.
You worry him.
Your child'll probably grow up to be a radio broadcaster.
Gee, It's 10 minutes to 8.ÿ00. I gotta blow.
Don't touch those things.
I'll finish 'em when I come home.
- So long, meddlesome.
- Good-bye, grouch.
Break a leg.
- Swell guy.
- That's what makes me so miserable. - What?
- He's so square about everything.
Says smoking hurts his throat.
He cut it out so he could save the money.
It doesn't seem fair that he should give up all his fun just because of me.
Yeah, it's tough on husbands.
Nobody knows what a husband suffers when his wife has a baby... and a big juicy raspberry.
You want it, don't you, Dot?
I'm crazy about it. That is, I would be... if it weren't for Eddie and if I wasn't afraid.
- How do you know he doesn't want it?
- The things he says.
I can feel it, too, in the way he acts.
He doesn't like children.
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. - Say, how old is it?
- Only seven months.
Of course, all parents are proud of their children.
But honestly, even if this was somebody else's kid... I'd have to admit it's the cleverest youngster I ever saw.
- Don't you think so, Mama?
- I honestly do.
The little son of a gun's got ahold of my finger.
- She's a darling.
- Coochie-coo.
Coochie-coo.
Coochie, coochie-coo.
Eddie. - Has Mr. Randall's set been fixed for him?
- Gee, that's a great kid you got.
- We think so.
- Say, Mr. Lathrop?
Do you think that a woman havin' a baby... you know, that she hasn't always wanted... could-could learn to love it... you know, as if she'd always wanted it?
Oh. Your wife, eh?
Say, there ain't any danger in these things, is there?
Well, lots of women manage to have babies... without calling out the militia.
There's no danger when they have the proper attention.
She should be made to have confidence in her doctor.
My wife ain't got any.
- She speaks of a Dr. Burgess.
- Burgess? You'd have to be a millionaire to have him.
- Goin' to lunch, Eddie?
- Nah, I cut lunches out. I was gettin' too fat.
- This Dr. Burgess is good, huh?
- And expensive.
When a king is born, they send for him.
I wonder how you could get in to see a guy like that.
- Mr. Lathrop, will you take a look at this set, please?
Hey,Joe.
- Is your brother still matchmaker over at the Empire Club?
- Yeah. Do you suppose he could get me on in one of them preliminary fights?
Say, some of those boys are pretty good.
- What do you wanna take a beatin' for?
- Ten bucks a round.
Four rounds- 40 bucks.
I can use that dough swell.
- I can fix it for ya, but I think you're nutty.
7:00. Say, ain't that job of yours got any hours?
A guy wanted his radio fixed, so I did it on the side.
I should think you'd try gettin' home... with your wife goin' to the hospital and everything.
- She's worrying herself sick. That's how she is.
But, gee, she oughtn't to do that.
I don't think she knows that.
You ought to tell her.
- You had any supper?
Gettin' your beauty sleep, kid?
Gee, Eddie, I don't think it would hurt you to hang around once in a while.
That ''okay" does me a lot of good, don't it?
Gee, kid, you know I'm for you, don't ya?
Well, it don't look like it.
You haven't spent an evening in the house for two weeks now.
I don't mean to be a grouch, Eddie, but... I'm frightened. Is it the doctor?
Is that what makes you afraid?
Oh, he's all right, I guess.
You know, you have confidence in some people, and others you haven't.
There's no reason.
You just have. That's all.
Sure, I know how it is, kid.
Eddie, you're gonna stick around and go to the hospital with me tonight, ain't ya?
You betcha.
- I tell ya, I gotta go out-
Just for a half an hour, kid.
- Can't even stay with me tonight.
Honest I will.
Mmm. Your honey is searching among the ''bees. "
Yeah, this is his secretary.
Mm-hmm. Who wants to talk to him?
Joe? - There's a Joe wants to talk to you.
- Hello,Joe.
Sure I'll be there.
Hey, that's great.
It comes just at the right time.
Thanks. So long.
I'll be a little longer now, but I'll be back at 9:00.
I got another fella to see now.
- You pick a swell night to make a date.
- You sure do.
This ain't a date.
Honest it ain't.
- I'll be back as quick as I can.
- Give my love toJenny, will ya?
- WhatJenny?
- WhateverJenny happens to be there.
And-And tonight I'm takin' her to the hospital.
But I'm sure the doctor you have is competent.
You see, she's just a kid herself, and she's frightened.
Her mother died that way.
She read about you In the paper, Dr. Burgess. Well, of course, we never thought we could get ya.
She was sayin'that It would be swell... If she could get a guy like you to be with her.
Did you tell her you were coming to see me?
She and me ain't been gettin' along very well lately.
I've been workin' nights. I didn't tell her about it.
She thinks I've been chiseling' on her, I guess.
I can't tell things like that.
I'm kind of a mug that way.
Of course, I couldn't pay you what you're worth. But I tell ya.
I make 45 bucks a week, and pick up 15 workin' nights.
And I'm gettin' 40 bucks in a fight tonight.
And I got 381 saved up, see?
- Are you a prizefighter?
- No, slr.
But a friend of mine's gettin' me on... in the preliminaries over at the Empire Club.
I get 10 bucks a round, and I don't mind takin' a beating for 40 bucks.
Llsten, Dr. Burgess-
I always been kinda proud, see?
You know, pay my own way, take nothin' from nobody.
But I ain't that way now, Doc.
If she knew she was gonna have you with her... everything would be all right.
But as it is... she's so sick from worry- I'm afraid maybe she'll die.
Will you do it, Doc?
I'll give you the $381 I got saved up... and I'll pay you back dollar for dollar.
Please do it, will ya, Doc?
So help me, God, I'll- I'll lay down my life for ya.
I'll take the case.
- I guess I'm kinda nervous about this child thing.
Kinda goofy, huh?
Gee, Doc, I'm sorry I haven't got a cigar or somethin' to offer ya.
I cut out smokin'.
It was hurtin' my throat.
This is a swell dump you got here.
Oh, I didn't mean-
- He said 9:00.
You'd think the least he could do would be to be with me tonight.
Now, now, now. Don't get yourself all worked up.
Hey, Mike, knock that fella out, will ya?
This ain't a slaughterhouse.
I wanted to give him a break, but I'll put him away right at the next gong.
Aw, why don't ya quit?
I wouldn't take a beatin' like that for a hundred bucks.
Well, that's the difference between you and me.
One, two, three, four... five, six... seven, eight, nine-
Don't knock me out, will ya, buddy?
- My wife's gonna have a kid.
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
I guess I can't make it though.
Break it up.
I've arranged for the hospital.
The cab will be here at 11:00.
I never thought Eddie would do this to me.
But, darling, he's only an hour late.
Some hours are lifetimes.
He's walked out on me.
- When's the kid expected?
- Any-Anytime now.
- I got two of them. - Yeah?
How long before they get to know ya?
Mine knew me inside of two months.
- But of course, mine was kinda extra bright.
Oh, gee, kid, I'm sorry to be late.
- It's too bad about you.
- I couldn't help it.
Couldn't spend a couple of minutes with me, tonight of all nights?
You know how nervous I am.
But you could go to some speakeasy with a bunch of fellas... and get your face all battered up in a drunken brawl.
Is that what ya think?
That's what it looks like to me.
Do you want me to go with ya?
You don't have to bother about me anymore at all, Eddie.
I got Burgess for ya!
- How about it, Doctor?
- Congratulations.
Twins. - Twins?
- Boys or girls?
- Twins!
The baby business is picking up.
Sometimes I was here, and I was the only one.
- This your first?
- Yes, and my last.
I wouldn't go through this again for all the money in the world.
How many kids have you got?
Maybe eight.
I know I got six.
What's happening upstairs, I can't tell ya.
You're the father of a fine baby girl, Mr. Vernon.
- Oh, well. - Oh!
- Put him over here on the-
- It was too much for him.
- He'll be all right.
- I've got some smelling salts.
- That's fine. Give him some.
- He's as white as a sheet.
He'll be all right in a minute.
People kid about fathers, but they don't realize... what a guy has to go through when his wife has a baby.
If he had as many as I got, he'd stay unconscious.
He's coming to now.
- You just had a baby.
- Hold on, or he'll faint again.
- It's all right, Mr. Vernon.
- Hold him up.
- Gee, I'm gettin' nervous myself now.
Say, Mr. Linsky, I wanna ask you a question.
My wife wasn't any too anxious to- to have this kid.
Say, in two weeks, she will be crazy about it.
- Is that straight?
- They always are. Be careful.
Don't let her think that you are more concerned for the baby... than what you are for her.
Women get jealous under those conditions.
You know, be interested, but not anxious.
After all, you've known your wife for years... and the baby is practically a stranger.
Yeah, that's right.
Excuse me. I gotta phone my partner.
Your wife will see you in just a few minutes now.
Hey, what do you know about that?
My kid's 22 hours old already.
They get old very quickly when they're young.
- Hello, Doctor.
How are they?
- Fine. Say, Doc, I've got 350 bucks here.
- And I'll give ya-
- Yeah, well, I have your bill here.
Now, I have another patient.
I must hurry. - Good luck to you, my lad.
Gee, he'll never let me speak to him about money.
It says paid in full.
And here's a check.
''Pay to the order of Mr. Edward Collins's son- $50."
He's giving your boy $50 to start a bank account.
And he wouldn't let me give him anything.
That's a guy for ya, ain't it?
Oh, they're just grand, Mrs. Linsky.
Every time I have a baby, my husband gives me a new bracelet.
If I don't stop, I wouldn't have any more room.
- What do you think of it?
- Oh. Oh, no, this isn't yours.
This baby's six days old.
She acts like she hates the child.
I guess maybe she didn't want it.
Do parents hate children they don't want?
I heard of people like that.
How do you like this one?
- Oh, it's darling.
- Oh, no. This is young Mussolini.
Gee, it's funny when you think of it, ain't it?
Everybody in the world was once just a little bundle like that.
- Isn't this one cute?
- Oh, it's lovely.
Just look at those little hands.
Did you ever see such an adorable nose?
Gee, it's swell.
Don't you want to hold your baby?
- Honest?
Oh. - Thls Is It.
I wouldn't cry over It, Mrs. Colllns.
It's not the first time that a baby was born.
Well, it's the first time this baby was ever born.
Hello, kid.
Thanks for sending me the flowers.
- Yes, that's it, and it's no ''it. "
Well, I didn't mean it that way.
- That suits me too, kid.
- I thought it would.
We'll take him back to the nursery now.
I asked Dr. Burgess how we happened to get a fine doctor like him.
He just laughed and said that you'd tell me.
Oh, my boss knew him.
He did it for him.
- He give me a check for the baby's bank too.
- Wasn't that swell of him?
Those big guys do a lot of work for charity.
So you think of your baby as charity, do you?
- Gee, everything I say seems to be wrong.
I'd give anything if- well, if things were different.
Aw, everything's gonna be all right, kid.
We ain't gonna stop living just because we got a baby.
You and me is gonna have a good time, the same as always.
Why, In six months we'll have forgotten we got a kid.
Please go now.
- When'll you be home?
- In about two weeks.
Well, hurry it up.
I'll feel like stepping' out a bit.
- So long, kid.
- So long.
I'll be back every day.
Oh, Mrs. Linsky, she's getting bigger every day.
What are you going to call her?
I'm calling her Shelly, after my mother-in-law.
Her name was Esther, but it's close enough.
Well, how are all the mothers today?
- Is the cab downstairs?
- Yes. Are you ready?
Mm-hmm. - Are you leaving now?
But I heard you tell your husband that you were going tomorrow.
- I want to surprise him. - Oh.
Say, listen, kid.
- Have you thought this thing over?
I couldn't live with a man that didn't like his own child.
All he thinks about is stepping out.
I couldn't go back to Eddie for anything.
I'd get to hate him.
Well, it's your funeral, kid.
Well, what are you going to do with that?
Well, I thought maybe the kid would like to fool around with it.
A two-weeks-old baby?
Well, it's only a little balloon.
The doctor's in the ward.
You'll have to wait a few minutes.
- Dr. Gibson?
- Hurry, Nurse Parson.
- Hurry, Doctor.
- The nursery.
Something's happened to my baby!
Somethlng's happening to my baby.
No, Mrs. Collins.
- I want my baby!
I want my baby!
- He's all right.
- I want my baby!
- Please listen.
- I want my baby! - What's the matter, kid?
- Something's happened to my baby.
Your husband will get it.
Now, everything is all right.
- It's all right. - He's all right, kid.
- It was Mrs. Burns's baby.
Just a little coughing spell.
Oh, gee, kid.
I didn't know you liked it.
And I thought all along that you didn't like him.
That's a bright idea to get in your nut.
The things you said that night in the flat- you know, about your mother and everything.
Well, I thought like that then.
But gee, it's different when you got your own kid.
The little son of a gun's got ahold of my finger.
- Dr. Burgess said he had a finely shaped head.
- He did? Hey, look out there, buddy.
You might have the future president of the United States in this cab.
Now don't, Eddie.
Let me hold him, will ya?
- You really want to, Eddie?
- Sure. Be careful.
Put your arm under his head.
- There you go, baby.
Say, Dr. Burgess was right about the kid's head.
That's the best-shaped kid's head I ever saw.
He has a lovely head, hasn't he?
Oh, Eddie, give me the baby.
He's dribbling all over you.
Dribbling?
That ain't the half of it.
I'm wet clean through.
But it's okay.
dddd
Secure the rope well, Dimai.
Yes, I've got it.
I've got it.
- Hold on tight!
- l've got it!
Hey, come on, Count.
It's not very far.
With my guide and friend Dimai climbed Fanesturm... over the southeastern rim.
August 1, 1914
Artur Franchini, Rome
Here, a piece of bread, a piece of sausage, Count.
Thank you, Dimai.
- Let's go look!
To my peoples.
But the council of providence determined otherwise.
FRANZ JOSEPH TO MY PEOPLES!
The activities of a hate-filled enemy after many years of peace to preserve the honor of my monarchy... to safeguard its reputation and its power, and to protect its domain.
Florian Dimai - 4th Tirolean Imperial Infantry Regiment, 2nd Company
- Resi.
Watch the baby.
I'll be right back.
Our beautiful house, I won't see it for a long time.
And say hello to your mother, won't you?
In God's name, do come back safe and sound.
Take care, Wastl.
Florian, I'm so afraid for you.
Come on, Xaver!
Look at all the people who are here today.
The Grödners are here, Rixner is here and Machelt too.
- l'll be back soon.
God be with you.
Let's go, men!
God be with you!
- God be with you!
- God be with you, Franzl!
- l'll be back soon, Pia.
GALlClA 1915
"...and we are doing well.
But we miss you and the others."
Ha, that's us.
"And we had no parish fair... because there are no men.
Father said that at Christmas we could- ...that at Christmas we could get married."
"...we could get married.
So do you best, dear Albert, so that you can come home... and make the war end soon."
Have you heard the latest news?
Italy has entered the war.
Now we'll win.
They declared war on us.
On us!
What will happen to our village?
Mayor, Italian troops have seized Col Verde.
Everybody must follow my orders.
Tell your people to maintain calm and order and no one will get hurt.
Behind that mountain range.
That's where our home is.
We would be able to see it from up there.
It's been over a year since we had to leave our home.
No, soon it's going to be almost two years.
Do you think our people know we're up here?
They think we're still in Galicia.
I wonder how they're doing with the Italians down there.
To hell with it!
I'm going down there.
- Connect me with section command.
I almost sprained my ankle.
This is the summit of Col Alto.
This is section command Travalante.
Captain, a telephone call for you, sir.
- Captain Lehner.
- Lieutenant Kall.
The enemy is shooting at us with heavy artillery fire.
We had to interrupt our emplacement work and the men retreated into the cavern.
No significant losses.
The emplacement against the south slope is as good as completed.
The enemy can't possibly ascend the north and east face.
Even under the heaviest fire, the rock cavern is shellproof.
You don't need to worry, sir.
Well, you know how important your position is for the entire section.
Under no circumstances may your position be lost.
Our position will be held at all costs, sir.
The emplacement at Col Alto must be taken at all costs-
You know its importance to us.
Because it could undermine all of the enemy's emplacements.
Who will carry out the mission?
Captain Franchini.
He knows every rock and every path in the Col Alto.
Two boys once loved the same girl
And each one begged her Let me into your chamber
Only a soldier, the girl said Can be my beloved
Because only he has the courage in all things
Only a soldier will do
So the two boys ran to the barracks
And when the two came home
Alarm!
- Alarm! - Alarm!
This is Kall.
We repulsed a surprise attack by the Italians.
Just now, a moment ago.
Our losses are not heavy.
Very heavy on the Italian side, it seems.
Yes, it's quiet again now.
The men are retrieving the wounded.
Well, I hope that we'll have a few quiet days up here now.
- What lousy weather.
Lieutenant, I'm the mail orderly, sir.
Where is the carrier convoy?
They should be here by now.
I passed them on my way here.
They will need a few hours... because they are making very little progress in the deep snow.
Horn!
Ober-
- What's his name?
- Oberbauer.
Oberbauer, yes.
- You can't be serious!
Kall, Kall.
Nobody knows about us.
This stupid, goddamn war.
Am I not right?
We've been sitting here for over a year without news from home.
Everybody gets letters, except for us.
Funny it's us, who can almost see our homes from here.
It's hard to take for such a long time. It's hard to take for such a long time.
Our village is occupied by the Italians.
But she could still write, my wife.
The letter would make it here somehow... whether from the Netherlands or the United States, it doesn't matter.
No, you will never get a letter from your wife.
- Because she can't write.
That's a stupid joke.
What do you think, Dimai?
It should be possible, somehow.
You're forgetting censorship.
If our people write that they are not doing well... the Italians will burn the mail.
If they write that they are doing well, then our censors will burn the mail.
We won't get any mail from home as long as this rotten war lasts.
The smartest thing would be if one of us-
"lf one of us" what?
I don't know what you mean.
Damn cursed weather.
He has frozen to death.
- Phone the evening report in.
- lt is snowing.
- At dusk a heavy snow storm sets in... - Yes, sir.
- that still continues.
- Again, no combat activity.
- Carriers have not arrived. - Yes, sir.
- Provisions are running very low.
- that's it.
Lieutenant, Behner froze to death.
What?
- Nothing that could be done?
Report that a man froze to death on guard duty.
Why did it have to be Behner?
It won't take long and we'll all go.
If we drill with two machines day and night... we will be below the Austrian cavern within one month... and in another week we will be ready to blast.
Come up here.
I must show you something.
The Italians are undermining us.
You must go to the Great Tower to see where the tunnel opening is.
Quick, let's go!
Ladura, Staudacher, the three of you will join us on patrol to the Great Tower.
Come back in one piece.
What's in those boxes that they're hauling?
Looks like explosives.
Give me the binoculars.
It's just down a slope.
Look, you can even see the various houses.
And the people, you can see the people walking around.
lnnerkofler!
Listen, one went down up there.
Where is lnnerkofler?
A shot to the head.
We waited at the foot of the Tower for darkness to fall... and then returned without further losses, thank God.
Do the others know about the tunnel?
Only lnnerkofler and I have seen it.
Then don't tell the men about it.
They will know soon enough.
Captain Lehner?
I need a drill as soon as possible... so we can drill in the opposite direction... if it's not too late already.
My dear Kall, we don't have one.
The only one we have in our section doesn't work.
I can send you sappers.
I don't need sappers.
By all means, I need drills.
Lehner!
My dear Kall, we don't have any.
Then they'll blow us up sooner or later.
I'll try my best to get you one.
That's all I can do for you now.
As long as they're drilling, we don't have to worry.
Coffee... tea... powder... salt... farina.
- Flour, Mario.
- Flour, flour, good.
I make it with tomato sauce- l tell you.
You have nothing against Italians, do you, Mrs. Pia?
No, not against you, Mario.
But she must cook something for you... so that you get something delicious.
Mommy is coming.
Mario, come here.
There, take the pits out.
- Pits, all right?
Mario, the pits!
- Pia, come.
- Wounded Austrian soldiers have arrived.
Come on, hurry.
Please tell me, are any lmperial lnfantrymen positioned nearby?
Yes, at Col di Lana and Col Alto.
Yes, infantrymen are there.
Do you by any chance know a Dimai, Florian Dimai?
Florian Dimai?
4th lnfantrymen Regiment, 2nd Company.
Dimai?
Hey, we know him.
He fell in Galicia.
Yes, he was among the first.
Come, miss.
- But I must ask him something.
- Not allowed, miss.
- But I must ask him something...
- About my Flori.
- Not allowed.
A nice little horse.
My mommy.
What's going on, Mrs. Pia?
Mrs. Pia, what happened?
My husband fell in battle.
This awful war.
This damn war.
But it's not necessarily true.
Many have been reported dead, but they came back.
We sit around and wait till we blow up.
Out of so many mountains, we must be perched on top of this one.
Let's go to sleep, men.
Xaverl, they stopped drilling!
Say, what's going on?
We must let the lieutenant know.
Quick, Xaverl.
Who will volunteer to go on patrol to Fanesturm?
We must find out whether the Italians... have already begun to arm the chamber with explosives.
Once we know that... we can estimate when approximately they will detonate them... and escape to safety, all of us.
Well, who volunteers?
I do, Lieutenant.
All right, enough.
Dimai, who do you want to take along?
Lieutenant, I'd prefer to go by myself, sir.
One man can slip through more easily.
explosives
- Dimai still hasn't returned?
- No, Lieutenant.
- l have orders for you.
I asked you how you are.
- l was told-
I was told that you fell.
Calm down, Pia.
You know that nothing will happen to me.
Bring my cloak.
How did you get through enemy lines?
Where are you stationed?
Up on top of Col Alto.
Every day we can look down at our village.
All our friends are up there, Ladura, Staudacher, Stürztaler... lnnerkofler-
Yes, lnnerkofler too.
Now you'll stay here, right?
Yes, of course, a few days at least.
I must go back up to my emplacement, Mrs. Pia... but I hope to be back soon.
I already instructed the quartermaster and the provisions will come... even while I am gone.
Good-bye, Mrs. Pia.
Tomorrow night, Col Alto, boom!
Everything will blow up.
I must go back immediately.
You've just arrived.
You can't leave again.
No, you must stay here, Florian.
But I can't leave my comrades in the lurch.
Stay at least for a day, until tomorrow night.
If I don't make it back in time... I will be responsible for the lives of a hundred comrades.
But I won't let you go!
Daddy is here!
I think the Italians have completed setting up their charges.
A company will be at your disposal as reinforcement.
Good-bye, Kall.
I am relying on you and your men.
Now they want to drive us totally crazy... above us, beneath us, next to us, everywhere.
May they go to hell!
Why us 60 men?
If only the whole thing had blown up already!
Something must have happened to Dimai.
He should have been back by now.
That guy will always come back.
Yes, everything is ready.
At 9:00, we detonate the mine.
- Oberbauer!
Go call to report that nothing has happened yet.
After the detonation, the following will need to be done.
If I fall, Platoon Leader Bauer will take command.
If Bauer falls, rifleman Weiß will take over.
If Weiß falls, Staudacher.
To those of you who survive the detonation, I'd like to say... hold the emplacement until the final moment.
You know what's at stake:
Tirol, your homeland.
The telephone line must have been destroyed.
A connection with the command is no longer possible.
One of your own!
Kall!
Dimai!
vienna, SATURDAY, MARCH 17, 1917 WAR PRESS REPORT
During the night of March 15 and morning of March 16... strong enemy forces tried to capture our emplacement on Col Alto.

THE END
Uh, show this young lady to the housekeeper's room, although I think the position's been filled.
Step this way, please.
I came to get the linen job. I hope the clerk is wrong.
You ever see a hotel clerk that was right? Hotel clerks and house detectives.
Just a smile.
Come on, let's have it.
- That a baby.
- Scamp.
Mrs. Snyder, the girl you hired for the linen job is here.
I told her to report tomorrow morning.
She wants to get acquainted with the job on her own time.
Well, I never met one like that before.
Uh, miss Jones, this is Mrs. Snyder, whom you talked to over the phone this morning.
So you're the ambitious kind, huh?
Ever done hotel work before?
Sure. The Julian Dubuque, the Blackstone in Chicago...
How do you know so much about where she worked?
Why, uh, Jimmie, her... Her boyfriend told me.
Well, uh, you won't need me anymore... right now.
I'll be seeing you.
Say, that dame's a pip.
Listen, Jim, your girlfriend got the linen job, didn't she?
Well, uh, I hear she can't come to work. No?
Somebody else got the linen job instead.
What do you mean? Mamie was hired.
Yeah, I know, but... they needed somebody with more experience.
Well, I'm going upstairs and see old lady Snyder.
She's not going to get away with that stuff.
This new girl needs the work.
So does Mamie.
I'm going up there and raise a...
Just tell Mamie that one of the old girls came back.
All set, I guess if I want the job.
What do you mean, if you want it?
I don't want any job bad enough to take away from somebody else.
Whenever you take a job, you take it away from somebody.
- There are more people the jobs in the world.
- Well, it's all over my head. This miss Jones business and somebody's sweetie.
- Anne Roberts.
Listen, Anne, the girl that got the job is a friend of one of the bellhops.
- Everything's fixed.
- What do you mean, fixed?
She didn't want the job very bad anyhow.
They're going to get married in a couple of weeks.
- When are you coming to work?
- In the morning. - Got your aprons?
- No, but I'm going to buy a couple.
I'll get them for you.
Won't cost you a cent.
Thanks... - Bert.
- Bert?
Call me Albert for short.
And let me tell you something about this place.
I've been here six months, and I know.
For the love of Mike,
Stay away from those bellhops.
They can't do a girlie any good,
And the worst monkey of them all Is that guy Bert Harris.
He's dynamite.
Everybody in this joint owes him money From those crooked dice of his.
Well, he can't do me any harm.
I haven't any money, and I don't shoot craps.
Well, maybe you have something else he can use.
I'm telling you He's a good guy to stay away from.
He peddles booze and...
610 wants some fresh towels. 610?
I thought they were painting up there.
I guess they're finished.
Mm-hmm, body and soul.
I never did like bright lights.
Look, honey, I got some hooch and sandwiches
Not a chance of anybody finding us.
I knew you'd come.
That's a fine way to treat a fellow After he gets you your job.
Give me the linen room.
Hello, Peggy?
How about giving little Bertie a big break?
I'm up in 610.
You mean you want me to come right up? Sure.
I'm waiting for you, honey.
Everything's all set. Can you come up?
I'll fly up, big boy.
- Kind of hot tonight.
- Too hot. Shall I do your bed?
Kind of early, isn't it?
Not if you're going to bed.
A bed doesn't mean much to a fellow like me.
Just a place to rest my head.
What a treat for the bed. Yeah.
Say, how about a little nip together,
Just you and me, huh?
Why just you and me?
How about your other friend, The little fellow over there in the green sweater?
Give me the housekeeper.
This is a. Rupert Johnson Jr., Room 334.
Need more towels at once,
And send that same girl back here. Send the bellboy up with ginger ale and ice.
I heard you yelling clear down the corridor.
Here are your towels.
What makes you so hard to get along with?
Mugs like you.
I can be real nice to the right one.
Really? And I suppose the right one's
The first one that comes along.
You know, I'm mighty lonesome myself, And you impress me as being lonesome, too. Yeah?
Well, you got the wrong impression.
Well, let's be friends anyway.
Say, will you do me a favor?
I've got a new line of merchandise. I'd like to see what you think of it.
Come on. Look at it.
A woman is always a better judge of jewelry than a man is, especially a pretty woman.
Here's a dandy.
Here, let's see how this looks on you.
These look mighty nice on you.
You know, they just match your teeth.
Gee, you look swell.
Hey, cut that out! Oh! Oh!
Now look what you did! Those are expensive.
Hiya, Mrs. Dempsey. How's that right cross today?
Aw, come on, honey, don't put on the chill that way.
I sized you up wrong yesterday.
I didn't mean to get you sore.
I like you, Anne, really.
You know, you're the first girl that ever socked me for going for her.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, honey, I'd like to have you sock me like that every day.
Sure, honey, I'd love it.
Took you long enough to get here, kid.
I had to pick out the big chunks of ice.
What's the name of that blonde making up the beds?
I don't know her that well, sir.
I didn't think you did.
You don't look too smart.
Everybody says I'm very bright for my age, sir.
I can't get anywhere talking to you.
Maybe you'd be surprised.
Never touch the stuff while I'm on the job.
Besides, I never drink anything but my own.
Here, you might try this.
Say, that's pretty good.
That's what everybody says.
That chambermaid you asked about likes it so well she won't touch any other.
You sell that stuff?
Can't afford to make a gift of it.
That's high, isn't it?
Not if the blond chambermaid likes it.
The name's Bert.
Hello, babe.
I've got something for you. Here's the 5 bucks I owe you.
For what? You don't owe me anything, unless it's an apology for bothering me.
No, take it!
It's a commission on the booze I sold that mug in 334.
He bought it when I told him you liked it.
After all I told you, You went and fell for this shrimp's line, You dirty little tramp.
It hurts me more than it does you, honey.

Honey, I'm Santa Claus, Robin hood, and the goose that laid the golden egg all in one.
Pretty big package, aren't you?
Seriously, there's a lot of loose money lying around if you only know where to look for it.
The world owes me a living. I'm not built for work.
That's for horses and smack-offs like that 4-eyed room clerk.
Now, you've got beauty and a swell figure.
With my ideas and your looks, we could trim the world.
And end up in the penitentiary.
Not with what I have on the ball.
Now, listen, honey, here's the idea.
The age of chivalry has passed.
This, honey, is the age of chiseler.
And the age of jails.
Everybody's got larceny in his heart.
Everybody's looking for something for nothing.
Honest men are scarcer than feathers on a frog.
Oh, I know Bert. I've never been mixed up in a racket before.
As I said, there are two things I haven't any use for, and jail is both of them.
You play ball with me, and your worrying days will be over.
How about the nights?
Well, I'll see what I can do about those, too, honey.
Sorry to disturb your little party.
Oh, we were just going, so it's alright anyway.
Not alright with me.
Parking without lights is pretty serious. A lot of accidents these days.
Oh, tell him to take that horrid light out of my eyes.
The... the lady objects to your flashlight.
Maybe she can't stand close inspection.
I-I-I resent that.
Alright, alright, Come on, the both of you, get out.
Now, look, here, can't you and me get together?
What do you mean, get together?
Aw, just forget all about it.
Go on, get yourself a smoke.
Come on, lady, you get out of there.
Listen, partner...
There's nothing to listen to.
This is a nice mess.
What's your husband going to say when he finds out about this, Mrs. Lawler?
Oh, he's a friend of my husband.
Why, I didn't know you were married.
Well, you know it now.
No use standing here.
In the car and we'll get going.
Well, wh-where to?
Headquarters.
I can't go there.
Neither can I. I've got a wife.
Why, I didn't know you were married.
Come on, snap into it.
Hiya, Mr. Johnson!
No, parking.
Hiya, kid.
Mr. Johnson here is a friend of mine.
So's the young lady a friend of his.
Who is it?
Why, it's Anne Lawler.
This is news.
- What have you got them on?
- Plenty. Parking without lights on a county highway, possession and transportation of liquor, - bribing an officer of the law...
- That's a lie.
Well, we won't stop to argue that.
Go on, get back in your car.
It looks pretty bad, Mr. Johnson.
Hey, Bert, can't you do something?
My name, my reputation, the newspapers.
This guy's a tough mug.
Listen, I know this guy pretty well.
- You want me to see what I can do about him?
- Sure, and stop at nothing.
I'll be ruined if this gets out.
Hank certainly looked like a real cop.
Why not? If he can't impersonate John Law, nobody can.
He's been pinched often enough.
Here you are, honey... $2,500 for you and $2,500 for me,
With the compliments of room 334.
What's the matter, baby?
Come on, snap out of it.
We ought to be celebrating this touch. Here you're acting like this. - Come on, pick up your end.
- I can't take the money, Bert. You keep it.
Oh, no, no, take it.
It's yours, partner.
50/50.
I'm awfully tired.
Uh, you can sleep in the lower and I'll take the upper.
You don't mind, do you?
You see, I was in such a hurry when I bought the tickets, I just got one compartment.
I sort of figured you'd be in a hurry when you bought the tickets, Bert, so I bought a berth in the next car.
I'm sure you'll sleep better that way.
Oh, I mustn't go without letting you know how much I care for you, Bert, dear.
And this, commissioner, is our local larceny Lane, where money's made easily and lost quickly.
Take a look at the house detective giving us the once-over.
You look, babe.
I haven't got my glasses.
Where did the horse come in?
Come in? He's still running.
I laughed till I thought I'd die.
I'd give a million to have seen that chap's face.
You should've seen his expression when I told him I still had his letters.
My motto is... speak all languages and write none.
Swell-dressed parade of parasites, aren't they?
Worse than all the gangsters and hoodlums put together.
Better sit over here, Bert. You're blocking traffic.
Anybody who doesn't like this should have his head examined.
I'd like it better if there was some money coming in.
Don't worry about a thing, honey.
Everything'll be super.
$5,000 can't last forever.
We've spent almost $1,000 already.
The chump's wad is still intact.
All we spent is what I saved.
We'll get set, baby.
It's making the right connections takes the time.
See that guy?
He's in the rackets.
I've seen him hanging around the hotel.
He's doing better than alright.
Look what he's pushing around.
She is attractive.
That's the best part of being in the big dough.
You can canvass the field and have all the dames you can use.
Is that your ambition?
Well, no, not exactly, but, uh, you can't blame me for looking around, honey.
- You won't give me a tumble.
Well, I could go for you. Sometimes I think I even want to.
You're nice.
You're not a collar ad, but you're not bad-looking either.
But just when I get set to fall, you spoil everything.
- Just this: love doesn't mean anything in your life.
You think you can turn it on and off by pushing a button like you do a light.
You worship nothing but dough.
No, you're not my type, Bert.
You got started on the wrong foot and Little Nell is not going to be just another in your life.
I say you're wrong. Maybe someday you'll find out.
I may not know much about making love, but this one thing I do know.
I've wanted you since the first day I saw you, but if I can't have you, I'll have somebody else.
We're getting too serious.
Hey, I told you once before to cut that out.
Yeah, because I don't like it.
- Is that so? - Yeah.
Well, kid, - I want to thank you for fronting for me.
- Oh, that's alright. I don't like guys who swing chairs.
I'm Dan barker.
This is Miss Wilson.
I'm Bert Harris.
Miss Roberts. - How do you do?
I've seen you around the hotel, haven't I?
Oh, I hold open house now and then, yes.
Do you two live here? No, just me.
Miss Roberts lives at the embassy.
I live around the corner at the Wellington. Really?
Then we're almost neighbors.
Well, uh, how about finishing this dance?
Well, if I can dance with you, Mr. Harris, I'll feel perfectly safe.
Keep the home fires burning.
The minute I saw you, Bert, I knew you were one of the boys. - Yeah?
- I... don't like to play with strangers, but you look alright.
You can depend on me, if that's what you mean.
- Things are pretty tough right now. - Same everywhere.
Just to pass the time away, I'm working a new deal.
It's out of my usual line, but a buck is a buck.
- Keeps the wolf away.
The only reason I'm talking to you is you've got an honest face and clean hands, and that's very important.
You ever been mugged, uh, arrested?
No, never took a fall.
How much dough can you raise?
- Well, I got about $2,500.
- I said dough.
That's nothing but coffee and money.
- That's all I've got.
- Well, how much can you promote?
The more you come up with, the more you can make.
Money goes to money, you know.
Yeah, I know that...
If all you can promote is a couple of grand, forget it.
Make off like I never talked to you.
Maybe I could get as much again from Anne.
Who's that, your sweetheart?
No, my partner.
Well, alright.
You meet me in the lobby, say, uh, at 1:00 tomorrow,
And I'll show you a couple of angles that will blow your hat off.
Alright, 1:00.
Yes, I know, but...
Now, will you stop worrying about Dan?
Dan's a nice guy and I don't want to be making a chump out of him.
Oh, forget it.
He has his friends, and I have mine.
How nice for you.
I wonder what happened to Bert and Helen?
Where have you been? We've been looking all over for you.
Mm, I'll bet you're all tired out.
It's been a nice evening, Dan, thanks to you.
It's been a pleasure, Bert.
Oh, wait a minute.
- A package of Merits.
Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't got anything lower than a $20 bill.
You can't annoy me with money, any kind.
We'll be going home. Good night, kid.
See you tomorrow. Good night, Dan.
You've been a wonderful host. The next party's on me.
- Good night, little girl.
I've had a very pleasant evening.
Are you going my way?
This suit of armor's worse than that bellhop's outfit.
Bert, I don't like that fellow.
Nope, I can't use him.
You've got to get used to him and get to like him, because you're going to see a lot of him in the next few months.
We're going to do a little work together.
That racket of his sounds like a darb.
Why, I didn't see any racket.
Dumbbell.
Didn't you see every time he bought anything he paid for it with a $20 bill?
- He pulled it just now at the cigar counter.
I wouldn't like it if it was good. Because I don't like him. No?
I know what's bothering you.
You're burned up by that blond dame.
Why should I be jealous of a bleached-out bag like that?
Of all the conceited apes I ever saw, you take the cake.
That's one of the million reasons I'd never go for you.
I wish you could get it in your thick skull that I'm not at all interested in your lady friends. No?
Well, we're going in with Dan whether you like it or not. This is business.
It's not a beauty contest.
Oh, you make me sick.
You mean that blonde makes you sick.
Anne, are you there?
Is it alright for me to come in?
Hey, what do you mean crashing in like that? - Can't you see I'm taking a bath?
Seriously Anne, this is important.
I just came from the bank, and the cashierhanded over 4 good 50s for 10 of those phony 20s. That's how good they are.
- Looks great to me. - Yeah?
Mm-hmm, only my $2,500 isn't enough.
Dan barker does things on a large scale, and I need at least $5,000.
Well, count me out.
Well, we're still partners, ain't we?
I made money for you before, and I can do it again.
I guarantee you can double your money in 24 hours.
Come on, baby, what do you say?
It don't sound good to me, but if I don't give you the money, you'll probably steal it, so take it, my friend.
Where is it?
In my brassiere.
- In my brassiere.
You got pockets in that?
I've taken money out of a lot of funny places, but never anything like this before, honey.
I hate to break in on you like this.
That's alright.
- Did you get the money?
- I got the 5 grand.
- What's all the excitement?
- Now, here's what happened. Kansas City Dutch, that's the guy I get these 20s from, is blowing town tonight.
The cops are on his tail.
I got the call. We got an hour.
Now, here.
Here's $10,000 of mine.
Put it with your $5,000.
- You stick pretty close to that, dont'you?
- Very.
I want you to do a little bargaining.
Only don't take no for an answer.
- But why me?
- Well, I'd do the talking, Only Dutch would figure I was a chiseler and fold up.
Now, here... Here's the idea.
You just give him the $15,000, and insist on $45,000.
$25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000.
There you are.
If the cops wasn't so hard on me, and I could stay around town, you'd get $30,000 or nothing.
Well, lot of luck, Dutch.
Next month, if I keep out of the can.
I'll get in touch with you.
Hope you get into some real money by then.
You can't keep a good man down. You bet.
Well, be seeing you.
Put it in the grip. We'll divide it at the hotel.
It sure looks good. I can't tell it from the real McCoy.
Then nobody else could, either.
You'd better keep it tonight.
No use me carrying that kind of money around the streets, makes me sweat.
Put it in here.
It's me... Helen.
What's been keeping you?
Don't I ever get tired of waiting?
But I was just leaving, sweetheart.
Come on, have a nightcap with me.
All I need to fall asleep is a bed.
Come on, Dan, don't be so inconsiderate.
Okay, I'm blowing, Bert.
Get yourself some rest, and tomorrow we'll have one grand day laying the green.
I'm itching to start.
Where is Anne tonight?
Oh, out with some other guy.
2-timing you, eh?
No, we're not that way.
We're just partners.
As for me, I'm very much in circulation.
Maybe I can get rid of Dan some night and we can go out together, alone.
But don't get caught.
Now listen kid, lock this door and sleep with one eye open.
Chances are I won't be able to sleep at all.
See you in the A.M. - Goodbye.
I never saw anyone so stupid in all my life.
The poor chump.
You know, all smartened up from that goofy scrapbook.
He thought that real money you sold him was counterfeit.
Yeah, he said it looked perfect. He couldn't tell it from the real stuff.
What a mug.
Miss Roberts, please.
Hello, Anne? It's Bert.
Listen, honey, I won't be able to see you today.
Something came up that's going to tie me up.
Is anything the matter?
Don't worry about a thing, will you?
Alright. If you've still got the money, hang on to it.
Sure. I've got the money in my pocket right now.
Yeah.
I'm Mr. Alexander Porter's secretary.
And I want to select a diamond bracelet.
Mr. Porter just announced his daughter's engagement, you know?
Yes, I read about it.
Would you step this way, please?
Show this gentleman some bracelets.
This young man will wait on you. - Thank you.
What did you have in mind? Anything in particular?
Uh, let me see these.
How much is this one?
$15,000.
This is very nice, I think I'll take this one.
That is, pending Mr. Porter's approval.
Would you mind sending it to his residence, 1516 Lake Shore drive, immediately, - and charge it to his account, please.
- Thank you very much indeed, sir.
- I shall have it sent within the hour.
- And may I have your card, please? Certainly.
Thank you so much, Mr. Roland.
Package for Mr. Porter from Gorman Co. Will you sign, please?
Very good.
Hello, is this the residence Of Alexander Porter?
Yes. This is the Porter residence.
This is the Gorman jewelry establishment calling.
Through an unfortunate error, a package intended for another of our patrons was delivered at your house.
The package is right here, sir.
Our Mr. Roland will call for it immediately.
R-O-L-A-N-D.
Would you mind giving it to him when he arrives?
Yes, sir. Mr. Roland.
I will expect him, sir.
Oh, thanks so much. Thank you.
So, uh, I'm Mr. Roland of the Gorman company.
Oh, Mr. Roland, your manager telephoned me to expect you.
Maybe it's too nice.
What'll I do with it? That stuff is hard to sell.
Who cares, give it to your wife for a Christmas present.
Listen, 3 balls, I want $5,000 and I want it in a hurry.
It's worth $20,000.
Don't give me any back talk.
Well, don't get excited.
We can talk it over.
I don't want any talk.
I want 5 grand, and I want it now.
Alright, I'll...
My, but you're a tough guy.
Not tough, just mercenary.
Dan didn't take me, but he tried to, and that's what burns me up.
How much did we lose?
Not a dime, I was too fastborn.
I got all our original dough back.
That's a break.
What's a break?
Listen, I don't invest money just to get it back.
Dan promised me a profit, and a profit I'll get.
What's that got to do with this trip to New York?
Nothing, except that Dan barker, the rat, Is headed that way himself.
I guess you didn't have much time to say goodbye to that blonde, did you?
Isn't that too bad?
Oh, Bert, sometimes you act like a kid.
You lie, and you pout, and you won't give in.
- Who's lying?
I'll pretend to believe you, Skippy.
- That's alright.
Oh, what's the matter? Something in your eye?
A cinder, I guess.
- Oh, may I try and take it out?
Now look up.
Oh, it's not very big, is it?
No, just a little fellow.
Well, my name is Reynolds, Joe Reynolds.
- And mine's Anne Roberts.
- I'm afraid our etiquette's a bit reversed.
Yes, I guess Emily Post wouldn't approve of looking into a lady's eyes before being introduced to her.
Well, maybe Emily post couldn't appreciate such eyes as yours.
But seriously, have you anything to wash them with, some antiseptic or something?
No, but they must have on the train.
I'll ask the Porter.
I have some boric acid in my bag.
I'm in the next car.
You talk like a physician.
- And how do you feel now?
- Very much better, thank you.
- Do you do much traveling?
- Well yes, you see, my firm is a member of the New York stock exchange, as well as that of Chicago and Boston.
They keep me jumping pretty much.
This will be my first visit east in several years.
Oh, here comes my partner.
Bert, I'd like you to meet Mr. Reynolds.
Something flew in my eye, and Mr. Reynolds was kind enough to remove it.
Lucky for you I wasn't there. You'd probably be minus an eye.
Partners are unfair.
Because I have two eyes,
Mr. Harris would expect me to give him one.
Well, I must bathe my eye.
Thank you again, you've been awfully sweet.
Well, I hope you'll give me the opportunity of seeing something of you in New York.
- Shan't we see more of each other on the train?
- How about breakfast?
- I'm delighted to have met you, sir.
- Oh, uh... the pleasure's mutual.
Little girl like 'em nice mans?
I think I could prime that chump for a take.
He looks like ready money.
Is that all you ever think of, Bert... swindling somebody?
Why don't you take them one at a time?
Yesterday you were going to follow Dan around the world.
Now you've forgotten all about it.
I haven't forgotten anything.
Only why shouldn't we take Reynolds?
- He isn't any better than anybody else, is he?
- Maybe he is. I sort of like him.
As long as I do, you lay off. There are plenty others.
This is the first time I've ever seen you weaken.
He must work fast.
You should take a few lessons.
It's tough nowadays.
Sometimes I think I'll go legit.
You couldn't.
Trick laws and shyster lawyers won't let a guy go straight.
Say, who's the dame over there?
- Miss Roberts.
- How are you, Mr. barker?
Well, we meet again.
I ate at that table.
Bring me the check, will you, and a fresh pot of coffee?
Am I taking you from someone?
That mug's just out of the big house.
More solitary won't hurt him.
You're sure looking great.
Say, whatever happened with that young squirt? Bert was his name, wasn't it?
You were never meant for a chump like that.
Did he ever tell you how we took him in that fake counterfeiting gag?
He fell for that hook, line, and sinker.
I took him for 5 grand, and the payoff was the note that Helen left for him...
"paste this in your scrapbook.
Love and kisses, Helen."
By th way, where is Helen?
I sent her back where I got her from.
Have her on a 30-day free trial?
Exactly, and all she cost me was the down payment.
What are you doing these days?
I got a brand-new racket.
- Hello, baby.
- Ready to eat?
- Sure. I'll put on my hat.
You sit down and rest your hands and face.
Browning.
Not really.
"To Anne. This book so suitable.
Joe."
You never told me.
"No shade encroaching on the matchless mould "of those two lips, which should be opening soft
"in the pure profile,
"not as when she laughs"...
"For that spoils all.
But, rather as if aloft "yon hyacinth she loves so, leaned its staff's
"burden of honey-colored buds to kiss
"and capture 'twixt the lips apart for this."
Now, honey, I ask you, is this the kind of hooey that guy Reynolds hands out?
Why, I think it's lovely.
He may be a poet to you, he's just a peasant to me.
I'm starved.
I could eat the hip off a horse.
Well, I'll go with you, but I'm not very hungry.
I had a late luncheon.
Whose guest do you think I was?
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Einstein.
You'd be very interested.
Oh, the high and mighty Joe Reynolds, I suppose. The poetry shark.
No, I saw Joe yesterday.
We had lunch together, and I met his father.
Who else, then?
Dan Barker?
Why, certainly.
I said we had luncheon together.
Well, I'll bet he laid off me.
You're all we talked about.
He's living at the Saint Anthony.
He always stays at the best, doesn't he?
Just let me get my hands on him, he'll stay at the best hospital.
What did he have to say about me?
Everything, and by the way,
I have a message for you...
Helen sends her love and kisses.
The dirty, yellow-bellied, double-crossing burglars.
And you laughing at me with him!
A fine partner you are.
Why don't you put in with him? You'd make a swell pair, you two.
- Aw, get away from me.
You're as wet as he is, always rubbing things in.
Oh, you talk like a child.
Now, before we go any further, tell me how you got the money we came here on.
Well,
I stole a necklace from a jeweler and sold it to a fence.
Stole it? Stealing's not your racket.
Well, I didn't exactly steal it.
I pulled it neatly enough. You can bank on that. But I was desperate.
I had to get your dough back.
But out-and-out thievery's not your style, Bert. The worst you ever did was take from wise guys, cheat a lot of cheaters, but this thing...
You might've been caught.
But I wasn't.
You don't think I was that clumsy, do you?
Bert, you're such a boy.
You'll never grow up. Oh, I'm sorry I got into this whole business.
At first, it was clever and shrewd, but now that we've resorted to this, I suppose next week you'll rob a bank or something.
Sounds like some of Joe Reynolds' influence.
Well, I can't stop you, if you want to turn yellow and quit.
This isn't some of Dan Barker's work?
You haven't fallen for his line, have you?
No, it's not Dan's work.
I'm not going to take a run-out powder, either,
Not now, anyway.
I'm going to stick with you. I'm going to even up the score with Dan Barker for you.
He took our dough, and he's going to pay.
He made you resort to common dirty thievery. We'll make him resort to worse than that before we finish.
That a baby.
You had me worried for a minute.
Come on, now, what are the plans? Never mind.
You asked me before if I was hungry.
Well, come on, I've got an appetite now.
That gets it, baby.
You got a great idea, Anne.
I got to give you credit. And believe me... this old gent bellock's stuck on me.
He'll do anything I say. I have to have somebody to work with,
And I like you, Dan.
- You're my style. -
- And you were made to order for me, honey. If your man's as good as you say, we'll take him for enough to blow the country.
What time does he get in?
Usually early in the morning.
He stays at the Miranda.
Oh, fine.
I got everything set. It's our first job together.
Hello, Mike.
Hello, Dan. Your car's ready.
Everything's ready.
Let's be on our way.
I'll slip on a dress make it snappy, honey.
I consider myself fortunate, getting to town before this meet broke up.
You're right, colonel.
There's some great horseflesh out here now.
This track is becoming more important every year. It certainly is.
Not a major stable missing.
And the management is perfect, I hear. Void of fraud, And no stigma of unsportsmanship whatsoever.
Beyond criticism, colonel, we're mighty proud of that.
As it should be. The sport of kings should be respected.
Will you be ready soon, dear?
Just a minute, colonel.
I've got a run in my stocking.
How did you like the golf course?
Splendid, very sporty.
Anne and I played 18 holes this morning.
I'm very fond of this entire hotel.
Hurry, dear, we'll miss the first race.
Just a minute, colonel.
Oh, these women... I think I've waited 1,000 years for them in my time.
But they're worth it, aren't they, colonel?
Looks as if we missed that first race.
And it's all my fault.
I kept you waiting. Oh, that's alright.
Although I did have a horse picked in that first race, a sure winner, colonel.
Oh, here, look them over.
Why not bet between yourselves? You, Dan, pick a horse, and you, colonel, book.
Not a bad idea if the colonel wants to be a sucker.
Quite the contrary.
I'd consider it very sporting. Well, it's a swell way to pass the time.
We're still a half-hour from the track.
Hello, Louie, who won the first race today?
Some mighty good horses in that first race.
Captain's boy is my choice at 2-to-1 odds.
How much do you want to bet?
Well, say $500?
Why not make it $1,000?
Alright.
Shall Anne hold my money?
Surely, if you can trust my sweet little friend.
Who won the second race?
The second race.
Okay, okay.
Fine time to run out of gasoline.
- Why don't you look out for these things?
- Sorry sir, I never knew the tank was near empty. Hurry up, will you?
Well, I guess the second race is on by now.
Say, do you want me to keep book this time?
No, you bet.
I'll be a real bookie.
What's your choice this time?
Well, this time I'll take high ball. Sounds like a good thing in these prohibition days.
Same amount?
No, let's make it $1,500 this time, so if I lose the first race I won't be out so much.
Okay, here you are, little stakeholder.
Suppose we take the third race.
Betting this way is as much fun as at the track.
Yeah. We've been delayed so much, I suppose the third race is on now.
Well, I'll take a chance on Queenie.
I've taken a chance on Queenies many times.
Stop now, colonel.
Same amount... $1,500?
How'd you like to make it really interesting?
How about $5,000? Can you cover it?
Sure I can.
The sky is the limit.
Okay, colonel.
Well, there you are, Anne.
Hang on to that, you'll probably be giving it back to me in a little while.
You didn't pick a winner in the whole lot.
I won all three bets. Here you are, colonel.
You sure are lucky. Oh, the boys at the club will be knocked cold when I tell them this.
What the devil happened?
That chauffeur of mine double-crossed me, I'll cut his heart out.
Don't worry, Dan.
$40, $60, $80, $100.
There you are, baldy...
I mean, colonel.
You did swell. I've got another $100 coming, ain't I?
Nothing doing. You did it so well, you can do it again without our help.
You flatter me.
Here, Mike.
That's worth your trouble, isn't it?
- You said it, baby. - Now you fellows lay low.
Dan Barker is probably looking for you right this minute.
They'll never cath me and the colonel.
We're going to blow this burg right now.
Thank heavens that's over with.
You have no idea how hard it is to put up with getting pawed by someone you don't care for.
Are you satisfied with our revenge?
Isn't that a darn sight more gratifying than just punching him in the nose?
With all this dough in my hands, how can I say you're wrong?
Is money all you ever think of?
No, Anne. Money is just a means to an end with me.
There's always been a lot of things I've wanted to do.
I wanna go to Europe. I wanna mix with those swell people and see all those swell places.
You know, we could go together.
Here's your end of the take.
I suppose you will want to buy yourself a separate stateroom.
Listen, Anne, I'm nuts about you.
Simply because I don't say it the usual way and say the usual things doesn't mean that I mean it any the less.
Oh, I don't know.
I want you, that's all.
That's sweet of you, Bert.
I wish you'd said that long ago.
Why? It's too late now, Bert.
I'm in love with somebody else.
If you had told it to me like that six months ago, it would've been different.
I wanted to hear you say it.
Why didn't you tell me then, Bert?
Who is it...
Reynolds?
Yes, Bert...
I learned something going around with him.
On those weekends with his family and all that,
I met different kinds of people.
They're a whole lot different from our friends, Bert.
They like music and art and all that sort of thing.
Oh, I don't know. It seems like a better way to live, that's all.
So I'm going to quit all this.
I'm going to marry Joe.
I understand, Anne, and you're perfectly right about me and the kind of life I'm used to living.
You'd be in for an awful lot of grief if ever you married me.
I'd be holding out or pulling a fast one on you before the rice was out of your hair.
I suppose if I caught the iceman hanging around, I'd ask for a cut of his profits,
And as for the butcher... well, wouldn't I look like a swell smack-off in one of those aprons, washing dishes?
I'd be a flop at this marriage business.
Now, if it was a racket, nothing could stop me.
Congratulations, old gal.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
What is it the disappointed suitor always says?
"name the first one after me."
What is it, a wedding or a funeral?
How did you like Europe, Bert?
Hmm... stinks.
I tell you, Bert, this deal is a honey.
No big touches, but the money's there in the grind.
After a year's layoff, it ought to come in handy.
Sounds alright, Jerry, but I'm not interested. I can't get interested.
I don't know what I want, kid.
It's the greatest thing in the world.
Did you ever see one of'em?
I hope it brings you luck, Jerry.
I don't know how you can pass it up.
I can get them made up for 2 bucks a gross.
I got a half a dozen stenos a $20 a week that do nothing but look up deaths in the obituary columns all over the country.
Then I send out a swastika charm addressed to the dead guy... C.O.D. $3.50.
$3.40 profit on each.
Not big dough, but what a volume.
What a volume. Pretty, ain't it? I can peddle more than 500 a week.
No, Jerry, I'm afraid you can't drag me in.
I've been away so long it all sounds strange.
Uh, why dont' you take a trip to China or somewhere?
You can't do yourself any good around here if you feel that way.
Why don't you get married?
Wait here.
- Hello, Anne.
Come in. How did you ever find out where I lived?
Well, I managed.
Well, little stranger, How do you like married life?
Alright, I guess.
You don't look very happy.
I'm not. You were a chump for passing me up.
I always told you I was a bargain at any price.
I have something to tell you, Bert. Something dreadful has happened.
It can't be as bad as that.
Let me buy you a drink. No, thanks.
Bert, Joe has used some of the firm's money in a deal he thought would make him a fortune.
It didn't work.
He lost it all. And now it's up to you to get him out of it.
And this is the guy you held up to me as so respectable, so straight and clean... he and his father and his books and his music?
And now you wake up and find out he's an embezzler.
I've come to you for help, Bert. Because you're the only person I know to ask.
I want you to loan me the money so that Joe can make good his losses to the firm.
The books are audited the 30th. That's the day after tomorrow.
How much is involved?
Hmm. That's a lot of money.
I haven't got it, Anne.
I haven't turned a trick since you left. I'm living on principle, and as you see, the layout isn't so cheap here.
Well, I didn't know, Bert.
I quit when you did.
I couldn't go on without you.
I lost my punch. - Where'd he get the money?
- From the firm.
Yeah, I know, but was it in cash or did he juggle his accounts or what?
No, he took negotiable bonds from the vault.
He has his own key, and he knows the combination of the safe.
He's trusted there.
He's been with them for years.
I see. He's with Werder Lawrence, isn't he?
Well, listen, Anne,
Tell Joe he can expect a visit from me in the morning.
And... have him take me to his own private office when I get there.
- What do you plan to do?
- Never mind.
Everything's going to be alright. - Just tell him to expect me.
- But, what are you going to do?
Wait a minute. Our partnership was dissolved a long time ago.
Go on home, Anne.
Everything's going to be Jake.
Where's Mr. Reynolds' office?
First door to your left.
I didn't intend to steal the money. I meant to return it.
It's the sort of thing that could happen to anybody.
It's happened to lots of guys.
They're up in Sing Sing now. Anne said you could help me.
I'll pay you back.
You won't lose anything.
I can't lose anything, because I haven't got anything.
When you married Anne, I lost the only thing I ever had.
Is there any more dough in this safe?
Yes. There are bonds going in and out the whole time.
Why?
Why, no, they wouldn't...
- But that's robbery.
That would be too bad.
Well, there's probably $40,000 worth of bonds in the safe now.
Any negotiable?
No, of course not. If there had you'd have grabbed those, too.
- Look here, you...
- Shut up!
Give me the keys to this place and the combination to the safe.
Go on home and forget you ever saw me.
Take Anne out somewhere and be sure that you're seen by a lot of people whom you know, in case you do need an alibi.
In the morning, they'll find the place robbed and the safe open.
They'll pick $40,000 worth of non-negotiable bonds lying in the alley.
They'll figure that the thieves threw them there, keeping only the stuff they could dispose of.
That's great.
I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it for Anne, you smack-off.
Here's the combination to the safe.
You put it down.
Not taking any chances, are you?
Left 9-7.
Right 2-3.
Stick them up.
Swing around there.
Alright, Joe, frisk him.
Follow that brown sedan.
You can only stay a few minutes.
Hiya, honey.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Anne.
Don't take it so hard.
Things could be worse.
Oh, nothing could be worse.
What do you mean?
What's happened? I just found out that Joe double-crossed you.
Double-crossed me?
Oh, don't you understand? That's why you're here.
He had the cops waiting for you.
You mean to say that after all we tried to do for that guy he'd pull something like that?
Oh, it's impossible, Anne. Nobody could be so low.
Oh, it's not impossible.
Oh, that dirty, double-crossing rat.
I'd like to get my hooks on him.
Oh, if I could only get out of here.
You're not going to take the blame. I'm not gonna do it.
I'm going to district attorney and tell'em the whole story.
No, you mustn't do that.
You'll only put yourself in a spot.
I'm not thinking of myself, Bert. It's you.
I got you into this mess. I'm going to get you out.
Stay out of this, or they'll find out about us.
Anne, I'm in.
You can't help me. It'll just be my word against Joe's.
Oh, I've got to do something.
Besides, you don't owe me a thing.
I got you started in this mess when I talked you into the rackets.
Well, I'm not going to let you take the blame.
I went into this thing with my eyes open because I loved you, Bert.
I always have, but it's taken this to make me realize it.
You mean that, Anne?
Of course I mean it, more than I ever meant anything in my life.
Your time is up.
Whatever happens, no matter what it is,
If I had the wings of an angel, honey, Over these prison walls I would fly.
Maybe you could do better if you'd crawl on your hands and knees.
Some day I'm gonna sock that guy...
- right on the beezer!
- Hey, you, Dink. Lay off of that stuff.
If there's any fighting in this family your old man's gonna do it.
Alley-oop!
How much further is it to Tijuana?
About three miles.
Go on, or I'll run on top of you.
- Want me to carry you?
- No! What do you think I am, a sissy?
Say, Dink, if them promoters get me that fight, I'm gonna buy you a horse.
Gee, a real horse?
Certainly. What do you think it is, a wooden horse?
Hey, what happened to the atch-pay I sewed on the anny-fay?
Gee, I must have lost it.
Does it ow-shay?
Well, I guess it's your underwear.
It'll give you plenty of air... through there, anyway.
Gee, I think that's enough for today, don't you, huh?
You've done swell, Champ. Ain't he, Jonah?
- You bet your boots!
Let me tell you something.
Them promoters ain't got a chance of turning me down tonight, have they?
- No, they'll grab you up.
- Here, feel that muscle.
- It's getting big, ain't it, Jonah?
Look at those punch muscles in the back.
I'm just as good right now as I was in the old days.
- You know I am.
Tell you what you do, you stay here and play with Jonah a little while.
I'm going to run over and play a little of that there Kelly pool.
Champ, you've had enough exercise for today.
This ain't exercise.
This is just a little let-down... a relaxation, you know?
Hey, Champ! Champ, wait a minute.
Oh, no! You know I wouldn't.
Didn't I tell you I wasn't going to drink anymore?
I haven't had a drink for three weeks and you know I wouldn't take a drink... going to meet them promoters tonight, don't you?
There ain't no pool tables in that place.
Doggone if I didn't forget that!
This one shows him wearing the diamond belt.
Looks great, don't he?
There he is, right after the bout with Battling Kelly.
Look at him, not even a scratch.
Sure, he was the greatest fighter in his day.
Now, here he is...
How did that get among these?
Now, this one here shows you his muscular development.
All there, ain't he?
Hey, Dominick, have you seen the Champ?
No, he ain't been over here.
All right, gang.
Wait here, gang.
Boy, oh boy. Give me another drink, Louie.
Nix, Champ. Forget it, Louie!
Well, if it ain't a little spitball.
Go ahead, Louie!
Those promoters from Los Angeles are up at the place waiting for you.
Oh, darn it, I forgot.
You can't let them see you've been drinking.
Get some ice and tell Curley to open you a can of tomatoes.
They've been there for over an hour.
Gosh, why did you have to go on a binge tonight?
Listen at him bawling me out.
I'm gonna be good from now on, Dink.
- Honest, I am.
- You said you'd behave. Oh, gee whiz!
- Rub his neck with the ice.
- Come on, Champ, drink.
It'll do you good.
- Drink? Sure.
No, that ain't what I ordered.
- Boy, you got to straighten up.
- Who's dribbling down my back?
- He's coming around now.
- See if you can stand up.
- Oh, I can stand up all right.
Your old man's okay.
I'm always okay.
You guys better scram now. I got him, Jonah.
Okay, Dink.
The air didn't make you feel bad, did it, Champ?
No, I feel good.
- Put your feet out one after another.
Ain't no more than fair.
Only, seeing you guys came all the way from Los Angeles...
- Live and let live, that's my motto.
- Hi, boys.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Hi, big boy.
There you are, Champ.
- What's your proposition?
- How's your condition, Andy?
He's tip-top. Better than he ever was.
Sure, ain't stopped training a minute. Hardly.
We got him doing roadwork, skipping a rope, shadow boxing.
Why, only last week he tore up three punching bags.
Certainly. We could've matched him with Gene Tunney, if Gene hadn't quit.
Something I ate.
Booze-fighting and box-fighting don't mix. You know that.
- I don't get you.
- Why, you're cockeyed right now!
What do you mean, I'm cockeyed?
Just like you were the night you lost the Championship.
You big palooka!
The mug.
Is that all right?
Of all the nights, you would pick tonight to get stinking!
- Yes, and I could...
- Lay off of me will you?
Go on, scram.
You, too, Sponge. Get out of here.
You don't believe what they said about me being drunk... the night I lost the Championship, do you, Dink?
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
I'm gonna lay off the booze, word of honor.
I'm not gonna gamble anymore.
You hear what I said, Dink?
Yeah, I heard you, Champ.
You ain't mad at me, are you?
No, I ain't mad.
- Well, goodnight, Dink.
- Goodnight, Champ.
If the Champ wins this fight, he says he's gonna buy me a horse.
Hey, Kadinkus.
Hey, Dinkey.
Here, spit on it for luck.
You know that cartwheel that you spit on for good luck?
Well, it brought it!
I made 14 straight passes... and doubled up each time.
And was Joe sore!
Oh, boy, he was sore.
Oh, he's burned up.
It's yourn.
Thanks, Champ.
Genuine Stetson.
Feel the felt.
That's yourn, too.
Hey, Dink. Come here and have a look.
- Could you go for that?
- You mean the...
The horse, sure. It belongs to you.
It's yourn!
- Oh, I won it from Joe.
- Gee! Mine?
- Sure he's yourn, just like I said.
- Look at that. Ain't he swell?
- Gee!
- He's a race horse, ain't he?
- Well, he was in a race once.
- They call him Butterfly.
- Butterfly?
That's a heck of a name for a swell horse like this.
We got to change it.
I tell you, we'll call him "Little Champ" after you.
That ain't a bad idea, huh?
- And we can enter him in a race soon. - Sure.
We can fix him up, can't we, Tim?
- I should hope to tell you.
- Gee, can I sit on him?
Well, I guess he's been sat on before.
Alley!
Oops-a-daisy! Hey!
- Hey, give me my hat.
- Isn't he a swell horse?
Yeah, sure he's swell.
Gee. Oh, don't do that. Somebody might be looking.
Oh, what do we care whether they look or not?
Gee, I'll bet he can go a mile in 20 minutes!
I bet he can go a mile in just-like-that.
Hello, beautiful baby! Baby, hello.
Oh, don't you do that to your mama.
Baby, you're gonna win a big old race.
I'm from The Herald-Examiner. Would you and Mrs. Carlton mind...
- posing for a picture with Blue Boy?
- Yes, darling?
- We're going to have our pictures taken.
Well, well. Come on, Blue Boy.
Now, Blue Boy belongs to Mrs. Carlton, doesn't he?
- A birthday gift from my husband.
- I see he's a favorite today. - Who?
No, Blue Boy.
- My husband's a favorite every day.
- Step just a little closer.
- Just a little closer.
Now, nice smile. That's it. Fine.
Say, lady, I wouldn't bet on that horse if I was you.
If you got any money, you better stick it on my horse here.
- Is this your horse? - Sure, it's my horse.
Well, he's a pretty good-Iooking animal.
Pretty good-Iooking, my eye!
He's gonna win the race today.
Well, I think if you know, I'll just have to put some money on him.
- Little Champ.
Little Champ?
Dink.
I think Dink's a pretty name.
- Well, Linda ain't a bad name, either.
- Tony... this young man says that his horse is gonna win this race.
Well, now, that may be a good hunch.
What's the name of the horse?
- Little Champ, eh?
- I'll tell you what I'll do.
- I'll bet $50 on him.
- $50?
Gee, that's a lot of money.
How about it, Dink? Is that a safe bet?
Plenty safe!
I'd bet my last two bits on him.
Say, Dink, I don't think I've met your little friend.
Oh, this is Jonah, my pal. Meet Miss Linda.
- Glad to know you, Miss Linda.
- How do you do, Jonah?
- He's colored.
- So he is.
- Kind of a pretty color.
- Yeah, ain't it, Jonah?
Hi, Dink.
Hey, Benny, come here.
Hey, now, listen. Little Champ is fit to run, see?
As fit as we can make him.
Andy, the guy was right in the next stall to me.
- Who was with him? Linda?
- Yes.
There he is now.
- I thought you never came West.
- We're spending the winter in California.
- Linda and I.
- The nerve of that guy.
- What did he say, Andy?
- Can you beat that?
They're coming out for the fifth race.
Number one is Chester Queen.
Number two, Phillip Ramble. Number three, Romp.
Number four, Capt. Gilbert. Number five, Blue Boy.
- Number six, Little Champ.
- Come on, line up that horse!
Number seven, Van Ettish.
Number eight, Selma Bobby.
Chester Queen goes through the barrier.
- Did you place the bet?
Now they're taking him back to his stall.
They're getting set. They're moving in.
Little Champ is fractious.
There goes Little Champ through the barrier.
Why, Tony, dear, you look as if you had seen a ghost.
Now they're lining up once again...
They're getting set.
They've lined up evenly.
They're off! There they go!
Going past the grandstand the first time...
Capt. Gilbert leads by a head.
Blue Boy in second by a neck. Little Champ is third by a half-length.
Blue Boy leading easily by one length. Capt. Gilbert second by a length.
Van Ettish, fourth by a half-length.
Little Champ dropping back into the pack.
Stop pulling my hair!
Swing around the turn into the backstretch.
Capt. Gilbert creeping up on Blue Boy for the lead.
They're well out in front. And now...
Little Champ is moving up on the leaders.
It looks like Little Champ has a chance yet.
Blue Boy is first... but Little Champ moving up fast.
He's moving up fast.
What a race!
Little Champ is now coming right out in front. He's out to win!
He's out to win!
There they come, down the stretch!
Wow! He stumbled.
What a shame, he had the race won.
There they go, past the finish.
Blue Boy wins!
Capt. Gilbert, second, and Romp is third.
- Are you all right, Benny?
- No, Dink, he's all right.
- He's all right.
- He's killed!
No, he's all right.
Here, keep your chin up.
Oh, he's killed, I know it, by golly!
No, he's all right.
Dink, he's all right.
- He's broke his leg, that's what he did!
- No, his leg's all right, Dink.
He's got for sure a broken leg.
- No, keep your chin up.
He's all right. - All right, Dink.
He's all right, Dink. There you are.
- Look, he's all right.
He just stalled and lost his wind.
He's all right, sure.
- Go on and pet him. Attaboy.
- How are you, Little Champ? Gee wiz.
- See, I told you the horse was all right.
- Sure, I told you.
- I told you.
Look at that man with Dink!
Yes, Linda, it's Andy.
- Then Dink is...
- Oh, Tony, let's go and see.
- No, you stay here, dear.
- Gee, Dink, that sure was tough.
- He didn't break his leg, did he?
I was supposed to buy groceries with them two bits I lost.
- What did you do, lose two bits?
- All right, now don't go gambling anymore.
Go on, take him over to the stables.
Sure tough on the kid.
Not so good on us, neither.
We're flat again.
- Yeah, well, we've been broke before.
Is Dink Linda's child?
Well, if I remember correctly, she had something to do with it.
She'd like to see him, Andy.
No, she washed the both of us up a long time ago, didn't she?
Your marriage to Linda was a mistake. There was no love in it.
Oh, at that time you were World's Champion... glamorous, important.
- She was fascinated.
- Yeah, I wasn't in her class.
That was the mistake.
You came along and she gave me the gate.
Well, that's done with, Andy.
Let Linda see the boy.
The court gave me the custody of the kid and I'm keeping him.
- You got a kid of your own, ain't you?
- Yes, we've got a little girl.
- But Dink is Linda's child, too.
- No, she's got you and a new kid.
I got Dink and we remain as is.
She'd give anything in the world to talk to him, Andy.
Money, if you needed it.
If I needed it?
Gee, I'm just crawling with money.
I'm round-shouldered from carrying it around, Tony.
Here's $100 now.
Bring him to the hotel in the morning and there'll be another $100.
Well, I'm not very crazy about doing this, Tony.
When a fellow's got a lot of bad breaks and things are tough... why, he'll do things that he won't do when everything's flush, you know?
- I'll bring him over.
- Thanks a lot, Andy.
Now, let's see how you look.
Turn around front.
There's one of those tags.
When you go up there I want you to act like a gentleman... just like your father is.
You wish something?
Do you have to wish for something around here?
Now you're all set. All right.
All right, Sponge, you take him up there and don't let him out of your sight.
And don't forget that other $100, do you hear?
You leave it to me, boy.
Ain't you coming?
- No, I'm gonna wait here.
- Come on, Dink.
You got another one of those things right there on you.
- Oh, gosh!
- Can you beat that?
Now, let's see. Turn around. Take off your hat.
I thought I told you to wash them this morning.
- Well, I washed my ears good enough.
- Well you didn't wash in back.
Now go up there and be a gentleman just like I am.
Don't forget that other $100. Go on.
Everything will be all right, Andy.
I got to go in and collect some dough first.
- I'd like to see Mrs. Carlton, please.
- Come right in. She's expecting you.
Some gum. Gee.
Think I'll take three more.
I'd better not leave any there.
Some candy.
Think I'll take some.
What's in here?
Boy, I think I'll bring some home for the Champ.
Guess that's enough.
Hi there, Champ!
What are you doing up on that roof? Get down from there. Come on, before I knock your ears off.
- Do you like fairy tales?
Have you read the one about the Sleeping Beauty?
It's about a princess that slept 1,000 years.
That's a lot of hooey.
How could anyone sleep 1,000 years?
It's only a fairy tale.
I'll say it is.
And all the time she was sleeping, didn't she ever eat?
It doesn't say anything about that.
Did you ever try going without breakfast?
Try it sometime and see how empty you get.
And this princess goes for 1,000 years without even eating a sandwich.
- Bushwa.
- I'm awfully glad you're my brother.
The dame's nuts.
- How far can you spit?
You watch me.
- See? - Okay, Dink.
- Oh, hello, Linda.
- Hello, Dink.
My, I'm glad to see you.
Say, I'm awful sorry about you losing your dough yesterday.
That was all right, Dink.
Ain't that the reason why you wanted to see me?
- No, that's not the reason.
- Ain't it, Linda?
This ain't a bad dump you got here, you know that?
- You like it? I'm glad you do, Dink.
The Champ and me ain't fixed up as swell as this, but our joint's more lively.
It's right above the Greek's saloon, you know.
And I like to listen to the piano playing... while I'm waiting for the Champ to come home nights.
Does he leave you alone at night much, Dink?
No, he takes me pretty near every place he goes... especially when he shoots dice.
I'm good luck to him.
But when he goes on a binge... I wait up in the room till he comes home. Then I have to put him to bed.
Dink, you're awfully fond of your father, aren't you?
I mean, you like him an awful lot.
Like him? Gee, the Champ's the greatest guy in the whole world.
Gee, you ought to meet him sometime.
I'm telling you, you'd like him.
- I have met him, Dink.
Hasn't your father told you who I am?
He says you're some dame with a lot of jack.
Has he ever talked to you about your mother?
Well, you see, she kicked the bucket before I was born.
I heard it some place.
Dink, I'm your mother.
- What you trying to do, kid me?
- No, Dink.
I really am your mother.
Cross my heart.
Well, then, why ain't you living with the Champ and me?
Well, you see, we disagreed... and I'm married to Mr. Carlton now.
That little girl you were talking to is your little half-sister.
Well, then, you ain't married to the Champ anymore?
Well, then, I guess you're not my mother.
What you crying about?
Oh, Dink. Dink, I am your mother.
Nothing that ever happened between your father and me can alter that.
Well, you don't need to cry about it.
- Do you, Dink?
Do you? - Sure.
Dink, wouldn't you kiss me?
Oh, no, Linda, I don't kiss dames.
Oh, please, Dink, just once.
Well, what's the good in it?
It would make me awfully happy if you would.
Well, they wanted that one thing very... Well, they wanted it.
- And that was all there was to it.
- Okay, Sponge.
- So long.
Say, come down to Tijuana sometime and I'll show you around.
So long, Dink.
Well, Tony, good... So long.
Goodbye, Dink.
Oh, Tony! We can't let that baby stay in that atmosphere another minute... now that we've found him.
I'll never forgive myself.
We've got to get him away from it.
- Tony, we've got to.
- Will you leave it to me, Linda?
Hey, where did you get them cigars?
She sent them to you.
No, don't, Champ, please.
Well, that's different then.
She make any cracks about me up there?
- Suppose she's got a swell joint.
- Smells nice.
Got pretty flowers in the garden, too.
Yeah, I guess you went around and smelled them all, huh?
All I'd do was spit on them.
Yeah, I suppose our place will look like a dump after seeing that place of hers.
Well, did you get it?
Well, what are you holding out for?
Here, Dink, spit on it for luck.
We'll run that up to a million.
Okay, Champ.
Dink, that hit him.
Boy, what are we going to do with all that jack?
First of all, me and Dink is gonna get a new room.
That joint down at the Greek's, that don't smell so nice.
- Maybe we'll leave Tijuana.
Well, maybe, perhaps.
You never can tell.
I'm dying on my feet, Champ.
Listen, we can't quit when we're going so good.
I'll quit in a minute.
Dinkey, boy.
That's a natural.
I think we're going into a new business.
Oh, you're sure hot today, ain't you, Andy?
Hit them, baby.
Here, I'll show you how to make a 10.
What do you want, a 10?
That's a cinch.
There's a 10.
There he comes. There he comes, six!
Here, you shoot them. But use your own dough.
- What's the point?
- $1.
Well, spill it.
Linda and I have a proposition to make you, Andy.
Give us Dink for six months.
We want to do something for the boy.
Well, send him to school.
Give him a different environment.
He's got plenty of environment right here.
I know you love him, Andy, and Dink loves you.
But this sort of... Oh, give the boy a chance.
Let Linda have him.
I thought she'd pull something like this.
I got to keep counting to keep from smacking you down.
I've got close to $3,000 on that table.
I'm going to send that boy to school and I'm going to be the one... to dress him up.
He and me is going to travel.
If we wanted to be nasty, we could take the boy away from you.
You know, you're not a very good father.
You better go on while the going's good.
Give me them dice.
I'll shoot $100!
Let's go home, Champ.
- There's a natural seven.
Don't you want me to spit on the dice for luck?
You'd give them halitosis.
Okay, Andy, sign it.
It is Dink's horse, Whitey.
I must have gone nuts to gamble him away.
Dink will die if he finds it out.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If you can raise the money within a couple of days... I'll let you have him back.
We won't say nothing, Andy.
Goodnight, boy.
Hey, Dink. We're heading for home.
What time is it, Champ?
You want me to carry you?
No, I got legs.
Did you have bad luck?
Well, tomorrow's another day.
Cheer up.
Goodnight, Andy.
No, I can do that, Dink.
Here, you're all tired out.
Give me your hoof.
You ain't feeling sick, are you, Champ?
No. I feel fine.
I got to get up early this morning.
I got to go over to the track and see Little Champ.
You know, I ain't seen that guy... since day before yesterday.
Well... you better sleep late this morning.
Growing kids need a lot of sleep, Dink.
Come on, hop in.
Ain't you coming to bed, Champ?
Sure. In a little while.
Well, goodnight, Champ.
Goodnight, Dink.
And that's McGonnigle. He won yesterday's race.
Little Champ wasn't running.
Hey, now watch, gang.
Hey, Little Champ!
Hey, what's the matter with you, you old hay-burner?
Ain't you got any sense?
Stick your head out when your master's voice calls you.
Gee! Hey!
Hey, bring my horse back!
Wait a minute, that's Dink's horse!
Champ, do you know what they did?
They just took Little Champ away, just now.
Yeah, I saw them.
I lost him last night, Dink.
I'll win him back... just as soon as I can get some dough, I'll get him back.
Now, listen, Dink... don't take it hard.
I didn't know what was going on... and he went so quick... and well, you know, those things happen... and, gosh, I'm sorry about it.
We're going to get him back.
Come on, get your chin up.
Come on, be a big fellow and get your...
Go on, get that lip up before you lose it.
Come on. Up with the ippy-lay.
Come on. Up with the lip.
Come on now. Give us a smile.
Come on, a little smile.
I'm going to get Little Champ back for you now... just as soon as I can get a hold of some money.
- Are you?
- Sure I am.
Sure, wait a minute.
I got a little old... four-bit piece here you can spit on for luck.
I guess.
No, I don't guess I have.
Well... here, spit in my hand, just for luck.
Now we're going to get a bankroll, you hear? And we'll get Little Champ back and...
Andy, wait.
Andy, won't you reconsider letting us have Dink?
Can't you see the advantages we could give him?
A good home... decent environment, friends.
We could send him to a good school.
Andy, he's old enough to decide for himself.
Perhaps he'd like to live with us.
Andy, won't you ask him?
Well... that's fair enough, Linda.
I'll ask him, we'll see what he says.
- Will you, Andy?
- Sure, I will.
Eak-stay?
O-nay.
Orn-cay.
Orn-cay?
- Utter-bay and alt-say.
- Utter-bay?
- Here. Alt-say and epper-pay.
- No epper-pay.
- No epper-pay?
Anks-thay.
You're old enough to... make up your mind about what you want to do, ain't you?
And you wouldn't like to go to military school, would you?
- Well, it's just like a prison.
Everybody has to dress in uniforms... and they have to drill all day... and you wouldn't like that, would you?
You wouldn't like to live in a great big home, would you? One of those great big barns... nothing cozy like... well, like our joint, for instance?
And you have to be dressed up all day... and wash all over three or four times every day.
You wouldn't like that, would you?
- Wash three or four times a day?
- All over?
Nothing doing!
You got plenty of environment right here, ain't you?
Sure, I'm full up.
Full up.
- Well, I got your horse back.
- You did?
- Down in my barn.
- Gee, that's swell!
Come on, Stinky!
Little Champ's back!
Well, you got my money, Andy?
How much was that?
You know how much it was.
$300, was it?
Yeah, that's right. I guess you're right.
$50, $150... $200, $250, $300...
Wait, don't rush me. Don't push me, now.
Let me figure this thing out.
Let's see if you can... guess the number of the bill.
You starting that game again?
Who's starting who's who and what again?
- You keep out of this, will you?
- Shut your face.
- Odd or even? Odd or even?
- I want my dough.
Well, wait a minute. Let's go take a drink... and then we can talk it over.
- Sure, that's what we want is...
- Go on, get out of here!
Come on, odd or even?
I want that dough.
- Gee, don't Little Champ look great?
Sponge says he looks like Man O' War... only he can't run as fast yet.
All he need is practice.
- It' s a beef!
Somebody's pinched!
Let's go to the jail and find out who! Come on!
Last one there's a sissy!
Come on, kill him!
- Give him the raspberry, Dink!
I ain't going to stand for no...
Nuts!
Looks like your pappy, he done it again.
Ain't you slept?
Thinking?
Holy mackerel, what a joint.
You'd think a respectable bedbug would have better sense... than to stay in a dump like this.
Say, who started that beef, anyway?
Oh, I remember.
You started gambling and lost all the dough for the kid's horse. Then you accused Whitey of using loaded dice.
Then that made Whitey sore and then you sloughed Whitey. Boy, then things started.
Well, I'd never do a thing like that.
Use loaded dice. I got caught too many times.
I'm giving Dink to his mother.
I ain't no good.
He'll be better off with her.
You'll have a tough time getting rid of him.
I'll get rid of him all right.
Maybe he'll forget me.
I had a swell old man... but a couple of years after they hung him, I forgot all about him.
Champ?
Well, Andy, in again, huh?
Brought you something to eat, Champ.
You take that kid over and pack up his clothes... and then... bring him over to the hotel to his mother.
Because I said so.
You're going to stay with your mother from now on.
Oh, no, Champ, I want to stay with you.
Well... that's tough because you're just out of luck.
Well, you're going to go to school... and learn something... and grow up to be somebody.
I'm tired of feeding you. Let her feed you for a while.
You're hanging around every place that I go... and I don't like you, that's all.
I won't eat so much, Champ.
And I won't hang around you.
I'll stay up at the Greek's... and wait till you come home nights.
I wish you wouldn't send me, Champ.
Gee, I can go to school here.
The Fathers asked me a lot of times.
I could grow up to be somebody.
Somebody like you.
No. You're going to go to your mother's.
I'm not going to have any sniveling around.
You're going to stay with her... and I'm not going to have any more backtalk from you now, that's all.
No, sir, Champ, I ain't going to go.
I'm telling you I ain't gonna go!
- I'm telling you I ain't gonna...
- You're going to go.
- You're going to your mother's now.
- I don't want to go.
Oh, no, I want to stay with you. Please!
You're not going to.
You're going to your mother's, Dink.
- I wanna stay with you...
I'll go if you don't want me.
Go on, scram out of here.
Cut it out, Champ! What are you trying to do?
Gee, I hit my kid.
Don't do that, Champ, you're breaking your hand.
Don't do it, Champ.
What's the matter? You going crazy?
Time to go to bed, youngster.
I've got good news for you, Dink.
I pulled a few strings today and your father's home again.
You mean you got him out of jail?
You know, Dink, I think you're going to like New York.
You'll like school, too.
We thought it would be nice if you went to the same school I attended for years.
You'll get riding and drilling and target practice.
Oh, yes. Yes, he was fine.
Well, did he... Did he...
And I told him you were getting along fine.
Well, that's what you'd want me to tell him... isn't it?
Say goodnight to Mary Lou.
Goodnight, Mary Lou.
Father, come and kiss me goodnight.
Goodnight, son.
Hello, Dink.
Just thought I'd help you get settled.
Here's your toothbrush and toothpaste.
Could I help you, darling?
I can undress myself.
Got kind of a little cold, haven't you?
You know... my eyes and nose, well... they've been running something awful.
That's too bad.
Let me help you, huh?
No, I can do that.
Could I take the other one off?
Oh, Dink, you don't know how happy I am to have you here.
Well, I think you better go now.
All right, Dink.
I'll go and see how Mary Lou's getting along... then I'll come back and tuck you in, huh?
San Diego... stop here 15 minutes.
Are you all undressed, dear?
Are you nearly ready to be tucked in?
I'm already tucked in already.
Gosh, I'm tired.
See you in the morning, dear.
You got to snap out of it, Andy.
Now that we got you that fight with those promoters, you're laying down on it. You should be doing some heavy training.
Oh, what's the use?
I don't need to train.
Why, if I could only get a little shuteye, I'd...
We know what you're going through, and we're with you, no kidding.
But we got to grab this chance. We may never get another one.
Why, if they come up here and find that you're not up and doing...
That don't make any difference.
Let them find me.
Let them take the fight away from me.
What's the difference? I don't care whether I fight or not.
Thought I'd come and see how you was.
You got a cold, ain't you?
No, I'm just sort of crying.
No, no you ain't.
Gee, boy, but you look swell.
Ain't much life to a suit of clothes... but they ain't so bad.
Why, you had a manicure.
Oh, I just scratched it a little bit.
Been feeling all right again?
Sure, I'm feeling fine.
Gee, I'm feeling great.
I haven't had a drink since I got out of jail.
- And I don't shoot dice no more.
Gee, that's swell.
- Tomorrow I'm going into training.
Yeah. Feel the muscle.
- Gee, it's like iron.
- Just like steel.
Feel the stomach.
Hit it.
Hit it hard.
Hey, did you know I had a fight all lined up?
- Sure, all set, ready to go.
Gee, that's swell!
Say, there ain't no reason why I can't come back, is there?
If I do, why, I'll get us a girl that will follow us around... and do nothing but look after our fingernails, huh?
Couldn't we get a couple of men to do that?
We can get us four men.
And I'll get you a new suit and a pair of rubber boots.
- Real rubber?
- Real rubber boots and a shotgun.
Say, a shotgun that goes "kablooie" and...
Oh boy, that's swell!
And we can travel.
And we can go down to Paris...
- Georgia, and Des Moines, Missouri.
- Oh boy!
- Gee, that's keen!
- Won't that be swell?
Oh, gee!
- You broke the window!
- What do we care?
Come on, don't get your chin down there. Come on.
- Come on, hit him in the...
- Chin!
That's what I said.
Andy, you ain't showed a thing yet.
You look at it.
Gee, that guy's good.
Boy, look what he's doing to his sparring partner!
Dink's old man ain't got a chance.
Gee, look at his left.
- It's faster than lightning.
Boy, he's...
Well, what do you think of the Mexican now?
Come on, Jonah.
That guy didn't look so good to me.
His footwork was terrible.
I don't think he could fight at all.
Not at all.
Gee, Champ ain't got a chance.
But this is a fight he's going into, Tim.
Come on, lop ears. Hot groceries.
Hiya, Dink.
Hello, Dink.
You tired, Champ?
Well, I'm a little tired.
I got a lot of catching up to do... but I'm doing it all right.
I want to talk to you about that.
About what?
Well, about this here fight racket.
I don't seem to like it.
I thought you was strong for it.
Well, I've been thinking it over, you know, Champ?
I like you lots better when you're not training.
Well, for instance, when you got a couple of drinks in you... well, you're a lot of fun.
I thought you didn't like me drinking.
Well, I was wrong, Champ.
Now that you quit gambling... I got practically nothing to spit on.
Well, when I was gambling I lost all of our dough and I lost the horse... and I think we're better off now that I've quit.
We used to have a lot of fun... and now you're training most of the time... and we don't get to see much of each other.
Hey, now, what are you getting at?
Well, you was the World's Champion once.
Everybody knows that.
What do we care about you being champ again?
And fighting this Mexican ain't gonna get you much.
Well, if I win, it will get me $20,000.
- Who cares about that?
With that dough, why, I can send you to school... and I can get Little Champ, and you and me can travel.
Oh, I don't have to go to school.
You didn't go to school, I bet.
Yeah, I know that, but that's the reason that you have to go to school.
Hey, listen... you ain't trying to get me to throw this fight, now, are you?
No, Champ.
Come on... let's go get some grub.
No, thanks, Champ.
Oh, gee whiz!
Well, what do you say, Doc? Everything all right?
I guess you'll get by all right. But you don't want to work too hard at first.
You know, you got to be mighty careful.
That old heart isn't any too strong.
Well, it's working pretty hard.
Say, listen, the last championship fight, that old heart was doing nip-ups.
Everything was all right.
- Well! Hello, Tony!
- Hello, Andy.
- Where did you come from?
- Linda and I came down to see the fight.
Now remember, Andy, what I told you.
Say, listening to you doctors make those undertakers rich.
Well, Tony.
Well, I suppose you're back to try and get the kid again, eh?
No, we know we can't do the impossible.
We can't separate you and Dink.
So we're not going to try anymore.
Now you got a lot of sense.
Say, this is going to be some fight.
I'm going to make an enchilada out of this big palooka and eat him.
Say, it's a cinch.
Linda and I have been talking things over, Andy.
We don't want you to take any chances.
Chances?
Say, I wouldn't have that kid see me lose for anything in the world.
Dink's gonna be proud of his old man.
I'm going to win that fight tonight. Everything is gonna be okay.
Hello, there. Say, when did you get back?
Couldn't stay away, just had to see this fight.
- Did you put any money on it? - Did he?
I'll say he did.
- Yeah, you're gonna clean up too, boy!
- Andy, will you let's go, we're on next.
Quit your squawking, kewpie. I'll be there.
Good luck, Andy.
- All right, this as a walkaway.
- Hello, gang!
- Good luck, Andy!
Attaboy, Andy!
- What about the horse?
- Waiting outside.
You got him outside?
I'll have the dough for you right after the fight.
For the love of Mike, Andy. Come on!
The main event of the evening:
Ten rounds of boxing.
Introducing, at 210 pounds... the former Heavyweight Champion of the World...
Andy Purcell.
At 205... the Heavyweight Champion of Mexico...
Manuel Quiroga.
Bob Perry, referee.
Take your time, boy.
Let him fight himself out.
I'll tell you when to commence.
- Keep it coming up, Andy!
- Up!
Keep that left up, Andy.
You're going swell, Andy. Keep it up and the fight's yours.
I've given him everything that I've got.
You've got plenty left, Andy.
He hit me a couple of terrible wallops here.
What did you say, Champ?
Everything will be okay.
Now is the time, let him have it. Don't give him an inch.
Let him have it quick.
I don't think he can take them in the middle.
Keep working on that stomach now.
Tear in.
Let him have it from both sides.
Go to it, boy. Stay with him now.
Nice doing, Andy!
...three... four, five, six...
One, two, three... four, five, six, seven...
Go on, save yourself.
Hang on, Andy, save yourself!
One, two... three... four, five...
- Ring that bell!
...seven, eight, nine...
You're doing fine, Manuel.
You nearly knocked him out.
The bell saved him.
It's all right, take your time.
Give me that smelling salts.
Hey, here's the water.
Frankie, is he hurt?
Is he unconscious?
What's the use, Andy? What's the use of going on?
- Let's quit, will you?
- No! I can whip him.
The odds are too big, Andy. You can't buck him, boy!
No! I can whip him!
Daddy, I'm scared what he's doing to you, that's all.
- I don't want you to go in.
I'm all right, Dink.
- I'm gonna throw this towel in.
- No, don't! No!
I'm surprised at you.
Don't, Champ, please!
- Come on, Tim, get him out of here.
Spit on that for luck.
Go on, please, spit on it for luck.
Come on, spit on it, Dink.
Shoot the works.
- Andy! To your neutral corner!
- He's down!
They're counting him out! Get in the corner!
...five, six, seven... eight, nine, ten.
Out!
Well! I better go easy, huh?
Not as good as I used to be?
Great fight, Andy. I'm proud of you, boy.
- Have you got the horse?
- Sure, take a look.
- Dinkus, look at that.
- Little Champ!
Yeah, he's yours this time for keeps.
- Go and get him. - Hooray!
Whoopee!
Hello there, Little Champ, how are you?
Gee, I ain't seen you in such a long time.
Gee, I'm glad I got that horse.
I am, too, Andy.
Come on, let's go. Let's get in that dressing room.
All right, Champ.
- Champ! What's the matter?
Frankie, get the doctor. Quick!
- What's the matter, old boy?
Doc, he flopped outside.
Nothing, Dink.
All of a sudden I turn sissy... and faint dead away.
The ground came up... and socked me right square in the face.
I won the fight, didn't I, Dink?
I'll say you did.
Ain't you proud of your old man now?
Gee, Champ, I always was.
And you was going to throw that towel in... and stop the fight.
Ain't you ashamed of yourself?
Nix, Dink.
Keep your chin up.
Give the old man a smile.
Keep it...
Champ, open your eyes!
It's little Dink talking.
Please open your eyes.
Doctor, what's the matter? What's the matter with him?
Come on now, Dink. You've got to be brave, son.
Why is the Champ acting that way?
He never has before. Why doesn't he talk to me?
Well, but the Champ is just tired, you understand.
No, it ain't so.
I want the Champ!
Tim understands.
Champ's gone on a trip.
No! Go away! Let me go!
I want the Champ! The Champ!
Steady, Dink. I'm your pal.
I want the Champ! I want the Champ!
Don't worry, Dink.
We'll have a lot of fun from now on.
Dink, be a brave little boy, will you?
Be a brave boy.
But I want the Champ!
Dink, everything will be all right, Dink.
Oh, Tony, yeah.
But you... Oh, go away!
Go on!
The Champ is dead, Mama.
Oh, sweetie... you'll be all right, darling.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure we'd all like to welcome an old member back into our midst,
a member who has, for the last three years, been traveling in the Orient.
I refer, of course, to Mr. Hardy Livingstone,
who comes back to us bearing several scars which he claims were inflicted by tigers, but he doesn't say whether they were male or female tigers.
Bet I could tell you, Hardy.
But those of us who know our Livingstone have our suspicions.
But I shouldn't be picking on Hardy, because he's promised to do us a great favor.
He's promised to lend us that magnificent house of his for the Milk Fund Ball.
I'm sure we all appreciate this, and I'm also certain that we'd like to hear a few words from Mr. Livingstone.
I dare say that when I tell you that I'm glad to be back, it sounds, to say the least, banal.
Banal!
Careful, Hardy, ladies present.
But my delight at being here is so genuine that nothing I say can be banal.
Hardy, leave the room.
It's a good word. Stick to it.
As for any possible generosity of mine in letting you have your Milk Fund Ball at my house, don't consider it as that.
Hello, Jeff.
Hello, Leslie.
Hello, Jeff!
You're late, you lucky dog.
They're still out there making speeches.
Big plans to raise money for the Milk Fund.
I don't know what they're going to do with all the milk when they get it.
I suppose somebody likes it.
Big welcome home to Hardy Livingstone.
Big offer of house for something else.
I make the one and only excuse and sneak out.
Then I fool them and don't come back.
Is my wife in there?
She fools them, too.
She matches coins all during the speeches and doesn't have to listen.
Don't be sanctimonious.
Pretty easy for you to stay at the office tonight yourself, wasn't it?
I stay every night.
By golly, I believe you do, at that.
Just came across me.
I haven't see you play golf all summer.
I can't get away.
I've got a couple of deals on the fire and I can't leave them, that's all.
That's a crazy way to live.
You shouldn't work so hard.
What's it going to get you?
A million, I hope. Someday.
Well, I wouldn't do it for any man.
Neither would I, but for a certain woman.
Well, she's pretty nice.
I don't care much for them as a race, but she's pretty nice.
She's wonderful, Leslie.
I didn't begin to live until I met that girl, and there's nothing in the world I wouldn't do for her.
You're going to have me crying in a minute.
Come on, let's have a drink.
Where's Jeffrey?
Oh, he had to work, poor darling.
Isn't it awful? I'm glad I'm not a man.
I couldn't bear to have so much on my mind.
I'm the helpless type, darling. Didn't you know?
I think I'll gamble.
We're not gambling, dear.
She certainly cleaned me out tonight.
Are you coming, darling?
It's bad luck to talk, but I'm promoting something that may turn into gold any day.
You know, I take a positively clinical interest in this man.
What's the trouble?
He's in love with his wife.
And after four years, too.
Can't help it, boys, I'm sorry.
Why don't you do something about it?
It's worse than that, it's indecent.
Here's to her.
No, the Oriental woman isn't really a slave.
She's simply been well trained, that's all.
She knows her business.
What about the tiger?
It really was a tiger, but as a matter of fact, it brought me luck.
Luck!
I'll have to give you an IOU until tomorrow evening.
I'll cut the cards with you.
If I draw high, the debt's canceled.
If not, I owe you $10,000, instead of five.
Aces high.
I followed you out here.
I should.
Indirectly, you made me lose $10,000.
You were talking behind me in that very carrying voice of yours.
I heard you say the word "luck. "
I thought it was a hunch.
I should feel badly, but I'm flattered.
Well, you needn't be.
It wasn't your personality, Mr. Livingstone, just your very loud voice.
Could I redeem myself by buying you a drink?
Do you like Japanese wine?
Oh, well, I never knew they had Japanese wine in the club.
Not at the club, at my house.
It will only take us a moment.
My boat's alongside.
Will you?
As a climax to the evening's indiscretions?
You're not afraid to take chances?
Oh, no, I like to take chances.
All right, come along.
If I go, will you tell me all about the world, Mr. Traveler?
It's round, they say, but I've always found it quite flat, until now.
How frightfully exciting.
I'd like to see your house.
This is my holy of holies.
I suppose you smoke opium here, and hold all sorts of exotic rituals?
Opium has never agreed with me, but in the Orient, some of us use it as you would cigarettes.
Oh, how dreadful!
That depends upon your point of view.
It's Yama, the god of destruction.
Would you dare open it?
Would you dare look at it?
Well, is it so frightful?
I call it my gallery of ghosts.
Why, they're lovely dolls!
Once they were lovely women who were kind to me.
Oh, Bluebeard's chamber.
Well, I should say that your past had been rather international.
Perhaps in knowing many women, one is able to appreciate the one woman when she comes along.
How negligent.
One shelf unused.
I still have a few years to live. Mmm.
I suppose this is her name, or have you forgotten their names?
That's my crest.
It's a Japanese character.
I brand all my belongings with it.
It means "I possess. "
What a strange man you are.
How few people seeing you at the club realize you are like this.
You're really two men.
I don't know either.
What's behind that door?
Somebody's head strung up in a closet, I'm sure.
Worse than that. Oh.
Well, I must admit, you're very clever at planning your conquests.
Yours.
Ours.
It belonged to a Siamese princess.
Oh, but it's marvelous!
I couldn't.
I made you lose tonight.
Won't you take it as some slight return?
They're real, aren't they?
Why, it must be worth a fortune.
It would be worth twice as much on you.
You'd look wonderful in it.
You must wear it for me.
Let me see you in it.
You won't accept this?
But why must you hurry?
My husband will be looking for me.
Are you in love with your husband?
Isn't it too bad?
But I really am, you see.
When shall I see you again?
I'm awfully busy.
You will be at the Bazaar on Wednesday. I'll see you there.
This is Mr. Livingstone.
He was nice enough to take me up the shore and show me his new house.
It's really too beautiful.
That was nice.
If you'll excuse me?
I shall hope to see you soon.
Livingstone? Mmm.
He hasn't a very good reputation with women.
Oh, Jeffrey, do you think I was born yesterday?
Sometimes.
Oh, now, don't be cross with me, please.
Darling, you mustn't mind if I'm a little jealous.
You know why it is.
It's because I love you more and more every day.
Oh, sweet!
Go on making love to me.
I'd like to, but somebody might see us.
Oh, shocking!
Young matron necking with husband.
I'm not your husband.
Gracious.
I'm your lover.
Always?
Always.
Even if... If at times, I do things that don't please you?
Mad things?
Because you know, Jeffrey, I am mad.
Mad about living.
Things going round, I love them.
Ferris wheels, train wheels, roulette wheels.
You think I'm crazy, don't you, darling?
But you'd never let me go, would you, Jeffrey?
I'll never lose you, will I?
You will if you don't haul in a little on your expenses.
Oh... Money.
Well, we have to have it to live, and we have to talk about it now and then.
Are we broke again?
Not exactly, but we'll have to watch ourselves until this deal comes through, because it will pretty soon, and when it does, we'll have all the money we want.
You're not angry because I...
You know, darling, I'd give you anything in the world.
Would you give me $10,000 now?
$10,000!
Oh, Jeffrey.
I was only joking.
Come on, darling, I want to go.
I want to go home, and I'm going to drive.
I want to drive fast!
$14,612.
My, what a lot of money.
Must have been a great success.
Yes, it was.
Well, it deserved to be.
The girls have all worked so hard.
Oh, we loved it.
Well, we want you to be. Otherwise, you might take your house away from us.
No. I wouldn't do that.
Well, we wouldn't let you.
We've made all our plans.
It's to be Oriental, you know.
Last year we used the American Indian motif, and by the most peculiar coincidence, practically all the members came as Pocahontas,
Which the Board objected to, because they said there was some doubt as to whether she really married John Smith.
Yes, as soon as I get the money.
I wouldn't even bother to put it in the bank, because we want to give it to Mr. Durkin on Wednesday.
I'll guard it with my life.
As long as I can keep it away from this man, everything will be easy.
Goodbye, darling.
Did you notice how he never took his eyes off her one minute?
Now, now, girls, no gossip!
How do you mean, he never took his eyes off her?
I'm going to drive by my house.
I must go straight home.
My place first.
You see, I've decided that you should wear the Siamese princess' robe to the ball.
No, I couldn't. Really, I couldn't.
He might object.
Besides, I know how valuable it is.
I'd be frightened something might happen to it.
I'm determined you shall wear it.
Perhaps I'm just as willful as you.
Perhaps, but you'll compromise.
Vanity. Oh.
Take the package inside.
You not only make me take it, but you make me feel positively virtuous in doing so.
My motives are entirely selfish.
I want to see you in it.
Oh, take that upstairs and give it to Rita, will you, Jones?
There's a gentleman to see you in the drawing room.
Who is it?
Yes, Mrs. Carlyle, I know, but...
You didn't have to come here to my home!
Well, something happened today, something that makes it necessary for me to collect at once.
I can't do it today.
But Mr. Carlyle...
Give me two more days.
Surely you can do that.
Very well, but I must have it then, or I shall be obliged to present the IOU to your husband.
Anything else, Mrs. Carlyle? No.
Hard day?
You'd think, from the way they talk downtown, that the whole country was going to be put up for sale, cheap, in six months.
When everyone is blue, it's the time to buy.
When the crowd's buying, it's the time to sell.
I know that, and everybody knows it.
But it's terribly hard to get people to put money into a deal, feeling as they do.
I'm sorry you have to work so hard, Jeffrey.
Oh, I didn't mean to talk about it.
I have a number of things on my mind, that's all.
Jones said you came in with someone?
Yes, Hardy Livingstone.
You know what I think of him.
Yes, I know, darling, but he happened to drop by the Bazaar, and asked if he could drive me home.
There's nothing wrong in that.
These bills came in today.
Darling, you must try to economize.
Just a little longer.
Any day now, this deal may come through, and then you can buy the whole city, if you like.
I don't mean to be extravagant, Jeffrey.
You just don't think, that's all.
Darling, nearly $1,000 there, just for clothes.
Heaven knows, I want to see you look lovely, but...
Oh, now don't be mad with me.
I love you so.
Yes, I know, but you can't ignore details.
Yet they tell us love is everything.
It isn't, is it?
You sound so hopeless.
Well, sometimes it seems that way.
Don't worry, we'll have it soon.
Well, let's not talk about it, darling.
Isn't there something gay we could do tonight?
Yes, let's go out for dinner.
Will you have dinner with me, Mrs. Carlyle?
I know, Jeffrey.
Let's go to that funny little speakeasy where you asked me to marry you.
Hold you in my dreams
I caught you. Oh.
Hello, Terrell.
Hey, waiter.
Always making love to his wife.
Of course, I don't blame him. Oh.
What's doing down at your end of the street?
Well, I'll tell you why I came over here.
Not to interrupt this love scene, but to let you in on something I just got a hold of that's hot.
United Copper.
I wouldn't tell you this if I didn't know.
You think you know, but...
In 24 hours, it's going to double in value.
Now I know you're all tied up in another proposition, but take my tip, raise a little money on the side and get into this thing. Mmm-mmm.
But, Jeffrey, if it's going to double...
Now, darling, you don't understand these things.
I've got a hunch.
You're always having hunches, dear.
That's the trouble with your husband, Elsa.
He's too conservative.
Jim Blake is a pal of mine, and his father-in-law runs the pool, and he tells me that inside of a week it will be up 100%.
Now take it or leave it.
If I do this, I don't want Jeffrey to know anything about it.
Well, you see, it's money I won at bridge.
In that case, I suppose...
Well, there's no reason why you should have to tell him, is there?
No, there really isn't.
After all, it's your business.
And you're absolutely certain that I can double my money?
That's my opinion.
I've put everything I own into it.
I want to invest $10,000.
I just deposited the money in the bank this morning.
I'll send you a check as soon as I get home.
Aren't you ready?
If you ask me, I think I look silly in this darn thing.
Darling, I think you look divine.
Why don't you tell me what you're going to wear?
Because I want to surprise you.
Now don't look.
Why, Elsa.
Why, those are real.
That must have cost a...
Where'd you get it?
It was loaned to me.
Livingstone? Mmm-hmm.
You don't mind, Jeffrey?
Oh, darling. Don't you want me to wear it?
Livingstone won't miss a chance like this.
He'll tell everyone.
What'll they think?
Ridiculous, Jeffrey.
Quite!
But the gossips won't think so.
Don't you see how it makes me look?
Like a fool!
I only wanted you to be proud of me.
Oh, go on. Wear it.
Oh, darling. You're so sweet.
And you will be proud of me when you see me in it.
You wait.
It's so beautiful.
Mr. Livingstone.
Mrs. Carlyle?
Who wants her?
Mrs. Carlyle, you are wanted on the telephone.
Phone?
Mrs. Carlyle?
I tried to get you at the house, they said you went to the Ball.
Mrs. Carlyle, listen, I...
What's that you're saying?
But you're joking.
But you said there wasn't a chance to lose. You...
You don't know what this means to me.
Hello? Hello?
You cut me off, Central...
Is it so terrible?
What'll happen to me?
I've got to have it.
I've got to have $10,000.
Can't your husband give it to you?
He hasn't got it, and he mustn't know, ever!
It wasn't mine.
It was the club's.
I can't stand the disgrace. I can't.
I've got to get it somehow.
I can let you have it.
I have the money, and naturally, it upsets me to see you like this.
Why, it's so simple.
I can let you have the money tonight.
Now, there's nothing to worry about.
I don't ask much in return, only that you be a little nicer to me.
Maybe some evening soon, you'll come to see me.
I'll be in the shoji room in half an hour.
Elsa, darling, I'm simply exhausted, so I'm leaving now.
But hasn't it really been a marvelous success?
My dear, we made $3,000 over our estimate.
I couldn't be more excited.
Oh, Elsa, you needn't bother about the money.
Oh. Needn't I?
No, because Mr. Durkin is going to take care of everything.
How will we get it to him?
Oh, I'll tell you.
I'll see you tomorrow at bridge, and then you can turn the funds over to me and I'll see that he gets it.
Oh, that will be fine, Louisa.
Well, I'll see you at 4:00, then.
All right. Good night, darling.
You've been with Livingstone all this time?
I was in there, Jeffrey.
This is so heavy.
Shall we go?
I'll get my things.
I think you'll find this all right, Louisa.
Yes, that agrees with my figures.
I went over it again last night.
Oh, thank you, darling, that's fine.
I'll turn it right over to Mr. Durkin, and the whole thing will be off our hands.
But I do think we've done splendidly, don't you?
I certainly do.
Best year we've ever had. Ooh!
Room full of beautiful women.
Hello, Jeffrey.
How do you do, Mrs. Albright?
Hello, Jeffrey.
Hello, Audrey.
Oh, here's my favorite man.
Mrs. Byron, how are you?
Tea, darling?
No thanks, dear.
Well, now that we've finished our business and caught a glimpse of the charming Mr. Carlyle, we really must go.
Don't hurry.
No, please, don't.
Oh, we must.
It's been lovely, Elsa.
And I'll see you Friday at Audrey's.
Goodbye, Jeffrey.
Goodbye, Elsa. Bye-bye.
I'll be seeing you on Friday.
Goodbye, all, then.
Jeffrey, what's the matter?
Jeffrey, darling, what're you doing?
Darling, we're rich.
Rich?
I put it over.
This morning I had practically nothing.
And now we're worth a million.
You understand, darling?
Oh, Jeffrey, are we really?
Oh, it's marvelous.
Now we'll take a trip this summer.
Anywhere you want to go.
Just to travel?
And not think about money.
We'll go to Europe, to France, the Italian Riviera.
Darling, just think of it!
New sights. New people.
It'll be wonderful.
Let's celebrate tonight, shall we?
You're going to wear these.
Oh, Jeffrey!
But they're the most lovely ones I've ever seen.
My pearls.
Yes. This is Mrs. Carlyle speaking.
I'm expecting you tonight.
Oh, but I can't. It's quite impossible.
Do you want me to come to your house after you and ask your husband's permission?
All right, I'll be there.
Yes. Yes, that's all right.
Oh, that was Mrs. Albright's secretary.
There's to be a meeting this evening.
You have to go to it?
Funny, Mrs. Albright didn't say anything about it when she was here.
Well, it came up quite unexpectedly.
I'm awfully sorry.
But it's frightfully important.
Jeffrey, if I wanted some money, a lot of it, right now,
could I have it?
Well, I need $10,000.
A gambling debt.
At the club?
A man came to me with your IOU today.
That was sweet of you, darling.
I owe $10,000 more.
$10,000 more?
I've got to have it right away.
Oh, Jeffrey...
Please don't be angry with me.
I know I was foolish.
It won't happen again I promise you.
Put it there.
I'm through with you for the evening.
I don't want to be disturbed.
I didn't expect you to come that way.
I didn't want to be seen.
Oh, you'll be here often.
I owe it to you.
I didn't lend you that money.
Yes, as part of a bargain.
This check cancels it.
Come now, Elsa.
We didn't make that kind of a bargain.
Oh, please, don't.
Can't you see that I don't want to stay?
You've changed since yesterday.
I do understand you, Elsa. Perfectly.
Better than you understand yourself.
You have money now, and I'm of no further use to you.
But if you're trying to appeal to my better nature, it's hopeless!
For I haven't any.
You made a promise, and you're going to keep it.
I'd rather kill myself.
Kill yourself?
I've dismissed the servants.
We're back a mile from the road.
Nobody will hear you.
Really, this is too absurd.
Why, we're both behaving outrageously.
You're not the kind of man...
You don't know what kind of man I am.
It means that because you made a promise, I was fool enough to think you were mine.
I even marked it as mine.
You want to go?
I'll let you go, but you'll carry my mark on you.
No, no, not yet. Not yet.
You cheat!
Now, show that to your husband.
The check...
I shot him.
Rhinelander 40154, please.
Racquet Club?
Has Mr. Carlyle come in yet?
Good morning, Mrs. Carlyle.
Good morning, Rita.
I heard you moving about so I brought your breakfast to you.
Has Mr. Carlyle come in yet?
Oh. Mrs. Carlyle?
Rita, take this away. Take it away!
Rita, get me something to wear.
Anything. Hurry up!
My dear, why did you let them do this?
There's so much for you to tell me, Elsa, so much.
There, that's all right.
I don't think it'll be necessary for you to have a nurse.
I'll drop in again this afternoon.
Then I heard a shot, almost as if someone else had fired, and he staggered and fell against the wall.
I ran away.
I came home and waited.
Waited all night.
In the morning, I saw the papers.
I knew what had happened.
And now I'm going to the police and confess.
No, no, you mustn't confess.
How else am I going to get you out of this?
You're not going to get...
But I am.
You don't think I'd let you...
Elsa, be quiet.
Oh, Jeffrey,
I've been thinking all night about myself, how wicked and selfish and spoiled I am.
And how good you are, and how little I deserve you.
I've got to tell the truth.
That's the least I can do.
You mustn't call me darling.
Yes, I must.
You are my darling.
I've brought you nothing but trouble.
No, dear.
Some trouble, but much happiness.
I'm a silly woman. Stupid and vain.
I didn't marry you because I thought you could spell or add, but because you're what you are.
I still love you, and want to protect you.
Jeffrey!
Why don't you hate me?
I could stand that better.
Don't say anything to anybody.
Don't even talk about the case.
Just leave it to me and to the lawyer.
But Jeffrey...
It'll be all right.
Livingstone isn't dead, and he isn't going to die.
He wants to drag us into court and make a scandal, but he can't do anything.
We have money now, and we can fight him.
I'll get off.
Suppose you don't.
But I will.
Suppose he should tell at the trial?
That wouldn't put him in a very good light.
He won't tell.
Promise me before I go. Promise me you won't talk.
You're sure it's all right?
Because I believe in you like God.
You wouldn't deceive me, now, would you?
No. Time's up.
And Jeffrey, listen, from now on I'm going to be different.
I am, truly.
I'm going to be good, I'm going to try and be worthy of you with all my heart.
I'll never deceive you again as long as I live.
I may do silly things, I suppose I will, but I'll always tell you.
Oh, I love you so.
Is Jeffrey safe? Is he all right?
I want you to tell me the truth.
It's impossible to know.
I can only tell you what I think.
Well?
I think we'll get your husband off without any trouble, but Livingstone's a tricky person.
It's not easy to anticipate just what move he'll make.
I'm sure he'll try to get back at you if he can.
Then there might be even prison.
Yes, there might, but I don't think so.
I wouldn't worry about it if I were you, Mrs. Carlyle.
You are in the employ of Mr. Livingstone?
I came to this country with Mr. Livingstone two years ago.
On the night Mr. Livingstone was shot, where were you?
I was in my room with the other two servants.
What did you do when you heard the shot?
Well, first I didn't know what to do, because Mr. Livingstone said he did not wish to be disturbed.
So, you see, I was afraid to go down.
Then we made up our minds to find out what had happened, and ran downstairs.
What did you find there?
I saw Mr. Livingstone lying wounded on the floor, and Mr. Carlyle was standing there with a gun in his hand.
You mean the defendant there?
What did you say to Mr. Carlyle?
I said to Mr. Carlyle, "Who did it?"
And how did he answer you?
He said, "I shot him. "
Mr. Livingstone, tell the court in your own way what happened on the night you were shot.
Well, I'm afraid I'll have to go back a few days before that, to the occasion of a gambling debt.
A little game with Mr. Carlyle.
Jeffrey? Shh.
Mr. Carlyle had lost to me considerably at cards, to be exact, $10,000.
He explained he was in financial difficulties and asked if I'd take his IOU, which I did.
A few days later, I needed money, and I telephoned Mr. Carlyle and reminded him of his IOU.
He promised to bring the money that evening.
When he came, I noticed that he'd been drinking.
He seemed in a rather reckless mood.
He handed me the check for the amount.
Exhibit 32-A, please.
Is that the check, Mr. Livingstone?
Then he suggested that we play a game for the check.
If he lost, he owed me double.
If he won, he kept the check.
As I went to a table drawer to get some cards, Oh... it happens that I keep a pistol in the same drawer...
Jeffrey, I can't stand this.
Remember your promise.
Mr. Carlyle caught sight of the gun.
We started playing. Well...
Go on, Mr. Livingstone.
Well, to put it bluntly, he cheated.
Cheated!
Order!
I won't let him say that about you!
Please, Mrs. Carlyle, please...
Continue, Mr. Livingstone.
Naturally, I was angry. I...
I threatened to expose him, have him put out of the club.
Before I knew it, he rushed to the table drawer and opened it.
I made a lunge for the pistol, but he got there first and he fired.
May it please the Court, I should like to reserve the right to cross-examine this witness later on, if the prosecutor has no objection.
No objection.
The State rests, Your Honor.
Your Honor, gentlemen of the jury,
I'm going to reverse the general order of things a bit, and first ask the defendant to tell you his story in a simple and straightforward manner.
Mr. Carlyle.
Jeffrey, you've got to let me tell them the truth.
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?
Now, Mr. Carlyle, will you please tell the jury your story?
But, Mr. Carlyle, you...
I corroborate absolutely Mr. Livingstone's testimony.
Elsa!
He didn't do it, I did it.
You must listen to me.
I object.
You've got to hear me, all of you.
I shot him!
My husband took the blame to save me.
He wouldn't let me tell the truth because of the scandal.
But I can't go through with this.
He's innocent.
I gambled money that wasn't mine and lost.
I didn't know what to do, I was desperate.
I couldn't tell my husband.
Then he... He offered me the money.
I knew what he wanted.
I'm not trying to make excuses for myself.
There aren't any.
But I was crazy.
I was so frightened that I'd be found out.
Then my husband gave me a check and I went to Livingstone to pay him back, but he wouldn't take the money.
He wanted me, he was insane.
He tried to force me to stay with him. And when I wouldn't...
And when I wouldn't, he did this to me.
He did this to me!
He branded me!
He branded me and I shot him!
I shot him and I'm glad.
I'm glad!
Get Livingstone!
I'm glad...
Gentlemen, take your places.
Your Honor, I move the indictment be dismissed.
The indictment is dismissed.
Stand up, Mr. Carlyle.
Darling, it's over.
You must think of it as a bad dream.
Now you're awake.
Yes, that's it.
Well, now that we're beginning again, Mrs. Carlyle, don't you think I ought to propose to you?
Well, how about it?
Darling, this is a dream, a beautiful one.
No, this time it's real.
More real than before?
You bet.
No betting.
Nothing but double solitaire.
Plenty of room for them.
- Cut that out, Kid, and get out.
Hey, isn't that young Mr. Cravat, there?
By golly, it is.
I know what will fetch him.
Watch his ears perk up when he hears the old Travelers.
Let's give it to him.
High rickety!
Well, you old...
Hello, buddy.
Old Buck.
Well, hate to be making it into a firefight.
If it ain't the old honker, himself.
Got yourself hitched?
Yeah, I've got a wife and son, four years old now.
Aye, this is like a Fourth of July celebration on Judgment Day.
- Beats all Creation.
- Say, where are you heading for, Yancey?
- I'm cutting dirt for the Little Bear Creek.
- That's the spot, believe me.
Yes, indeed.
You're Yancey Cravat, aren't you?
- Lee, Dixie Lee.
- Going for a town site?
No, I'm going for a quarter-section ranch out at the Little Bear Creek.
That's funny, I'm heading for Little Bear, too.
Well, I know just the piece of land I want.
It's deep in the gully and a lot of scrub over.
Ready, aim...
- You near flummoxed.
But his legs are broken.
I heard them crack.
Please shoot him.
And in no time, no time, mind you... they'd snapped up every piece of land that was worth having... and by nightfall... By nightfall there wasn't an acre.
Think of it, Louis, not an acre left out of that two million.
The only spot I wanted was the ground we stood on, and...
Well, the girl got that quarter section.
Yancey Cravat... you let that hussy in black tights have your claim... after having been gone a whole month, away from your wife and child.
- Now, Mama...
- Don't you "Mama" me.
Isaiah, go on with your fanning.
Yes, Mrs. Venable.
- The land was hers by right of claim.
I don't believe a word of it.
Why did you let her keep your land?
Lt'd been a man, I could have shot him.
You can't shoot a woman.
- Oh, Felice.
I don't suppose you'd recognize the lady without her black tights.
"Let there be no strife between thee and me."
That's from the Old Testament, Dabney.
You may not recognize that.
It's all tommyrot.
Don't you realize that this is a new empire?
Why, folks, there's never been anything like it since Creation.
Creation?
That took six days, this was done in one.
History made in an hour.
Why, it's like a miracle out of the Old Testament.
- Don't be blasphemous, Yancey.
- Like a miracle out of the Old Testament.
Cities of ten thousands, springing up overnight.
Well, I'm going back.
I'm going back and help build a new state out of the last frontier of the nation... and it'll be a state someday, mark my words.
Yancey, you're not leaving me again?
Leaving you, my beauty?
Not by a long shot, sugar.
This time you and Cim are coming with me.
Louis Venable, can you sit there and see your daughter dragged off... to be scalped among savages?
- But I want to go, Mama.
- You don't know what you want.
We start Monday week, fresh and fair, with two freighters.
One with a printing outfit and the other with the household goods.
- Why, we can make it in nine days.
- I forbid it.
You're going to stay here with your father and mother in decent civilization.
- I'm going with him, Mother.
That's it, honey.
Why, we've had enough of this Wichita.
We're going out to a brand new two-fisted, rip snorting country... full of Indians, rattlesnakes, gun- toters, and desperados.
- Isaiah, I declare.
- Miserable brat, you Boon boy.
Master Yancey.
Take me with you to Oklahomy.
Please take me, Master Yancey.
You ain't going to no Oklahomy.
You're going to take a bath.
- Mammy, I want to...
- Get out. Get out.
Well, I'll go see about those freighters, huh?
Come on here, Cim.
Atta boy.
My son, you're going to see more Indians then you ever thought of.
I never heard of such a thing.
What do you mean, Sabra?
Why a Venable should ever marry such a man, a buffalo hunter.
A quart of whiskey a day, living in that dreadful Cimarron country.
- What is Cimarron?
- Savage, Cousin Hewitt.
It means wild, unruly.
Yancey's idea of a name for the boy, Cim.
You don't like anything Yancey does.
You never have.
And that newspaper of his, Wichita Wigwam.
Editorials about Indian's rights.
You might think Yancey was an Indian himself.
Some half-breeds are no darker.
- Don't you dare say that.
- I heard he killed a man.
I won't listen to you any longer.
I don't care about Yancey's past.
I married him because I loved him, and I'm going with him.
- Sabra.
- I never heard of such a thing.
Yancey, where's that iron skillet?
I can't find it anywhere.
- Right here, sugar, with the stove.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Cim, honey, get up off the ground.
It's too damp.
You know, I think we ought to get out that old rag rug... and put it down here for supper.
Right you are, honey.
I think Aunt Cassandra must have put the andirons in here, sugar.
- High rickety!
- Isaiah!
Please let me stay, Master Yancey, Miss Sabra.
I'll help, I'll work, I'll do everything.
I'll help you in Oklahomy.
Well, you're here, I reckon you can stay, Isaiah.
I hope you go to heaven when you die.
Let me do that cooking, Miss Sabra.
I'll fix them.
Yeah, you start right in by getting some wood.
- Now, scoot.
- I'm scooting.
There's loyalty, Sabra, that money can't buy.
We're going into new things, pet.
A new empire... and I want to help build it for you.
And we'll have just the prettiest little house we can find, too.
- With flowers and things.
- With flowers and trees... and morning glories growing all over.
It'll be our first real home, alone... and I want you to be happy all the way, sugar.
Our first real home... alone.
Hold that iron.
I ain't aiming to check you through.
All I want is your ready money.
This is the first time I ever fronted your iron, Kid.
- Well, if it ain't Yancey.
- I'm sorry I disturbed you folks.
- Howdy, ma'am.
- My son's inside, asleep.
I'm heading for Osage, aiming to make it my home.
Osage, huh?
- Gonna start your newspaper there?
- Got to be loping.
- Need you hurry away like this, Kid?
I got overdrawn at the bank at Red Fork and they're looking for me.
Luck to you.
- Stay away from Osage, will you, Kid?
Unless you send me an invite.
Cut dirt!
It's a poser, honey.
All this in six weeks right up from the raw prairie.
Next time you come here, Chief, you go through the roof.
Esteban Miro, a half-breed and a bad one.
I didn't think he had the brash.
Must have some friends around town.
Don't you worry, honey.
Look, sugar, they've named the streets already.
Pawhuska Avenue, that's an Indian name, son.
Paw-hu means hair and ska means white.
White hair.
Pawhuska was an old Osage chief.
- I'm an Indian, old White Hair. - Cim.
Lots of watermelons there, Isaiah.
I sure glad I came to Oklahomy.
- I'll appeal to the highest court.
- You're a sooner.
- Don't you call me...
Step right inside.
We'll determine the status of this case.
I don't let anybody call me a sooner.
- By the way, have you each $10 with you?
- Yes, we have.
Step right inside, men, and tell us all about it.
All right. I want to know who...
Plenty of law practice.
Three or four claimers for some of these lots.
Look, folks working late.
Plenty of good water...
Now, lady, what can I do for you?
There's Louis Hefner's emporium.
I saw old Louis stake that claim.
Furniture in an undertaking parlor?
They have plenty of combination stores out here until the town gets larger.
If you've a mind, you can fly out of there, Elmer.
Hold it there, partner.
Hold her, don't let her buck you down.
Get away from that weeping thing.
- Why don't you do something?
- I'm doing all I can, honey.
Old Elmer's been uncorking the red eye, I see.
Yancey, do get out of here so we can find a place to sleep.
I'm nearly dead and so is Cim.
Say, where's the Bixby Hotel?
You just passed it on the other corner.
Honey, we passed right by it.
Get along.
See you later, folks.
Come on here, boy.
I won't bring up my boy in a town like this.
I'm going back home.
Well, don't you think you better wait until morning, honey?
You know, a good night's sleep... and things are gonna look entirely different.
Louis Hefner, one of the town's leading merchants now, I gather.
- Hello, Yance.
I'm glad to see you here.
- I'm glad to be here.
I trust the furniture end of the business is doing better than the other.
Yeah. Only been three killings so far... but we'll have to start a full jail pretty soon, I guess.
- You're gambling?
Just watching where the money goes.
Yancey!
Yancey Cravat!
- Old Grat!
Yancey Cravat.
Why, you old letch monger.
You are still wearing that white hat.
And you're still making lightning calculations.
- You know the boys.
Esteban Miro.
So, you're Cravat, huh?
Yeah, and you?
Yountis, Lon Yountis.
Gents, what are you going to have?
I'll have brandy.
- Are you going to start the newspaper?
- Yeah, Grat.
I understand the former editor here, a man named Paigler, died.
Was shot in the back, huh?
What are you aiming at?
Mr. Cravat, I'd like to talk to you a minute, if you have time.
You see, I'm a printer and a darn good one.
And you see, I heard you were gonna open up a newspaper office called... The Oklahoma Wigwam, see.
And I'd like to have...
Well, I'd like to go to work.
- Howdy, Yance.
- Howdy, Bull.
"...saffron-robed, arose from the ocean...
- "to bring light to gods and men."
- Ocean?
Yarns and laces, celluloid collars... knotting yarn, drawstrings, shoestrings, suspenders.
- Have you any fancy braids?
- Yes, ma'am, I have some fancy braids.
That's Sol Levy, a walking notion counter.
...suspenders, darning yarn, celluloid collars...
Howdy, Sol.
Howdy, Mr. Cravat.
Yes, ma'am, here's some drawstrings fancy braid and I'll give you a real good bargain.
I never saw anything like it in my life.
I'm afraid they think my dress is a little too elaborate.
Why, Milton would have no words for such beauty.
Howdy, Cim.
He called you Cim.
- The boys are up to something.
I can't say for sure, but I think they're the ones that did Paigler dirt.
Paigler? Who's that?
Isn't that the editor?
The one who was found shot dead?
- You mean they did it?
- I don't say they did it, exactly.
They know more than is comfortable.
Still wearing that white hat, huh?
That's Lon Yountis.
Nothing to be alarmed about.
Don't be frightened, honey.
The dirty scum.
Get out of here.
Half-circle cut.
You'll find that's the Cravat brand.
- Can't you take a joke, Yancey?
- Joke, nothing.
- Lf your missus wasn't with you.
- Don't you "missus" me... you dirty scum.
You're a lot of good for nothing louses, that's what you are.
Shooting at people in the street.
You leave my husband alone.
- I declare, I've a notion to...
Sabra.
Why, it'll be all over the Southwest... that Yancey Cravat was hiding behind a woman's petticoat.
They can't say so.
You shot him very nicely in the ear, darling.
Well, you shouldn't interfere when men are having a little friendly shooting.
Friendly?
A bullet within an inch of your head?
He knew where it was going.
Well, come on, sugar.
I think we better find that house we're gonna live in, don't you?
Down a little.
Now a little more.
Hold!
Just nail it.
I'll bushwhack her.
- Well, honey, we're here.
- Yes, we're here.
We're getting started, too.
You know, when I think of those five years in Wichita...
- I thought you liked it in Wichita.
- A prison cell, my pet.
Five years in one place, that's the longest stretch I've ever done.
Back and forth like a trail horse.
House, office, Venables, vegetables.
A little while, I'd have turned into either a Venable or a vegetable, one or the other.
We better get this office and print shop settled... if you're ever gonna get out an issue of that newspaper.
I guess Rickey can attend to it.
He's a printer and a darn good one.
I gotta see about these real-estate transfers... and write up some editorials and news... and we got a clue to the Paigler killer last night.
- I wanna follow it up.
- I wish you wouldn't.
If I can find out who killed Paigler... I'm gonna print it in the first edition of the Oklahoma Wigwam.
Well, did you see the...
Well, we got the shingle hung out all right, Mrs. Cravat.
- Look fine, Miss Sabra.
- Come on, now, colored boy.
We'd better pitch in and unsnarl things.
Never mind, Rickey. I'll straighten this room.
- You go on into the print shop with Isaiah.
Well, we'll unmantle the printing press... and dust off the adjectives.
Look, Mama, see what an Indian just gave me.
Cim, how many times have I told you not to talk to those dirty, filthy Indians?
Here, take this into the kitchen.
Don't drop it, and come back and help Mother.
Safety pins, collar buttons... needles, thread, thimbles, crochet cotton... celluloid collars, safety pins, crochet cotton, needles.
Here comes that little shrimp again.
Let's see how he feels today.
I wanna buy a little fancy lace!
...cotton, needles, thread...
Come on, Sol, I wanna buy my gal a bustle.
- How much for a bustle cover?
- Bring me a pair of tights.
Safety pins, cotton gloves, needles.
Please, don't start, please.
Please don't, mister.
Please, mister. Please, don't.
- Bring him here.
- Please. Please. Please don't.
- Well, howdy, Mr. Levy.
- Please don't do it, mister.
- Please, mister, don't... - That's all right.
That's all right.
- Let's you and me have a drink.
Please don't do it, mister.
I don't want any. Thanks.
Be a real pal and have a drink.
- What do you think about...
- Where you going, there?
Where you going, there?
Come here, you little runt, and have a...
Come up here.
When I tell them to take a drink, they drink, don't they?
Well, they better.
You're a rough, eh, Yountis?
Just whip your weight on wildcats, huh?
Who asked you?
Come on, Sol.
You're all right, huh?
That's their idea of a joke.
You go ahead about your business.
- They won't be bothering you none, now.
- Thanks, Mr. Cravat.
Threatening to make Osage the terror of the Southwest... as in the old days of the Cimarron, huh?
- Now, you as the editor...
- Yeah, me as editor... I'm interviewing citizens of note regarding their sentiments.
- What's yours?
- Stick to your lawn.
Come on, Yountis.
You know what I'm aiming at.
Who killed Paigler?
I'm advising you to keep your mouth shut.
Or the next time, it won't be your sombrero.
Thanks for the sentiment.
Mine is...
Cherokee death cry.
Means, you or him.
The second button on his coat is about the spot for his wishbone... maybe a couple of inches higher.
Get your real-estate papers filed all right?
Yancey, dear.
You're not going to bother anymore about that Paigler man, are you?
Don't you be worrying your pretty head about that.
Maybe he did shoot himself.
Besides, you've got Cim and me to think of.
Paigler was shot in the back trying to do what I want to do:
Make a model empire out of this new Oklahoma country.
No, sir, I'll show them first crack.
The Oklahoma Wigwam prints all the news, all the time... knowing no law except the law of God... and the government of these United States.
Say, that's a pretty good slogan.
Top of the page, just ahead of the editorial column.
Yancey, let them alone.
I don't want you to be killed.
- I don't. - Honey...
I'm gonna clean up the Paigler killing, or I won't be alive myself.
You don't wanna lose me just yet, do you?
No, dearest.
- Howdy, ma'am.
Yancey, our womenfolk think it's about time... that some contact be established between the town and Providence.
There ain't a minister here, and we've come to ask you... to conduct divine service next Sunday.
Divine service?
I'll be pleased to.
- Then that's settled.
- We'll have to arrange a place.
Well, let's see, there's Grat Gotch's.
- The gambling tent?
- It's the only place in town big enough.
Yeah, I know Grat well.
Back soon, honey.
Good morning, Mr. Cravat.
Do you feel nervous about your sermon, dear?
I'd rather plead to a Texas jury than preach to this gang of...
What's everybody laughing at?
- Isaiah.
- Can't you understand?
I didn't go to fret nobody.
You all dress up fine for a church's meeting... so I pleased to dress myself up Sunday style.
That's right, Isaiah.
We take it as a personal compliment.
- Why, you look finer than any of us.
- I just fixed my twily like you all.
Say, Isaiah, would you like to have a real suit of Sunday clothes?
A Sunday suit for me to wear?
For true?
I don't want you to go to that church meeting.
Oh, now, now.
Now, listen close.
I want you to do something important for me.
Now, the house is all alone, see.
I want you to go down there and keep watch... till we come home from that church meeting.
Patrol duty. That's what.
Patrol duty?
Yes, sir, Master Yancey.
Now you take this and if anyone tries to break in, shoot.
- I'll kill them dead.
And then you get a new suit and boots, besides.
Now, scoot.
I'm scooting.
Do you think...
Yancey, let's not go.
Tell them you're sick or I'm sick.
Tell them anything...
We're late, honey.
Hi, Yance.
Hiya, preacher man.
Now, Preacher, where's your Bible?
Right here, boys.
Now no loafing in the entrance.
Either come in or stay out.
Did you see that man, Yountis?
He looked at you so...
That's fine, honey.
I always like to have the members of my flock right under my eye.
Quite a shindig, ain't it?
Some of these folks look as queer in church as a mule does in the front... parlor.
How do, Mrs. Cravat?
I'm Mrs. Tracy Wyatt.
It was so nice of your husband to conduct this service this morning.
About time the intellectual life of this community was stirred up a bit.
I was a schoolteacher back East, that is in Cairo, Illinois.
I can trace my ancestry right back to William Whipple... one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.
Lands, yes.
Some pumpkins.
I'll say. Hey, Annie.
- Dixie Lee, just arrived in town.
- Dixie Lee?
Why, I thought you'd heard of her.
Why, she's a...
Right here, sister.
Take my pew.
Get up, webfoot, and give the gals a seat.
Rest the velvet, lady.
Look out for them splinters.
Take off your hat.
- Ain't she a huckleberry?
- Lollapalooza, field up, pert and chipper.
Red Fork.
Is it all right if I'm here?
You can stay here just as long as I do.
Fellow citizens... I have been called upon to conduct this opening meeting... of the Osage first Methodist... Episcopalian, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptist, Catholic...
During the course of my career as lawyer and editor... I've been required to speak on various occasions on many subjects.
I've spoken in defense of my country and in criticism of it.
I've been called upon to defend and convict... horse thieves, harlots, and murderers.
For any shelter, however humble or however sordid... no offense, Grat... becomes, when His word is spoken in it... His temple.
Therefore, let us open this auspicious occasion by singing...
What do you know, boys, anyway, huh?
How about...
Who Are You At Home, for a starter?
Thanks, Rickey.
It's a good song, though a bit secular.
But you all know it.
While we are singing, we'll take up a collection.
Great guns, Yancey.
We ain't even got a church.
Now, that's all right, Pete.
Indians not included.
All right, Jesse, will you please favor us with a pitch?
Will the ladies please join in with their sweet soprano voices?
Now, once again, please.
Fellow citizens... the sum of the collection for the organ for the first Osage church... whose denomination shall be nameless, is a gratifying total... of $133 and 55 cents.
Wait a minute, Grat, did you say 55 cents?
That's right, Yancey.
Some miserable, tightfisted, skinflint of a...
Well, maybe it is an Osage by mistake.
How about a Cherokee, Yancey?
Not a Cherokee, Sid.
I recognized your voice by the squeak.
Friends, we've come to the sermon.
Anyone wishing to leave, kindly do so now.
Please make way for all departing worshippers.
My text is from Proverbs.
"A lion is in the way.
There's a lion in the streets."
Friends, there's a lion in the streets of Osage.
I have gone about seeking information of this lion.
I might say this jackal or dirty skunk... if it wouldn't be sacrilegious.
But this jackal in a lion's skin... who by threatening sudden death... has held this little town abjectly terrorized.
Friends, and fellow citizens... I repent of my greed... and my desire for self-advancement at the expense of this community.
I no longer intend to withhold the name of that yellow, skunking murderer... who shot down Jack Paigler when his back was turned.
I will tell you all now the name of that...
Was Lon Yountis.
Louis Hefner... as coroner, do your official duty and remove the body.
Okay, Yance.
It's self-defense and justifiable homicide.
This town needs a boot hill, and I'll start it with this burial.
Fellow citizens... under the circumstances... we will forego this sermon... and conclude this service with a brief word of prayer.
Bless this community, O Lord.
I swan... that's the most surprising church meeting I ever attended.
But I must say, your husband did the proper thing.
The cleaning out of that gang is one of the first moves... to make this town fit to live in.
Thanks to you, Yancey.
- Horrible, he might've...
- But he didn't, honey.
- Did you have to kill him like that?
- No, I could've let him kill me.
Congratulations, Mr. Cravat.
Haven't seen you since the run.
Well, how do you do Miss...
No wonder.
- I heard you were in town.
- You've known.
Yes, I'm here.
Thought you'd settle down on that quarter section that I didn't get.
Well, I tried to be a farmer, but I had to give up the land.
The neighbors' wives formed a vigilance committee, and I left by request.
A vigilance committee would.
You haven't said a word all the way home, pet.
What's stirring you?
That woman, smirking and smiling.
And you stood there actually talking to her, holding her hand... after she'd stolen your land in the run, too.
She wanted that land because she was trying to give up her way of living...
- was desperate.
- Well, what's she doing here, then?
Driven out by the neighbors... she heard the railroad was coming through and came down here.
You talk as though you know a lot about her.
Comes from a good family, victim of circumstances.
Well, in a way, she's a good girl.
A good girl?
I know a lot of people scattered over Oklahoma... that shouldn't cast a stone at her.
Don't you quote your Bibles and Magdalenes at me, Yancey Cravat!
First anniversary numbers.
Say, you've been meaning to pull some blood for a year. Why don't you subscribe?
Well, it cost $1.
Cravat could use that dollar to buy the new baby a rattle.
And a pair of rubber boots till the streets get paved.
You sure need rubber boots here, or go barefoot.
I got to get a pair of new boots...
Darling, she's awake.
Hello, baby Donna.
Look, this is Daddy.
This is Mama, much more important to you just now.
Yancey, darling, I'm so happy.
I'm highfaluting myself, sugar, smiling as a basket of chips.
I'm gonna do so many things.
Build a porch for Donna.
Start a woman's club, a real one.
Make this town better for Donna to live in.
No saloons.
No women like Dixie Lee.
And I'm gonna have a hired girl as soon as the newspaper...
Yeah, all those things, sugar, but you mustn't try too much.
The garden looks fine, Miss Sabra, and them morning glories sure is climbing.
Thank you, Isaiah.
Look, she know me.
Who you rolling your eyes at and making faces?
Just wait until you get a little more bigger.
I've got a lot of things I is gonna teach you.
I brought you some of the nicest chicken broth, made it myself.
Old family recipe.
You must take some between meals to keep your strength up.
Thank you, Mrs. Wyatt.
- How is the little darling?
- Simply blooming.
I do want to congratulate you on the first anniversary of the newspaper.
"In youth and beauty, wisdom is so rare."
That reminds me, your idea of the new club.
- We must take up literature, too.
- Yes, and maybe early American history.
Why, honey, don't you know you're making it?
Wallpaper!
Why, it's the first in town.
- In Mr. Hefner's store.
- I had him send East for it.
- Has he got any left?
I think he got several patterns.
It's a new department.
Do tell.
Well, I must be going.
Goodbye, Donna.
I reckon Louis Hefner's gonna have a run on wallpaper soon.
I want to get a nice little dainty rosebud pattern... for Donna's new bedroom.
Should we get a new house, too?
Sugar, you are getting ambitious.
I can't tell you half the things I'm thinking.
Yancey, I feel so light...
- so queer.
I think I'm going to...
- Sugar.
The chief has been saying they're shooting up the bank.
Kid!
That's Cravat.
Dang it!
I didn't figure on him.
Take care of Sabra... and keep everybody away from those windows.
- What's going on? - Keep back.
It's all right.
Just keep back.
Yancey's out there, and I can't do anything.
Where's Cim?
Cim!
I'll find him, Miss Sabra.
No, Isaiah!
Hold tight!
You pegged me.
I never figured we'd end up on the opposite sides of the fence, Kid.
My fault, Yance.
Didn't have an invite.
You can blow me to a pine box, if you want to.
Sure, old Kid.
And I'll owe you for it.
- Pegged you in the arm, eh?
- Strangle the whole bunch!
Say, you're a foreigner!
All right, we'll pick them up and put them in the front window.
Yancey, that's the highest price shooting ever done in this community... with all the rewards out for The Kid.
Bankers Association pays $10,000 cash, alone.
Wells Fargo, $5,000.
And the railroads of Santa Fe and County, $5,000 each.
- And you'll get it all, Yancey.
- More than $30,000.
And the government's price on The Kid's head.
- You'll hear from Washington.
- Old Ben Harrison'll be tickled pink... for getting rid of the last real bandit of the country.
I wouldn't be surprised if they appoint you governor of the territory.
I'll send that bandit to you, Yance.
Cim.
Don't you worry about it, sugar.
Doctor Valien'll be right over.
I'm so grateful it isn't worse.
The whole town's so proud of what you've done... getting rid of those bandits and outlaws.
Just think, all that money.
Cim's education, Donna can go East to school.
We'll have a new printing press.
I'll send back the rewards, every dollar.
You'll send them back?
I knew The Kid when he was riding the open range... making honest money.
I've rode with him.
I've slept in the prairie beside him.
Why, one of his bullets might've hit you, or Cim, or Donna.
That's why I killed The Kid... not for money.
What's the matter with Isaiah, Mama?
Well, old Grover's finally woke up to what we need out here.
It's the greatest thing that ever happened to the territory.
Why, folks'll flock in from all over the country.
Hey, it'll be a bigger rush than we had here in '89.
Bigger?
I should say so.
Why they'll add six million acres to our two.
Great chance for a man to make a fortune out there.
Another four weeks, eh?
September 16?
That's what the telegram says, boys.
A new run!
The biggest thing yet!
Three times more land than in '89.
- What a chance.
- What a chance for a man!
Say, how about you, Yancey?
- You wouldn't miss this, would you?
- I can't boys.
- Come on, Yancey.
- Yeah, come on, Yancey.
I'll be getting you a horse, Yancey.
Hey, Yancey!
Pull in the books with the big figures.
We'll be looking for you.
I'm gonna sell out everything I got... and head for that Cherokee land.
Well, I would, too, but I don't think the foot will hold.
Headline for the Cherokee article, Jess...
- and lock her up.
- Well, my crackers!
This extra will be sold out before 10 minutes.
You know, every...
I think that was the nicest club meeting we've ever had.
Your speech was so interesting, Mrs. Cravat.
Don't forget the next meeting is at my house.
- Election for president.
See you Saturday at the croquet tournament.
- Cim, dear, look out for Donna.
- All right, Mama.
She would be the first in town to have balloon sleeves.
I never...
- Why don't you fix that?
- We are fixing it.
What, with cracks to fall through?
You know, I understand balloon sleeves were all the style... at the Chicago World's Fair.
Do tell.
- Why, it's Betsy Levitt.
- Did you ever?
See, now, here's a piece of candy for you.
- I don't want... - Don't you want it?
Oh, yes.
- Take your hands off that child.
- Come here, Betsy.
Tell, dear.
You try any of your kidnapping tricks, you'll suffer for it.
- Why I...
- You vicious hussy.
You're not fit to touch a child.
Come, Mrs. Sessy.
I suppose I should've let her lie there in the mud and cry.
...and how they applauded when I said:
"Oklahoma has made its history overnight.
"Like a miracle out of the Old Testament."
You're right, dear.
I do like it here.
I'm so glad we came away from Wichita.
And you should've seen them open their eyes at this.
- What do you think of it?
- Cruelty to animals.
It's the very latest thing from Chicago.
Some old squaw sees some of that, and she'll want to buy a pair... and put a papoose in each sleeve.
Cousin Della writes they'll be even fuller by autumn.
By autumn?
- What's in the telegram?
- News, sugar.
President Cleveland has set a date for the opening of the Cherokee strip.
The Cherokee land?
The government's bought it from the Indians for the huge sum... of $1.40 an acre.
- Pushing them further back.
- Well, it's a good thing.
They made no use of it, anyhow.
Dirty, filthy, good for nothing, low...
Let's go, Sabra.
Let's go for an allotment of that Cherokee land.
This is the biggest thing in the history of Oklahoma.
- Leave here?
- Sell out the paper, at a profit...
- and go for a town site this time.
- Give up all we've worked and slaved for?
We gave up Wichita, and advice, and Southern fried chicken.
Let's get out of all this.
Was Mother right when she said you'd go for the adventure of it.
The longest time you've ever stayed in one place.
You've been here only four.
Well, don't you realize, sugar?
This is a new empire.
Why, we'll see it grow before our very eyes into a new state.
We can't tear up our lives and start over again.
- Let the others go.
Honey, this is a chance of a lifetime.
Let's not talk any more about it.
Yancey, you don't mean...
Sugar, if we all took root and squatted, there'd never be any new country.
We got a horse for you, Yancey.
You're not going now, today?
- You can't go like this.
Sugar, come on and go with me.
- But Cim, Donna...
- The children, too.
All of us, now.
- We'll get out the old crate, huh?
All right, Sabra.
I'll send back for you, sugar.
I'll send back for you.
Step right up to the middle of this horse there, Yancey.
That makes it up faster, Yance.
I'll send back for you, sugar.
Is Daddy going on the run, Mama?
I'll bet you that'll make them remember the Maine.
The way those Rough Riders rode over San Juan Hill... showed those Spaniards something.
I'll bet you Cuba'll never be able to govern herself.
Now, I'm predicting in five years she'll sign.
Did you hear anything about Yancey being in Cuba?
Yancey?
You're always hearing something about him being somewhere.
Now, I heard that...
Fella told me he was over at Cherokee strip living with a squaw.
Someone said he's over at the Kickapoo land opening, sold out for big money.
I heard he was in Amarillo.
Drunk a quart of whiskey in a day and died.
Suppose it's true about Yancey and Dixie Lee... that he sent her the money to build that brick house?
Folks that use up air for that kind of talk have one-chambered minds... and mighty small caliber.
- Old boy's kind of touchy today.
Hey, that Dixie Lee case comes up this afternoon, don't it?
- Old Charlie Flash is on the jury.
Sure hope he's sober.
These are all right and corrected, Rickey.
- But I want a reprint on this one.
- But how about the boilerplates?
- No, we won't have room.
The Dixie Lee story will carry over to the second page.
- So, they let her out on bail yesterday?
- Well, they wouldn't if I had my way.
Don't you think that you're being a little too severe on Dixie Lee...
- putting her in jail?
- No... and I'll show her something before I'm through.
- Well, that's for you.
- Now, I don't mean to be abrupt.
My ad looks good, even if I did write it myself.
I brought the check.
Now, you're paying this today just to help me.
See, I get my money's worth.
Everybody reads the paper since you made it a daily.
- It's doing fine, huh?
If people would only pay the bills in cash, instead of in trade.
Look what I get in trade at the store.
A man comes in, buys a pair of pants, some stockings... a piece of calico and gives me a bear cub.
What should I do with a bear cub? Eat it?
Oh, well, someday... you and I will look back on this and we will laugh.
How do you mean, laugh?
Not very loud.
I mean, when I'm rich and you're famous... and the Oklahoma Wigwam is a great newspaper.
Yancey Cravat, proprietor and editor.
You never change it, do you?
They will always talk about Yancey.
He's gonna be part of the history of the great Southwest.
It's men like him that build the world.
The rest of them, like me, well, we just come along and live in it.
Well, I must be getting back to the store... before a customer brings in a coyote and bites the clerk.
- Did you fix the salad like I told you, Ruby?
Cim?
- Come, dears.
Hi, Ruby!
Cim, dear, what comes first?
We thank thee for thy blessings, O God... and pray that thou wilt watch over us all while we are separated.
Spare our dear one... and bring us all together again... in safety and happiness.
- What is going on here?
Hey, it's Yancey!
Isn't that Daddy?
Sabra, honey.
You've been fighting?
Howdy, Rickey.
Cim and Donna.
- Son and daughter.
Your daughter is a Venable, Mrs. Cravat.
And the son, here... well... he hasn't decided yet, huh?
- Have you got a pony?
- No, but I'd like one.
- Then I'll buy you a pinto this afternoon.
Wife and mother.
Oh, sugar.
Sugar, how I missed you.
- Yancey, the children.
Darling, you can't come home like this after years...
- "Penelope."
"Strange lady, standing thus aloof...
"thy husband hath come home to thee."
- You and your miserable Milton.
- Who's this?
Don't you remember Ruby Big Elk?
Why, hello, Ruby.
He is very well, sir.
My, oh, my!
- Well, I couldn't quite run the paper... and take care of the children, and do the housework, too... so I hired a cheap servant.
Run along to school now, children.
You're going to be late.
- Don't forget my pony.
- I won't forget it.
- How are you, Mrs. Wyatt?
Well, I...
If it isn't Mr. Cravat.
- I heard you were back.
- Gracious lady.
The years touch thee but lightly.
- Your husband's looking better than ever.
- Yes, I think so, too.
Mr. Cravat, could I see you a minute?
Will you ladies forgive me?
Quite a surprise.
But of course, you're going to court?
I most certainly am.
I'll be with you in just one moment.
- This is to be a great day for Osage.
- Yes, indeed.
Not more than two.
Well, maybe three fingers.
Dixie Lee sentenced to...
When did all this happen?
It didn't yet, but it will at 2:00 this afternoon.
- What will?
Trial?
Yes, Yancey?
- Why, what is it?
- What's all this about Dixie Lee?
I'm on my way to court now.
The charge is public nuisance.
- Prosecuting?
- Pat Leary.
- Who's defending her?
- Nobody in town would touch the case.
The Judge will probably appoint someone as a formality.
- To court.
You can't take the case of that woman.
You'd come back and take that creature's part... against every respectable woman in Osage?
Anyone, no matter who, has a legal right to fight for existence.
If you disgrace me, make a laughingstock of me...
What's she to you?
- And that, Your Honor... the integrity of our fair city... is threatened... sullied by this shameless evil... flaunting in our faces.
This woman, a viper lurking in our midst... a sinister menace to public decency.
I could say no less... and duty compels that the presence among us... of this disgraceful criminal, this scavenger... this unspeakable human... strikes at the very foundation of the Southwest.
A disgrace... to the fair name of our womanhood.
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.
Your Honor... gentlemen of the jury... I am the first to bow to achievement.
May I then, before I begin my poor plea... respectfully call your attention to that which I believe... has never been duplicated before in the history of Oklahoma.
Turn your eye to that figure that has so deservedly held your attention.
- I note the exception.
Gentlemen of the jury... you have heard the prosecution's cruel attack on this defenseless woman.
In that hour of dark terror came a wolf in sheep's clothing, gentlemen.
Surely, you must remember.
- Helpless, crushed by the...
- Objection's overruled.
- I note an exception!
I note that my worthy opponent is exceptionally able at noting exceptions.
Gentlemen... my only object in being here is to try and get at the truth.
For that purpose, Your Honor, I call as witness the defendant...
Miss Dixie Lee.
Miss Lee, you will take the stand.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
You are under oath to tell only the truth.
You'll therefore answer my questions to the best of your ability... and in your own words.
At the death of your father and your dear mother...
- just how old were you?
- I was 15.
Left in comfortable circumstances?
My father had been ill as long as I could remember... and my mother's health had broken nursing him.
They left me without anything.
Now, it isn't my purpose to humiliate you, Miss Lee, in front of these people... but I must ask you to tell them just what followed.
Tell the jury.
Well, I got work in the public library.
I met a man who said he loved me.
We were married secretly.
And then I found out that he already had a wife and that our marriage was a fake.
- Did you continue on with this man?
Did you make an effort to secure employment... so you could earn your own living?
Work of any kind?
Tell the court just what happened.
Well, I managed to get a position as schoolteacher and then... someone found out about me, and I...
And they blamed you instead of the man, and you were forced to get out.
That's leading the witness!
Strike out the question.
Did you try to secure other employment in that town?
They wouldn't listen to me.
- I had to leave.
Well, I got work in another town as a nurse girl.
But the same thing again and again, wherever I went, always the same.
In other words, refused even the poorest kind of work... to try and keep body and soul together.
Irrelevant and immaterial!
- You left out incompetent.
- Sir!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
That is all, Your Honor.
- Thank you, Miss Lee.
Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard only part of the truth.
My worthy opponent objects.
He is afraid of your knowing all the pitiful facts of her life.
Where could she turn in her cruel anguish?
Why, the very promises of God are denied her.
Who was it that said:
"Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden...
"and I will give you rest"?
She is indeed heavy laden... with the persecution of her own sex... why, gentlemen, a thief or murderer may sin alone and is alone to blame.
But this woman is not alone.
Social order is her accomplice.
If she is guilty, then all in this room are guilty.
I charge you, judge not that ye be not judged.
Oh, set her free to go her way.
Let a wisdom higher, far higher than ours... pass judgment on her.
Your Honor, I rest my case.
Gentlemen, you have heard the evidence.
You may retire.
Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
We find the defendant, Dixie Lee, not guilty.
You won by lies, with a trick, and you know it.
Possibly a trick, but I wouldn't say lies, sugar.
Don't you think the result justifies the means?
Justifies?
You stay away five years, come back and do a thing like this.
They've talked about you, said everything about you... and I wouldn't believe them.
But now, what do you expect me to think of you and that woman?
All I've worked for to help things in the town I've got to live in... raise my children in, you've torn down.
I've tried to drive that woman out of Osage.
Honey, if I know anything about Dixie Lee... she'll leave town after today... but driving her out won't help matters.
Dixie Lees have been stoned in the market place for 2,000 years.
You've got to drive the devil out first.
Can't you see, honey, your conscience will be clear?
You haven't sent to prison a woman instead of a real criminal... social order, which you can't change, yet.
My only interest in Dixie Lee was to see that she got one less kick.
You mean, what she said about herself was true?
Every word, sugar.
At times I saw a look in her eyes... I'll never forget.
It's a wonder to me that she hasn't killed herself.
Maybe, if things had been different, she might be like I am... married, safe.
I'm thankful I've got you, that we've got each other... and our home.
Oh, sugar, I love you.
Hell and high water, all the way... there's never been anybody but you, and you know it.
Oh, my boy.
That Bear Creek pool is a whopper.
Say, those Osage Indians are sure striking it rich.
Gobs of money.
You mark my words... this State is gonna be sprouting a million barrels of oil a month, someday.
Sure, and $1 million won't look much, either.
Correct it and print it.
Stand still, Donna... or I'll never have this dress finished for you to take back to school.
Sabra, darling, if you think I'm going back to New York Finishing School... wearing a homemade fizzle like this, you're seriously mistaken.
What will you wear?
I'm not going back to school.
Do you suppose I'm going to let those girls give me the laugh... because we haven't struck oil?
- They think we're all millionaires out here.
- Donna, you're the most...
Why, even the Indians have more money than we've got.
You ought to be punished, big as you are.
And the men in this family, editorials... and maybe governor at $100 a week, maybe.
And Cim, the rising young engineer.
I suppose he's out gassing with Ruby again.
Well, now, I've spoken to him... and I'll give him another good talking to tonight.
Go on, sit down, over there.
I'll stitch this up.
Mother, I'm going out to the Osage reservation.
I've studied enough geology, and they need new engineers out there.
You're not fooling me for one moment, young man.
It's Ruby.
Why, I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself... mooning around with an Indian hired girl.
Ruby isn't an Indian hired girl.
She's the daughter of an Osage chief.
Osage, fiddlesticks.
She's just as important in the Osage nation as... well, as Alice Roosevelt is in Washington.
I've heard just about enough from you, Cimarron Cravat.
And you might just as well know it, that as soon as I'm on my own... I'm gonna marry Ruby.
- Your father will put a stop to this.
- Dad knows.
It's all right with him.
Ruby's waiting, Mother.
Well, that's a nice social problem, an Indian in the family.
Well, I'm going to pick out the richest white man in town and marry him.
Sure struck it rich, Louis.
Yes, boys.
Money's coming in so fast I don't know what to do with it.
- Isn't she a beauty?
- It's a crackerjack!
Hey, Cal, how do you like it?
It's a humdinger.
Latest thing out, folding glass front.
Show them, Irving.
- Thirty, I bet. - Does 30 an hour.
- How's the business, Cal?
They're building another addition to the Bixby house.
- Say, that's great.
- It just couldn't be better.
Hey, boys, don't scratch that.
It's a new car, you know.
I must say, Mr. Levy, your stock is quite up- to-date.
You'll have my orders in at once for my new house?
I'll attend to it myself.
I hear you have a lovely new home.
Small place, 15 rooms.
Mr. Hefner!
- A lift?
- Thank you, I don't mind if I do.
Go ahead, and don't break anything.
- Three cylinders?
- No, two.
I've ordered a four- cylinder.
I'm gonna get one of those new acetylene headlights... so I can see around the corners.
- Now, Irving, careful.
- He might blare the horn.
Goodbye, boys.
I've seen your complaint.
We'd like to inform you that the Oklahoma Wigwam... still prints all the news, all the time.
Knowing no law but the law of God... and the Government of these United States.
Yours very truly.
Well, Rickey, you don't stutter as much as you used to, do you?
You noticed it, Mr. Leary?
I'm getting better all the...
What'd you mention it for?
Cravat is expecting me.
Yes, I'll tell him.
Mr. Cravat, Mr. Pat Leary is here.
All right, Mr. Leary.
Thank you, thank you.
Yance... we've been rather opponents in the past... but there's no reason why we can't be friends.
After all, you haven't gotten very far, I mean, in a moneyed way... with all your talk and editorials.
No, but I have a clear conscience.
I could throw another vote your way to elect you governor.
Yes, you could.
Now, with you in the chair, we've got the chance of a lifetime.
We can fix things so we'd all make plenty of money.
Now, you see, the Indians... they aren't competent to take care of their own... oil leases, and claims, and income.
Now, we'll have an agent appointed for them...
- one that'll do just...
- Now, let me understand.
We'll have an agent appointed... who will steal the money from the Indians?
Well, just a matter of bookkeeping, you know.
- before I'm through with you.
- You ain't coming in, then?
Then I'll smash your chances for governor... and I can do it, too.
Yancey, you know about Cim and Ruby.
We can't live our children's lives for them, honey.
Listen to this, the lead for tomorrow.
"The demagogues plan to rob them again.
"Stealing the vast ocean of oil gushing up through the miserable, barren land...
"known as the Osage Indian reservation...
"again victimizing those duped and wretched Americans, the Osage Indians.
"Their treaties broken, their land stolen...
"and now there's about to burst forth the gaudiest...
"star-spangled piece of crookedness...
"ever played under the wing of a double-dealing government."
- We can't print that.
This isn't the Cimarron country. It's the State of Oklahoma.
You can't slur the government.
I don't blame the government for crooked politicians' tricks.
I'll stop them if it's the last thing I ever do.
- Furthermore... the time has come to give the red man full citizenship... so he can live as free as the white man lives.
Citizenship for Indians.
Give them the vote.
The people here would mob you.
A prophet is never without honor, save in his own country.
You could be one of the greatest figures in this nation.
You are if you don't throw it away.
If you print that article, you'll never be governor.
I've forgiven you many things in the past 10 years, Yancey Cravat... but I'll never forgive you that.
Oh, yes, you will, sugar.
Never is a long time.
Not while I'm alive, maybe... but someday you'll be able to turn back to the old files... and read this article and be glad it was printed.
No, I have some position to maintain in this community.
- I have some voice in this paper.
Well, then I say you won't print it, not in these columns.
When you take my name off and put yours in its place... you'll be editor of this paper.
Until you do that, sugar, I am.
Will you send Rickey in, please?
The proof's all right, Rickey.
Just think, our 40th anniversary.
Well, that's the longest time I ever stayed in one place.
The longest time in one place.
Haven't you ever heard from the boss?
He doesn't write letters, Rickey.
The only news I've ever had was from that captain... who thought he saw him at Chateau
- Thierry... with his hair dyed black.
He's alive somewhere, I know it.
Now, you just keep on believing that, ma'am.
Have you decided on the editorial for the anniversary number?
Yes, we'll reprint the one on Indian citizenship... from the 1907 file.
I have that one marked.
I'll never forget the flood of clippings... that came in from all over the country... and they called him the nation's leading editor.
Yes, and since then, Congress has granted all he asked for.
Yes, that's it.
I'm setting it up in 12 point.
- And use the same signature card.
The card, s'il vous plait.
The card, monsieur.
I printed them.
Quite an affair, ain't it, Sol?
Yes, nice.
The card, madame.
I'm on the committee.
Sorry, Mr. Levy, about your not being on the committee.
You see... we invited representatives of our principal families.
One of my ancestors was a signer of the Declaration of Independence.
A relative of mine, a fellow named Moses, wrote the Ten Commandments.
Ladies and gentlemen... as Chairman of the Oklahoma Progressive State Committee, I greet you.
And now it is my privilege to ask you... to drink to the health of our guest of honor.
My poor words could add nothing... to the sterling achievements of our fellow townswoman... who has risen to eminence in Oklahoma... and finally in the councils of the nation.
I therefore call upon the one you are waiting to hear... our new congresswoman, Sabra Cravat.
My friends... today I stand before you in a new responsibility.
Time has passed for many of us... since we first met in the early days of Osage.
Time that mellows our hearts and tells us all the truth.
To many others among you... including our distinguished guests from Washington... I appear more or less as a stranger.
I want you to know me and mine, as we are... to meet my family, as if you were in my home.
First, my youngest, my daughter, Donna...
Mrs. Louis Hefner.
Next, my firstborn... my boy, Cimarron.
And now, one who has become a member of our family by marriage... my son's wife, a chief's daughter... a full-blooded Osage Indian...
Ruby Big Elk, Mrs. Cimarron Cravat.
I greet you in words taught me as a child.
May you long travel the path of life... in days that are calm and peaceful.
And my grandchildren...
Felice and Yancey II.
I'm sorry, this afternoon, that I cannot present to you... my husband... but he's out of the city.
I know he would be glad to be here to greet you.
As for myself... I can only thank you for the office you have conferred upon me.
The women of Oklahoma... have helped build a prairie wilderness into the state of today.
The holding of public office by a woman is a natural step.
I pledge you that I will do my best.
That pate de foie gras was good, wasn't it?
Now, what do you think of women in politics?
You know, I'm curious to see the subject of this pioneer statue.
I hear that the Governor's sending his staff down for the unveiling.
We must see it.
Congratulations, I enjoyed every moment of it.
- This was worth the trip from Washington.
- So nice to see you.
The Osage nations, through me, extends congratulations.
Wonderful, Sabra.
I never heard anything like it.
- Your dress is so becoming.
- You like it?
I like your hat, too.
Well, I must be going.
My feet hurt me.
The state bankers will be very pleased to see you in Congress, Mrs. Cravat.
We're proud of a woman who has done what you have done... alone.
I feel as you have always felt.
Yancey is just out of town for a little while.
Mother, you were sweet about Dad.
If you are ready, Sabra, we will start at once.
Yes, I'll be right with you.
We leave for Bowlegs immediately, gentlemen.
It's a new empire.
Quite a pretty place isn't it, Mrs. Cravat?
All this up from raw prairie.
Field office?
Osage, three.
We've never had a closer call.
Gusher came in ahead of time.
They were lowering a torpedo of nitroglycerin.
Before they could explode it, up came the mud and oil, and the torpedo with it.
Narrow escape?
What nerve!
- He saved our lives.
That's all.
- Was he badly hurt?
Jammed against a rake.
Chest crushed, pretty bad.
- Who was he?
Just an old drifter who'd been hanging around here since the new field opened.
Some of the fellas call him old Yance.
Yance.
Stainless woman.
Hide me.
Hide me in your love.
Sleep, my boy.
CITY LIGHTS
"To the people of this city we donate this monument; 'Peace and Prosperity'."
"Did you pick it up, sir ?"
"Wait for your change, sir."
Evening.
"Grandma."
"Tomorrow the birds will sing."
"Be brave !
Face life !"
"No, I'll end it all !"
"I'm cured.
You're my friend for life."
"We'll go home and get warmed up."
"Any news ?"
"Only that your wife sent for her baggage, sir."
"Good !"
"Here's to our friendship --"
"No, I'll live !"
"James - the Rolls-Royce.
We'll burn up the town !"
Early morning;
homeward bound.
"Be careful how you're driving."
"Am I driving ?"
"I like your car."
"Then keep it, it's yours."
"Where's my friend ?"
"Let him in, he's my guest !"
"Let's buy some flowers."
"Here's ten dollars."
"I haven't any change, sir."
"Take these inside; I'll be right back."
"Thank you for your kindness, sir."
"May I see you home again ?"
"Whenever you wish, sir."
The sober dawn awakens a different man.
"I'm out to everybody !"
"Whoever he is, get rid of him !"
"-- and then he brought me home in his car."
"He must be wealthy."
"Yes, but he's more than that."
That afternoon.
"My friend !"
"Come on home, I'll give you a swell party."
The morning after.
"I'm sailing at noon, so hurry !"
"She has a fever and needs careful attention."
Determined to help the girl, he found work.
FINAL NOTICE Madam:
You are owing $22.00 rent.
"Grandma, he's coming today !"
"Grandma, what's wrong ?"
"Grandma, I wish you'd meet him;
you're never here when he calls."
Lunch time.
"Have you seen the soap ?"
"Be back on time !"
"To play the part of a gentleman without the millionaire was difficult, but he did his best."

"Get out !"
"Do you want to make some easy money ?"
"Remember, we split fifty-fifty;
and you promise you won't hurt me."
"Be careful, the boss might hear us."

"Do you want to fight for a fifty dollar purse ?"
Winner take all.
"You'll fight him !"
"That's my lucky rabbit's foot."
"Let's take it easy and we'll split fifty-fifty."
"Winner take all !"
Still hoping to get money for the girl, he wandered the city.
Back from Europe.
"Now don't worry about the girl, I'll take care of her."
"Will a thousand dollars be enough ?"
"Police !
Help !"
"He has been robbed, search that man !"
"Where did you get this money ?"
"Tell him you gave me that money."
"Who is this man ?"
"This is for the rent."
"And this is for your eyes."
"I must be going."
"How can I ever thank you ?"
"You're not going away ?"
"For awhile."
"But you're coming back !"
"I'd like to order some flowers."
"Why, what's the matter, child ?"
"Nothing, only I thought he had returned."
"I've made a conquest !"
"You ?"
"You can see now ?"
"Yes, I can see now."
I thought I smelled gas.
That's three this year.
They haven't even the decency to leave enough for the gas bill.
I wonder why she did it.
She seemed so full of fun.
- They all end up that way.
- You're going to go the same way.
I'm not afraid of life.
Although I am not afraid of death, either.
Come on. Move on, move on.
Shall we go somewhere?
Away from this unpleasant house?
It's not always so unpleasant. I live here.
- Shall I drop in another coin?
- Do I sound like a Pianola?
I suppose you are a great musician?
No, but I do know something about music.
Your sweetheart?
I have done enough talking for tonight.
Would you like to make some easy money?
Is there any such thing?
I heard you say that you are not afraid of life or of death.
Now, I have connections, secret, with a certain government.
I need a woman who knows how to deal with men.
- It's against Austria, of course.
I'd like to get some wine.
I suppose I ought to pay for it.
- What for?
We know how to take care of spies.
Austria may not care what happens to you, but you certainly do care what happens to Austria.
Beg your pardon, sir.
Tell her to see me tomorrow at ten.
- Good night, sir.
Name, please?
I'd prefer not to give my name.
- Quite a walk, isn't it?
- I don't mind walking.
I must tell you. I could walk with you forever.
Don't smoke in here, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry, sir.
I took a lot of trouble last night, after I left, to obtain some information about you.
Ha! It took me hours to get dry.
You are the widow of Captain Ferdinand Kolverer, who died last year.
My husband was killed in action.
As you may have guessed by now, I am in charge... of the Secret Service of lmperial Austria.
There are times when a man's brain cannot accomplish as much as a woman's charm.
As you demonstrated last night. Ha!
You completely fooled me.
Had me arrested!
You are a clever woman, and a very loyal one.
We lost 40,000 men here, two days ago.
And here, 18,000.
Look at those men marching.
Marching into the jaws of death.
Unless I can uncover a certain system of communication with the enemy.
So you wish me to become a spy.
You dislike the word "spy"?
Perhaps I have no right to object to any word.
You haven't.
ln return for your services, I shall provide you with a magnificent home, servants, all the money you may need.
What appeals to me is the chance to serve my country.
It is now my duty to point out to you that the profession of a spy is the most ignoble calling on earth.
Lower than anything you may have ever experienced.
And it is dangerous, of course.
I've had an inglorious life.
It may become my good fortune to have a glorious death.
Bring the Hindau file.
This is Colonel von Hindau.
Attached to a chief of staff of our own army.
I have reason to believe that he is a traitor.
But I have been unable to prove it.
He knows every operator in my department.
But he doesn't know you... yet!
This is your first assignment.
I am sending you the widow of Captain Kolverer, who will enter the service as X-27.
She will receive instructions from me.
- May I have this dance? - May I?
I suppose you are too exhausted playing with balloons to stand up.
Certainly I'll stand up, if you'll hand me my crutches.
I might have known you'd be with the prettiest woman in the place.
- I'd forgotten all about you.
- Get rid of her. Sit down.
- Haven't we?
I wish I were in your boots.
Drop me off on your way home.
You have extraordinary luck with women, Colonel.
I can't complain. - Can I?
- You shouldn't, tonight.
Not unless I take you away from him.
Ha-ha-ha. Hands off.
Don't get excited, Colonel.
Cigarette or no cigarette, you keep your hands off.
Do you want me to?
Let me first see your face without the mask.
One face at a time.
Lucky for you both I'm getting out here.
Fritz, bring the champagne.
Will you take off your cape?
Well, take your time.
Take off my glove.
What a soft hand!
You are wanted on the telephone, sir.
It's the head of the Secret Service.
He insists on speaking to you, sir.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Don't stay away too long.
- Hindau?
I hope I didn't disturb you.
You know I have been working on a new formula for invisible ink that defies detection?
Looking for something, madam?
Where do you hide your cigarettes?
You'll not find any in this house.
My master doesn't smoke.
Shall I send out for some?
The champagne is very excellent, madam.
I am certain it is.
What time will you be over? Ten?
Make it eleven.
I don't like to get up so early in the morning.
- Eleven would be better.
I hope she had time enough to look around. Ha!
She won't find anything.
I had that house searched a dozen times.
You like Russian cigarettes?
This one is marvellous.
- Out of your coat pocket.
- Going through my pockets already?
- Mm-hm. Would you like a puff?
But I think we'd better start on the champagne.
I suppose you've also had the house surrounded. Yes.
I'm sorry, it's my job.
What a charming evening we might have had... if you hadn't been a spy, and I a... traitor.
Then we might never have met.
I don't know to whom I would rather surrender.
I'll wait for your men in the library.
Perhaps that was the best way, for him and for us.
I am going after the other man.
Take charge.
- Hello, Marie.
Hello, Marie.
All bets down.
30 on the red.
Would you mind putting your hand on my other shoulder?
Game.
34 on the red even.
Would you mind changing your tune?
Well, yes, I'll stop.
Perhaps I can bring you a bit of luck, Captain.
Good luck or bad luck?
Good luck.
Try number... 27.
27?
27. 27?
27 hasn't a chance.
What will you give me if it loses?
- Anything you like.
- Suppose we start with a kiss?
Push that over onto 27.
I hope it loses.
26 on the black even.
When do I collect?
Let's have a drink before we go.
Two Bacardis.
Do you like to gamble?
I like anything that excites me.
I'm glad you came along.
I was just becoming bored.
That's one of the reasons I think I could like you.
You excite me.
You know, most people think of death as a very ugly old man.
I think of death as a beautiful young woman wearing flowers.
- Roses?
- Well, she might be wearing roses.
- What makes you think of death? - Hm.
Was I thinking of death?
I have the feeling we've met before.
Have we?
When?
Let me see, when did we meet before?
Have you ever been wounded?
Aviators are rarely wounded.
We fly or are killed.
How about that kiss, lady?
Kiss?
Oh, what a charming sense of humour!
You were no match for this man, who is far too clever to be trapped by a woman.
Your experience was insufficient to deal with him alone.
You had no right to assume responsibility for the arrest of a man who is worth an entire Russian division.
Your plane takes off in an hour.
Be careful with your new assignment.
I've come for that kiss.
You may have been joking about it, but I wasn't.
- Don't you like to be kissed?
- You are so powerful.
Don't you like powerful men?
I am glad you escaped.
Your untimely death might have disturbed my conscience.
Nonsense, it's all in the game.
Had I caught you in my country, I'd have had you shot without hesitation.
But we're both alive yet, and you can make my last few hours in Vienna very pleasant.
Are you going to leave Vienna so soon?
I'm afraid I'll have to, or give up my profession.
It's become too dangerous.
Perhaps I can persuade you to stay.
I really don't need persuasion.
You're not going to turn me over because of a kiss?
Are you going to shoot me yourself?
Yes, if you leave me no other choice.
Your conscience, apparently, is not going to be disturbed this time.
Shoot quickly, or I'll take that plaything away from you.
I think I removed the cartridges.
This would have been quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
Do you like this masquerade as well as my last one?
- You are still a clown.
- I'm a colonel in the Russian Army.
When necessary, I fly across the line, and play the clown, or the Austrian officer.
I am a soldier, but you bring something into war that doesn't belong in it.
You trick men into death with your body.
You're a cheat and a liar.
Why don't you stay here?
Perhaps I don't always cheat and lie.
If you kept me here another minute, I'd not only be in danger of losing my life, but of falling in love with you, you devil!
A few thousand feet higher up we might find better weather, but I doubt it.
And now your division is to attack from S-32 to V-29.
Your objective is the railhead at T-18.
That carries us through the fifth day.
On the sixth day, your division, with the 63rd and 7 4th, attack from N-1 7 to R-21.
Your objective will be the heights at Q-1 1 to Q-15.
Does the attack begin on the ninth?
Yes, at five o'clock in the morning.
Four days from now.
Come on down here.
Did anyone ever tell you how pretty you are?
Fresh from the country, aren't you?
Do they work you very hard in this magnificent establishment?
Are you going to be off duty pretty soon?
You're not going to see some young lieutenant tonight, are you?
Captain?
A major, perhaps?
Then we'll start with a colonel.
You want a general?
I don't want anyone to enter or leave these headquarters without a pass issued by me.
That woman is in this hotel.
- Count ten.
- I don't want to count ten any more.
Count ten.
One, two, three, four, five...
Eight, eight, nine...
Come on out here.
Come on out.
Oh, she's lost.
Come down here.
It's warm up here.
Come down here or get out.
- Are you coming down or not?
- Haven't I counted ten before?
I'm not going to count any more.
I'm tired...
I 'mtired.
Let me see a list of your maids.
- Who are the maids on the second floor?
- Day maid's Olga.
Night maid's Catherine.
Catherine, eh?
Is she a new maid here?
Came three days ago.
I change maids all the time.
Can't keep them.
Too many officers quartered here.
- What do you know about Catherine?
Papers are all correct.
Anything wrong again?
Take your hat off when you talk to a Russian officer, if you know what's good for you.
Corporal, force the door.
Who's been with you?
Office of the Guard!
Get the Office of the Guard.
Have that woman brought to my room.
Now you can tell all that to the Colonel.
Everybody makes mistakes.
And you carry a cat.
It has brought me good luck, so far.
- Do you call this good luck?
Besides, I am not allowed to love anything else.
I like your masquerade.
I'm sorry, I'll have to search you, X-27.
Take your things off.
Is it warm enough in here?
Don't catch cold.
Hm. Music!
- Did you write this?
Your own composition, eh?
I don't use invisible ink.
What do you call this masterpiece?
I haven't named it yet.
May I suggest you call it The Dance Of The Russian Colonels?
Shall I go on with my undressing?
I'm in the mood for music first.
- Would you play this?
- If you furnish the piano.
I'll furnish the piano, and the audience.
I wish I could read notes.
Let me play it for you.
I don't know what this code means.
But I have an idea that each note might mean the death of a thousand soldiers.
My poor composition.
I worked so hard on it, and now it's in ashes.
- I destroy everything dangerous to Russia.
- I'm next, I suppose?
You know the fate of spies when they're caught.
How many more hours does my fate allow me?
This is quite a feather in your cap, isn't it?
For three days and nights, I've had no other thought but to find you.
And now I've caught you.
lsn't it strange I'd give a lot to undo it?
Why don't you let me go, then?
Is there any other wish I can grant?
I'd like to share my last few hours on earth with you.
Do you think you can fool me as easily as you did the adjutant?
I give you my word of honour that I no longer want anything but to be with you.
It's easy to grant you almost anything.
I think I'm falling madly in love with you.
The more you cheat and the more you lie, the more exciting you become, X-27.
I wish this night could last forever.
It will be dawn soon.
I don't understand why you should choose a road that leads to such a death.
Not a bad death, to die for my country.
It's better than gas or the river.
What has gas or the river to do with you?
Nothing.
Let's not talk of death any more.
This is our last drink together.
What shall we drink to?
- To love and excitement.
To love and excitement.
- What did you put into this wine?
- Only a few drops of sleep.
You think you can get away?
Here!
Ink's still wet, huh?
I wish I were an officer.
Your plane will leave for Vienna in two hours.
- Nikolai Chemochenko.
Won't talk, eh?
- Ivan Petrov.
Won't talk.
- lvorich Chernovy.
These birds are a gabby lot.
- Name.
Division.
Won't even give your name, eh?
All right, sir, as you like.
Bring in the next batch.
Come on, step up.
- Hassan Martinko.
- Nikolai Abramov.
Division!
Name, please.
- Name!
Well, that looks like a catch.
May I question that officer who refused to give his name?
Will you come back here, Colonel?
I've never seen you before.
You have a very faulty memory for a spy.
- You're mistaken.
- How do you explain this, Colonel?
Well, this does resemble me, doesn't it?
When were you on Austrian territory last?
The Russian Army has been on Austrian territory ever since the war started.
Let me have your fingerprints.
This will be your last visit to this country, Colonel.
- Arrange a court martial.
- I will, Your Excellency.
Take charge of the case, Major.
Send in the next batch.
- Will you come with me?
- Yes, sir. With pleasure.
- Ivan Turgenev.
Next?
- Name? - I don't smoke.
Don't you think that before shooting a spy, we should make him talk?
- You can't make Russians talk.
- I think I can.
He's a dangerous character.
- I'll be careful.
- Turn the prisoner over to her, Lieutenant.
Wire headquarters at once, Colonel, and inform them of the capture of H-14, of the Russian Secret Service,
and that we are planning to execute him, possibly tonight.
- Will you please wait outside?
- I wouldn't take any chances with this man.
- I'll take responsibility for that.
You still don't seem to remember me.
It may be good for you that I don't choose to remember you.
- This gun is loaded.
- What is it you want?
I have ten minutes in which to make you talk.
You're wasting your time and mine.
What would you rather do than talk?
If you don't mind, I'd rather be up in the air, flying.
Well, my old friend. He did bring you good luck, after all.
Watch me, and I'll show you how to play with a gun.
I've an even chance now.
I don't know whether I can get away, but there seem to be plenty of planes outside.
If it weren't going to be more exciting out there, I'd be tempted to stay with you.
Hope you're on my side, next war!
Before the sentence, have you anything to say?
No, I have nothing to say.
Perhaps I loved him.
You can't make me believe you can love a man you've known for a few hours.
That sort of love can be bought on the streets.
I found her on the streets.
You had a chance to redeem your unfortunate life in the service of your country.
Can you give one reason you failed to take advantage of that privilege?
I suppose I'm not much good, that's all.
Will you please stand up?
You have left us no choice in your case.
The crime is treason and the penalty is death.
You will be executed tomorrow morning at dawn.
Can I help you, daughter?
I am going to face this journey, too, alone.
You have no fear of this death?
It's only another exciting adventure.
A perfect end to an imperfect life.
How much more time have I?
About ten hours.
Could you possibly help me to die in a uniform of my own choosing?
What would you call a uniform of your own choosing?
Any dress I wore when I served my countrymen instead of my country.
I will send for your clothes. Anything else?
A piano. One that's in tune.
I will see what can be done.
Will you please follow me?
Are we going to walk together again?
Do you happen to have a looking glass?
Will this do?
May I please bandage your eyes?
I will not kill a woman.
I will not kill any more men, either.
Do you call this war?
I call it butchery!
You call this serving your country?
You call this patriotism? I call it murder!
"Among the rugged peaks that frown down upon the Borgo Pass "are found crumbling castles of a bygone age."
I say, driver, a bit slower.
No, no! We must reach the inn before sundown.
And why, pray?
It is Walpurgis Night, the night of evil.
On this night, madam, the doors, they are barred and to the Virgin we pray.
I say, porter. Don't take my luggage down.
I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.
No, no, please.
Put that back up there.
The driver, he is afraid.
Walpurgis Night.
Good fellow, he is.
He wants me to ask if you can wait and go on after sunrise.
Well, I'm sorry, but there's a carriage meeting me at Borgo Pass at midnight.
Borgo Pass?
Whose carriage?
Count Dracula's.
Count Dracula's?
Castle Dracula?
Yes, that's where I'm going.
To the castle?
No. You mustn't go there.
We people of the mountains believe at the castle there are vampires!
Dracula and his wives. They take the form of wolves and bats.
They leave their coffins at night and they feed on the blood of the living.
Oh, but that's all superstition.
Why, I can't understand why...
Look, the sun.
When it is gone, they leave their coffins.
Come. We must go indoors.
But wait!
I mean, just a minute, I...
What I'm trying to say is that I'm not afraid.
I've explained to the driver that it's a matter of business with me.
If you must go, wear this, for your mother's sake.
The coach from Count Dracula?
Hey, driver!
I say, driver, what do you mean by going at this...
It's really good to see you.
I don't know what happened to the driver and my luggage and...
Well, and with all this, I thought I was in the wrong place.
What music they make.
The spider spinning his web for the unwary fly.
The blood is the life, Mr. Renfield.
I'm sure you will find this part of my castle more inviting.
Well, rather.
It's quite different from outside.
Oh, and the fire, it's so cheerful.
I didn't know, but that you might be hungry.
That's very kind of you, but I'm a bit worried about my luggage.
You see, all your papers were in...
I took the liberty of having your luggage brought up.
I trust you have kept your coming here a secret.
I've followed your instructions implicitly.
Excellent, Mr. Renfield.
And now, if you're not too fatigued, I would like to discuss the lease on Carfax Abbey.
Everything is in order awaiting your signature.
Well, here.
Here's the lease.
Why, I hope I've brought enough labels for your luggage.
I'm taking with me only three boxes.
I have chartered a ship to take us to England.
We will be leaving tomorrow evening.
I hope you will find this comfortable.
It looks very inviting.
Oh, it's nothing serious.
Just a small cut from that paper clip.
It's just a scratch.
This is very old wine.
I hope you will like it.
I never drink wine.
And now I'll leave you.
Good night, Mr. Renfield.
Master, the sun is gone!
You will keep your promise when we get to London, won't you, Master?
You will see that I get lives?
Not human lives, but small ones with blood in them.
I'll be loyal to you, Master.
Must be a Scandinavian ship.
That's what it looks to me like. Here now, here now, get back.
Nobody goes aboard this here boat but the authorities.
The captain dead, tied to the wheel.
Horrible tragedy, horrible tragedy.
Master, we're here!
You can't hear what I'm saying, but we're here!
We're safe!
They must have come through a terrible storm.
Why, it's come from that hatchway!
Why, he's mad!
Why, the man's gone crazy.
Violets! Violets!
Flower for your buttonhole, sir. Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole. Here's a nice one.
And after you deliver the message, you will remember nothing I now say.
Dr. Seward?
Yes? You're wanted on the telephone.
Thank you.
Well, excuse me, dear. Oh, Father, if it's from home, will you say I'm spending the night in town with Lucy?
All right, dear.
Pardon me.
Yes? I could not help overhearing your name.
Might I inquire if you are the Dr. Seward whose sanitarium is at Whitby?
Why, yes.
I'm Count Dracula.
I have just leased Carfax Abbey. I understand it adjoins your grounds.
Why, yes, it does.
I'm very happy to make your acquaintance.
May I present my daughter Mina?
Miss Weston.
And Mr. Harker.
Count Dracula's just taken Carfax Abbey.
Oh, it'll be a relief to see light in those dismal old windows.
It will, indeed. You'll excuse me, I'm wanted on the telephone.
The Abbey could be very attractive, but I should imagine it would need quite extensive repairs.
I shall do very little repairing.
It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in Transylvania.
The Abbey always reminds me of that old toast about lofty timbers.
"The walls around are bare, "echoing to our laughter "as though the dead were there."
Nice little sentiment.
But there's more, even nicer.
"Pass a cup to the dead already, "a round for the next to die..."
Oh, never mind the rest, dear.
To die, to be really dead, that must be glorious.
Why, Count Dracula!
There are far worse things awaiting man than death.
Oh, Lucy. You're so romantic.
Laugh all you like.
I suppose he's all right.
But give me someone a little more normal.
Like John?
Yes, dear, like John.
Castle. Dracula!
Transylvania.
Well, Countess, I'll leave you to your Count and his ruined abbey.
Good night, Lucy.
Good night, dear.
The fog seems to be closing down a bit, sir.
Another death.
Dead.
Dr. Seward, when did Miss Weston have the last transfusion?
About four hours ago.
An unnatural loss of blood, which we've been powerless to check.
On the throat of each victim, the same two marks.
He probably wants his flies again!
No, Martin, please!
Please don't, Martin!
Here, give it to me now!
No, no, no, Martin! Please!
Martin, don't! Don't throw my spider away from me.
Ain't you ashamed now? Ain't you?
Spiders now, is it?
Flies ain't good enough?
Flies? Flies?
Poor, puny things.
Who wants to eat flies?
You do, you loony.
Not when I can get nice, fat spiders!
Have it your own way.
Read, dummkopf, where I have marked.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with the undead.
Nosferatu?
Yes, Nosferatu, the undead, the vampire.
The vampire attacks the throat.
It leaves two little wounds, white with red centers.
Dr. Seward, your patient, Renfield, whose blood I have just analyzed, is obsessed with the idea that he must devour living things in order to sustain his own life.
But Professor Van Helsing, modern medical science does not admit of such a creature.
The vampire is a pure myth, superstition.
I may be able to bring you proof that the superstition of yesterday can become the scientific reality of today.
But, Professor, Renfield's cravings have always been for small living things.
Nothing human.
As far as we know, Doctor.
But you tell me that he escapes from his room. He is gone for hours.
Well, Mr. Renfield, you are looking much better than you did this morning when I arrived.
Thanks, I'm feeling much better.
You understand that, do you not?
And I'm very grateful.
Keep your filthy hands to yourself!
Now, now, Renfield.
Oh, Dr. Seward, send me away from this place.
Send me far away.
Why are you so anxious to get away?
My cries at night, they might disturb Miss Mina.
They might give her bad dreams, Professor Van Helsing.
That sounded like a wolf.
But I hardly think there are wolves so near London.
He thinks they're wolves.
Me, I've heard them howl at night before.
He thinks they're talking to him.
He howls and howls back at them.
He's crazy!
We know why the wolves talk, do we not, Mr. Renfield?
And we know how we can make them stop.
You know too much to live, Van Helsing.
We'll get no more out of him now for a while.
Take him away, Martin.
On your way, old fly eater.
I'm warning you, Dr. Seward. If you don't send me away, you must answer for what will happen to Miss Mina!
All right, Martin.
Come along, now, come along.
What was that herb that excited him so?
Wolfsbane. It is a plant that grows in central Europe.
The natives there use it to protect themselves against vampires.
Renfield reacted very violently to its scent.
Seward, I want you to have Renfield closely watched by day and night, especially by night.
Master, you've come back.
No, Master, please! Please don't ask me to do that!
Don't! Not her!
Please! Please don't, Master!
I lay in bed for quite a while, reading.
And just as I was commencing to get drowsy, I heard dogs howling.
And when the dream came, it seemed the whole room was filled with mist.
It was so thick, I could just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog.
And then I saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white livid face came down out of the mist.
It came closer and closer.
I felt its breath on my face, and then its lips.
Dear, it was only a dream.
And then, in the morning, I felt so weak.
It seemed as if all the life had been drained out of me.
Darling, we're going to forget all about these dreams, think about something cheerful, aren't we?
Allow me.
Oh, certainly, Professor.
Think for a moment.
Is there anything that might have brought this dream on?
Doctor, there's something troubling Mina, something she won't tell us.
And the face in the dream, you say it seemed to come closer and closer?
The lips touched you?
Is there anything the matter with your throat?
Oh, no, but I...
Permit me.
No, please!
Yes, yes.
How long have you had those little marks?
Marks?
Mina, why didn't you let us know?
Do not excite her.
When, Miss Mina?
Since the morning after the dream.
What could have caused them, Professor?
Count Dracula!
It's good to see you back again, Doctor.
I heard you have just arrived.
And you, Miss Mina. You're looking exceptionally...
Pardon me, Dr. Seward, but I think Miss Mina should go to her room at once.
Professor Van Helsing, I don't believe it's as important as you seem to think it is.
Count Dracula, Professor Van Helsing.
Van Helsing. A most distinguished scientist whose name we know, even in the wilds of Transylvania.
I had a frightful dream a few nights ago, and I don't seem to be able to get it out of my mind.
I hope you haven't taken my stories too seriously.
Stories?
In my humble effort to amuse your fiancÃ©e, Mr. Harker, I was telling her some rather grim tales of my far-off country.
I can imagine.
Why, John!
I can quite understand Mr. Harker's concern.
I'm afraid it's quite serious.
My dear, I'm sure Count Dracula will excuse you.
You must go to your room as Professor Van Helsing suggests.
Oh, but, really, Father, I'm feeling quite well.
You had better do as your father advises.
Miss Mina? May I call later and inquire how you're feeling?
Why, yes. Thank you.
I'm sorry, Doctor. My visit was so ill-timed.
On the contrary, it may prove to be most enlightening. In fact, before you go, you can be of definite service.
Anything I can do. Gladly.
A moment ago,
I stumbled upon a most amazing phenomenon, something so incredible, I mistrust my own judgment.
Look.
Dr. Seward, my humble apology.
I dislike mirrors.
Van Helsing will explain.
For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you are a wise man, Van Helsing.
Whew. What on earth caused that?
Did you see the look on his face?
Like a wild animal!
Wild animal?
Like a madman!
What's that running across the lawn?
Looks like a huge dog!
Or a wolf?
A Wolf?
He was afraid we might follow.
Follow?
Sometimes they take the form of wolves, but generally of bats.
But what's Dracula got to do with wolves and bats?
Dracula is our vampire.
But surely, Professor...
A vampire casts no reflection in the glass.
That is why Dracula smashed the mirror.
I don't mean to be rude, but that's the sort of thing I'd expect one of the patients here to say.
Yes, and that is what your English doctors would say, your police.
The strength of the vampire is that people will not believe in him.
Professor, vampires only exist in ghost stories.
A vampire, Mr. Harker, is a being that lives after its death by drinking the blood of the living. It must have blood or it dies.
Its power lasts only from sunset to sunrise.
During the hours of the day, it must rest in the earth in which it was buried.
But then, if Dracula were a vampire, he'd have to return every night to Transylvania, and that's impossible.
Then he must have brought his native soil with him, boxes of it.
Boxes of earth large enough for him to rest in.
Did you hear what we were saying?
Yes, I heard something.
Be guided by what he says.
It's your only hope.
It's her only hope.
I begged you to send me away, but you wouldn't.
Now it's too late.
It's happened again.
Take her away from here.
Take her away before...
No, no, Master!
I wasn't going to say anything!
I told them nothing!
I'm loyal to you, Master.
What have you to do with Dracula?
I never even heard the name before.
You will die in torment if you die with innocent blood on your soul.
God will not damn a lunatic's soul.
He knows that the powers of evil are too great for those of us with weak minds.
Oh, Mr. Harker! Mr. Harker, it's horrible!
Oh, it's horrible! Dr. Seward!
Miss Mina, out there dead!
Where? Out there!
Thank heaven she's alive. Thank heaven for that.
Alive, yes, but in greater danger, for she's already under his influence.
It's horrible, Van Helsing, horrible!
Incredible. Incredible, perhaps, but a fact. We must face it.
We must cope with it.
"Further attacks on small children committed after dark "by the mysterious woman in white took place last night.
And then, Miss Mina?
Well, how could she know anything about the woman in white?
It's bad enough for her to read it in the newspaper...
Please, please, Mr. Harker.
And when was the next time you saw Miss Lucy after she was buried?
I was downstairs on the terrace.
She came out of the shadows and stood looking at me.
I started to speak to her.
And then I remembered she was dead.
The most horrible expression came over her face.
She looked like a hungry animal. A Wolf.
And then she turned and ran back into the dark.
Then you know the woman in white is...
Miss Mina, I promise you that after tonight she will remain at rest, her soul released from this horror.
If you can save Lucy's soul after death, promise me you'll save mine.
Darling, you're not going to die, you're going to live.
You mustn't touch me.
And you mustn't kiss me ever again.
What are you trying to say?
You make him understand.
Professor?
It's all over, John.
Our love, our life together.
No, no, donâ€™t look at me like that.
I love you, John. You.
But this horror, he wills it.
Miss Mina, you must come indoors.
You know what you're doing to her, Professor? You're driving her crazy!
Mr. Harker, that is what you should be worrying about. The last rays of the day's sun will soon be gone, and another night will be upon us.
Dr. Seward, I'm taking Mina with me to London tonight or I'll call in the police.
But, John...
Mina, please get your bags packed.
Seward, I must be master here or I can do nothing.
Miss Mina, both this room and your bedroom have been prepared with wolfsbane.
You will be safe if Dracula returns.
She'll be safe, all right, because she's going with me.
Mina, I'll be waiting for you in the library. Oh, John!
Father, talk to him.
Please don't let him go.
Oh, Briggs-
Miss Mina is to wear this wreath of wolfsbane when she goes to bed.
Watch her closely, and see that she does not remove it in her sleep.
I understand, Professor.
And under no circumstances must these windows be opened tonight.
Very well, sir.
You will recollect that Dracula cast no reflection in the mirror.
And that three boxes of earth were delivered to him at Carfax Abbey.
Well, Dr. Seward, what about it?
Is Mina going with me or not?
If you take her from under our protection, you will kill her.
Now, John, please, please, be patient.
Mr. Harker, please, come here.
Well.
John, I know you love her, but don't forget she's my daughter, and I must do what I think is best.
Mr. Harker, I have devoted my lifetime to the study of many strange things, little-known facts, which the world is perhaps better off not knowing.
I know, but, Professor, all I want is to get Mina away from all of this.
That will do no good.
Our only chance of saving Miss Mina's life is to find the hiding place of Dracula's living corpse and to drive a stake through its heart.
Isn't this a strange conversation for men who aren't crazy?
Renfield, you're compelling me to put you in a straitjacket.
You forget, Doctor, that madmen have great strength.
Dracula has great strength, eh, Renfield?
Oh, Martin. Didn't I warn you to keep a strict watch?
What? Again?
The doctor's pet loony is loose again.
He came and stood below my window in the moonlight.
And he promised me things.
Not in words, but by doing them.
Doing them?
By making them happen.
A red mist spread over the lawn, coming on like a flame of fire.
And then he parted it.
And I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red, like his, only smaller.
And then he held up his hand, and they all stopped.
And I thought he seemed to be saying,
"Rats. Rats.
"Rats!"
Thousands, millions of them.
"All red blood,
"all these will I give you "if you will obey me."
That which has already been done.
Strike me down dead, Doctor.
He's got me going.
Now he's twisted and broken them iron bars as if they was cheese.
Dracula is in the house.
In the house?
Doctor, this time he can do no harm.
We are ready for him.
Martin, come with me.
I'll show you where we can put Mr. Renfield where he won't escape again.
All right, but I have me doubts.
Come along, old fly eater.
Now, you mustn't get out of it this time.
I'm awfully sorry to have to look you up, but you've got to stay in your room.
Now that you have learned what you have learned, it would be well for you to return to your own country.
I prefer to remain and protect those whom you would destroy.
My blood now flows through her veins.
She will live through the centuries to come, as I have lived.
Should you escape us, Dracula, we know how to save Miss Mina's soul, if not her life.
If she dies by day.
But I shall see that she dies by night.
And I will have Carfax Abbey torn down stone by stone, excavated a mile around.
I will find your earth box and drive that stake through your heart.
Your will is strong, Van Helsing.
More wolfsbane?
More effective than wolfsbane, Count.
Open the windows, Briggs, and let in some air.
The odor in the room from that horrible weed is stifling. I can't stand it.
But the Professor gave orders.
Oh, never mind the Professor now.
Now, please, go back to bed at once. I'm going to call your father.
What is it, Briggs?
Oh, I don't know, Mr. Harker.
I felt strangely dizzy. And when it cleared away, Miss Mina was up and dressed and out on the terrace.
And I can't get her to go to bed.
Well, let me see her. Tell her I'm here.
Oh, John, I'm so glad you're here.
Well, what have they been doing to me, dear?
Locking me in my room. And the horrible smell of that awful weed.
It's been like a nightmare.
What's been the matter?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Mina.
You're so... Like a changed girl.
Oh, you look wonderful.
I feel wonderful. I've never felt better in my life.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you like this.
I've been awfully worried about you.
Mr. Harker. You better bring Miss Mina inside.
That's all right, Briggs, now that I'm here.
Run along, Briggs.
Look, the fog's lifting.
See how plain you can see the stars?
I've never seen them so close.
Why, it looks as if you could reach out and touch them.
Would you like me to get you a hat...
Why, what's the matter?
Come. Let's sit down.
Van Helsing.
Seward, that which I feared from the beginning has happened.
Dracula boasts that he has fused his blood with that of Miss Mina.
In life, she will now become the foul thing of the night that he is.
But Van Helsing...
No, no, come, Seward.
Come, there's not a moment to be lost.
Oh, but I love the fog.
I love nights with fog.
But only yesterday you said you were afraid of the night.
But, darling, I could never have said anything so silly. I couldn't.
I love the night.
That's the only time I feel really alive.
There's that bat again.
Look out. He'll get in your hair.
My, that was a big bat.
Yes, you did. You said, "I will."
Oh, no, I didn't.
John, come.
There must be some way, some way to save her.
- There is only one...
- John. That funny little old professor, he has a crucifix.
Now, I want you to get it away from him and hide it.
But why, dear?
Oh, he'll be wanting to protect me again from the night or Count Dracula or whatever it is.
Well, I don't know. He may be right, Mina.
They look at me so strangely.
Mina, you're...
No, Mina, no!
What's the idea? Have you gone crazy?
What are you trying to do? Frighten her to death?
No, I was trying to save her.
Save her?
That's a fine way.
It's all right, darling.
Oh, John, darling, you must go away from me...
The cross, put it away.
After what's happened, I can't bear to look at it.
I can't tell you.
I can't. Ah, but you must. You must tell me.
You can believe everything he says.
It's all the truth.
Dracula, he...
Well, what's he done to you, dearie?
He opened a vein in his arm and he made me drink...
Who is it, Martin?
It's that big gray bat again, sir.
It's no use of wasting your bullets, Martin.
They cannot harm that bat.
No, sir.
They're all crazy.
They're all crazy, except you and me.
Sometimes I have me doubts about you.
That's Renfield.
What's he doing at the Abbey?
Come, Mr. Harker.
Master! Master, I'm here!
Where else would he be going but to Dracula?
What is it, Master?
Look, here's an opening.
Mina!
I didn't lead them here, Master.
I didn't know. I swear.
Oh, no, don't! Don't kill me!
Let me live, please!
Punish me, torture me, but let me live!
I can't die with all those lives on my conscience!
All that blood on my hands!
Mina! Mina!
He'll kill her if we don't get to her. We must not be too late.
We have him trapped.
Day is breaking. We have him trapped.
He's killing her. Mina!
Mina, where are you?
Mina. Mina.
Harker! Harker!
Yes? Come.
Here. Here, Harker.
I have found them.
Get me a piece of stone, anything. It will help me drive the stake through their hearts.
Is she...
How is she?
Thenâ€œ. Then she may be alive.
John, darling.
I heard you calling, but I couldn't say anything.
We thought he'd killed you, dear.
The daylight stopped him.
Oh, if you could have seen the look on his face.
There's nothing more to fear, Miss Mina.
Dracula is dead forever.
No, no, no. You must go.
But aren't you coming with us?
Not yet, presently. Come, John.
"Adapted From the Novel By Bram Stoker"
"Near Bistritz... the road turns towards the heart of the Carpathians... one of the most barren and least known places in Europe."
What was that, Sara?
"...one of the most barren and least known places in Europe."
"Crumbling castles are scattered among the rugged summits.
They belong to a remote era..."
Coachman, you should go a little slower!
We must get to the inn before nightfall.
Today is Walpurgis Nacht, the night of bad omen.
Nosferatu...
The dead come out from their tombs... and suck the blood of the living.
You would not laugh if you lived here.
Tonight all doors will be locked.
And we shall pray to the Virgin.
How was the trip?
- Well, I am glad to hear it.
Lad, don't take my luggage down.
I must continue on to the Borgo Pass.
I must warn you that today is the day of St. Walpurga... which is considered a bad omen in this area.
And the coachman, who is a good man... wishes to know whether you wouldn't mind... continuing the journey after sunrise.
I am very sorry, but at midnight... a carriage will be waiting for me at the Borgo Pass.
- Whose carriage?
- Count Dracula's.
From Dracula's castle?
That is my destination.
Look, he wants to go tonight to the Borgo Pass.
I beg you to stay the night here.
But all of this is mere superstition.
I mean, in a mountainous area like this one... I do not understand how...
Anyway, what I mean to say is that I am not afraid.
I have already told him that it is a business matter.
I must go there, really.
Since you want to leave... put this on.
Put it on, for your mother's sake.
It will protect you.
And I wish you a good journey.
- Good night and good luck.
Tell me... do you really believe there are vampires... who come out of their tombs and roam about looking for blood?
- I have seen the victims!
Come, Sara.
Count Dracula's carriage?
You have come at the right time.
I have no idea what happened to the coachman and to my luggage.
With all that, I thought I came to the wrong place.
The walls of my castle are cracked.
The shadows are many.
They are the children of the night.
What beautiful music they make!
The eternal fight for survival.
Every living creature needs blood to keep on living.
The spider weaves the web to catch the unwary fly.
The blood is the life, Mr. Renfield.
I think you will find this part of the castle more attractive.
I certainly do.
You are very kind, Count Dracula.
I trust that nobody knows about this visit.
Absolutely nobody, as you recommended.
I assume you have burnt all our correspondence.
I have followed all your instructions to the letter.
Excellent, Mr. Renfield.
Won't you have some?
I never drink... wine.
And now, if you are all right... I would like to talk about the lease of Carfax Abbey.
But all the documents are in my briefcase.
I took the liberty of sending for your luggage.
You just need to sign it.
I hope there are enough tags for all your bags.
I am only taking three boxes.
We shall leave tomorrow night.
I hope you find it comfortable.
It looks appealing.
Now I shall leave you alone.
I may be occupied tomorrow during the day.
In that case, we shall meet here at dusk.
Fingers stiffened on the wheel as if they were frozen.
He must have died of fright.
What a terrible tragedy!
Not even a shred of the sails is left.
It must have been a terrible storm.
What about the sailors?
What became of them?
We have arrived!
Can't you hear me, Master?
- It's coming from that hatchway.
"Crew Of Corpses On Abandoned Ship"
"Ferocious storm believed to be the cause"
"A madman is the only survivor"
"Maritime authorities will deliver... "the shipment to the consignees."
You will tell Dr. Seward, who is sitting in the next box... that there is a phone call for him.
Once you have given him this message... you will not remember anything.
Dr. Seward, there is a phone call for you.
By chance, I heard your name.
Are you the Dr. Seward who has a sanitarium in Whitby?
I have just rented Carfax Abbey.
I understand it is next to the gardens of your sanitarium.
It lies next to my property.
It is a great pleasure to meet you, Count.
Count, allow me to introduce to you my daughter Eva.
Miss Weston.
Mr. Harker.
Count Dracula has just rented Carfax Abbey.
It will be a joy to see those dark windows lit up again.
Count, I beg you to excuse me, there is a phone call for me.
In the meantime, please be seated.
My pleasure.
A pretty house could be built out of those Carfax ruins.
Of course, a lot of money is needed.
I shall barely touch them.
They remind me of the crumbling walls... of my own castle in Transylvania.
What they remind me of is that old toast:
"Lofty beams upon deserted walls... beat with the echo of our laughter... as if the dead whispered through them."
There is something even nicer.
"For those who are already dead let us empty our glasses...
"And let us cheer for the one who must die first."
You can keep the rest to yourself, Lucía.
To really die... to be really dead... must be sublime.
But, Count...
Something worse than death... lies in wait for the living.
You can laugh as much as you want.
I find him fascinating.
Lucía, the romantic girl.
That part about the crumbling walls...
I still prefer someone a little more normal.
- Like Juan?
- Yes, my dear friend, yes.
Like Juan.
Well, Countess, I am very tired.
I leave you with your Count and his crumbling abbey.
May you have sweet dreams.
- The fog is getting thicker.
Another death.
When was the last transfusion performed on Miss Weston?
About four hours before her death.
The same symptoms in each one of the cases.
A baffling loss of blood... that we have been unable to prevent.
Give me the magnifying glass.
And these same two marks were found... on the neck of each of the victims.
Gentlemen... we are dealing with vampires.
- With vampires?
Nosferatu?
Yes, the vampire of Transylvania.
Nosferatu, the vampire.
The vampire attacks his victim on the neck... and leaves two tiny white wounds... with a red dot in the center.
But, Professor Van Helsing, that theory is implausible.
In these times, medical science does not accept... the existence of such a creature.
That is just a myth.
Dr. Seward's patient, Renfield... whose blood I have just analyzed... is obsessed with the idea that he must eat other living creatures... in order to feed his own life.
I am going to England with Dr. Seward to study Renfield's case.
And perhaps I will prove to you... that the superstition of times gone by... may become a scientific truth in our times.
"Seward Sanitarium"
No, don't take it away, Martín!
Don't take it away!
You are a good man. Don't!
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Now, you are interested in spiders. Spiders!
You're no longer content with flies.
Flies?
Wretched flies.
Tiny flies.
Who can be content with flies?
A raving lunatic!
When beautiful and plump spiders are not available... maybe.
All right, do as you please.
But now, come with me.
The Professor wants to talk to you again.
It is a very strange case.
Nevertheless, the only thing Renfield has craved so far... are small bugs.
Not human beings.
That is what we think, Doctor.
But you say that he slips away from his room.
That he's gone for hours.
Well, Mr. Renfield.
You look much better now than when I arrived this morning.
Martín.
I was told that you studied at Oxford University.
I graduated from the School of Law.
In 1927.
I was accepted by the bar in 1928.
Afterwards...
An inferior organism.
Unworthy of my attention.
What would you have done with that fly... had we not been here?
Eat it up.
Tell me, Mr. Renfield... what makes you eat flies?
The wings of flies, sir... represent the aerial power of the psychic faculties.
There is more to this fellow than meets the eye, Doctor.
I have never seen you like this before, Eva.
Are you worried about something?
Have I done something to hurt you?
You haven't done anything, Juan.
But there is something wrong.
I don't know what it could be.
I have been feeling frightened lately.
When the night begins to fall... I get this feeling... that something tightens around me.
Do not touch me with that disgusting device!
Come on, Renfield.
You must let me out of here.
Because I scream at night.
I might bother Miss Eva... and even cause her to have nightmares.
- It sounds like a wolf howling.
- Yes, it sure does.
But I hardly think there are wolves so near London.
He thinks there are.
And I have heard howling at night.
He says that they talk to him.
And he screams back at the top of his voice.
You know very well why the wolves talk.
Isn't that true, Mr. Renfield?
And you also know how to make them stop.
You know too much to go on living!
We won't get another word out of him for the time being.
You can take him away, Martín.
Get up, flycatcher.
I warn you again, Doctor.
If you do not let me go, you will be responsible... for whatever happens to your daughter.
What is that herb that made him so upset?
It's wolfbane.
The peasants in Central Europe use it to drive vampires away.
And Renfield reacted as soon as he smelled it.
He must be closely watched day and night.
You were saying that you had gone to bed.
I was reading and I fell asleep.
I began to dream.
A dog barked.
And it looked as if the whole room filled up with mist.
It was so thick... that I could hardly see the light by my bedside.
It looked like a tiny spark lost amidst the fog.
I saw two red eyes staring at me... and a livid, white face through the fog.
He came closer and closer.
I could feel his breath on my face.
And his lips...
Eva, it was just a dream.
The next morning... I felt very weak, as if all the life had been drained out of me.
When did you have that dream, Miss Eva?
The night... that Father left for Switzerland.
That is to say, the night... after Lucía was buried.
Do you remember anything... that might have caused that nightmare?
There is something troubling Eva, Doctor.
Something she doesn't want to tell us.
And the face that you saw in your dream... you say that it was getting closer and closer?
That the lips touched you?
- What do you have on your neck?
- Please, Father.
How long have you had those marks on your neck?
Since the day after that dream.
Count Dracula is here.
It is a pleasure to see you again, Doctor.
I was sure that you were back.
Miss Seward.
Excuse me, Count Dracula.
This is Professor Van Helsing.
Van Helsing, the distinguished man of science... whose fame is known even in the mountains of Transylvania.
Doctor, I beg you to excuse me... but your daughter had better go to her room immediately.
Aren't you feeling well?
I hope it is nothing serious.
I had a terrible dream a few nights ago... and I have not been able to get it out of my mind.
Perhaps you have taken my stories too seriously?
Stories?
I made a humble effort to entertain your fiancée... by telling her a few of the legends... somewhat gloomy ones... about my distant motherland.
Daughter, I am sure Count Dracula will excuse you.
It is imperative that you go to your room... as Professor Van Helsing has advised you to do.
But, Father, I tell you I'm feeling fine now.
You had better do as your father says.
Good night, my dear daughter.
I must go, Doctor.
Professor Van Helsing... I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again.
Good night, Juan.
I shall come by later to inquire how you're feeling.
- Good night, Miss Seward.
I am very sorry that my visit was so... untimely.
- On the contrary... it may turn out to be of great importance.
Moreover, before you leave, you could be helpful to us.
It will be a pleasure to do whatever I can.
Just a moment ago, I discovered an amazing phenomenon.
Something so incredible that I do not trust my own eyes... and I want you to help me prove it.
Dr. Seward, please accept my apologies.
Considering that you have not yet lived... even a single lifetime... you are a wise man, Professor.
Did you see the expression on his face?
He looked like an enraged beast.
Dracula is our vampire.
For God's sake, Professor.
Vampires cast no reflection in a mirror.
That is why Dracula shattered that mirror.
Look, Professor, that makes no sense whatsoever.
Dracula is the monster who killed Lucía Weston.
The same one who left those marks on Miss Eva's neck.
Well, believe me that I do not wish to offend you... but your words are more like what one of the patients here would say.
And the physicians of this country as well as the police... will believe that very thing.
What gives vampires their power... is that people refuse to believe in them.
But Professor, according to your own theory... the vampire must return to his grave before dawn.
He must return to his native land... which is where he was buried.
Now, Count Dracula's native land is Transylvania.
Then he must have brought the earth with him.
Perhaps in boxes big enough to serve as his bed.
Renfield, what were you doing out there?
Renfield, did you hear what we were saying?
Pay attention to what he is telling you.
That is the only salvation you have left.
And the same is true for her.
Save my soul.
You are sane.
I shall save you.
But you must tell us everything you know.
And I thought you were a wise man.
What do I stand to gain by telling you everything?
That physician keeps me locked up here all day.
And when I behave nicely, he gives me a bit of sugar... so that I can catch flies.
But if I serve the Master...
An intelligent madman would rather serve the one... who can grant him life.
Why mention names among friends, Professor?
What kind of ties do you have with Dracula?
I've never even heard that name before.
Crazy people, Professor... do not have the faculty to distinguish... between what is true and false.
For that reason, I do not take offense.
I begged you to let me out... but you wouldn't do it.
Now it is too late.
It has already happened.
I dare not say it.
I would die in torment if I tried to.
And you shall die in torment... if you let innocent blood stain your soul.
God will not condemn the soul of a poor madman.
He knows very well that the power of evil... is too great for those of us with weak minds... to resist it.
Then, Renfield, trust me.
The name of the creature that has deranged your mind.
The one you call "Master."
Don't ask me that.
Don't ask me that!
You must tell us!
- You must tell us!
Renfield, tell us before it is too late.
Before your soul is damned forever.
I was not going to tell them anything!
I have not told them anything!
I am faithful to you, Master.
I am faithful.
Dr. Seward!
Dr. Seward!
over there... dead.
Thank God, she is still alive.
She is alive, but she is at great risk.
She is under his influence.
Nevertheless, it's true.
We must put an end to it.
We must confront it.
Is Dr. Seward around?
That flycatcher has escaped again... and he's capable of any foolishness.
Dr. Seward and his famous scholar are in the abbey... chasing vampires.
Flycatchers.
Look, Mr. Harker... if there is a brave man after my job, he can have it.
I am going to look for work at another asylum... where the crazy people are nice and reasonable.
Let them think they are Napoleon or kings.
Something worthy of my time.
"The mysterious lady in white... that merciless scourge of childhood... once again played one of her tricks last night... a little after nightfall.
The testimony given by two girls...
Both confirm that it is a beautiful lady... dressed in white... whose modus operandi is to offer... candy to her victim.
She then lures the victim to a deserted corner... where she delicately bites the victim's neck."
What does she know about the lady in white?
Why would she know anything about it?
- She should not have read that.
- For God's sake, Mr. Harker!
And when did you see Lucía again after she was buried?
Once when I was on the terrace.
She came out of the shadows.
She stopped and stared at me.
I began to speak to her.
And then... I remembered... that she was dead.
Her face took on a horrible expression.
Like that of a hungry beast.
As if she were a wolf.
She turned... and disappeared into the fog again.
So the lady dressed in white was...?
Lucía.
Miss, I promise you that from this day on...
Lucía will rest in peace.
Her soul will be forever freed... of that awful appetite.
Since you can save Lucía's soul after her death... promise me that you will save mine, too.
But you're not going to die, my love.
You're going to go on living.
No, no, Juan, you must not touch me.
And you must not kiss me.
Professor, explain it to him.
Juan, it's over between the two of us.
Our love, our wedding plans.
Please, Juan, don't look at me like that.
I love you more than anything else.
But this terrible thing.
He wants it to be this way... and I must obey.
Do you know what you are doing?
You are driving her crazy.
Mr. Harker, you should be worried about what's out there.
The last rays of the sun are gone.
Night hovers over us again.
We have already put wolfbane in this room and in your bedroom... to free you from Dracula, in case he comes back.
She's going to be free of him... because either she returns with me to London or I call the police.
Seward, my friend, I must be in charge here... or whatever I do will be useless.
Miss Eva must keep this branch of wolfbane with her in her bed.
Be careful that she doesn't drop it while she sleeps.
Under no circumstances must those windows be opened during the night.
I understand, Professor.
You have come back, Master.
Are you angry with me?
No, Master!
Dracula's name is associated with a legend... that is still told among his fellow countrymen.
The legend tells of an ancient family... that disappeared over five centuries ago... and was said to be made up of vampires.
One of the undead who has been able... to prolong his life beyond its natural limits... by feeding on the blood of other living creatures.
The only way we can save Eva... is by finding the place... where the living corpse of the vampire rests... and driving a stake through its heart.
What a strange conversation for men who are not crazy.
Renfield, you will force me to put you in a straitjacket.
I am afraid that it will be useless at this point.
What are you saying, Doctor?
I'm on my way, sir.
The doctor's favorite lunatic is at large again.
This barbarian must be Hercules himself.
- What has he done now?
- Come and see for yourself.
From now on... any mental suggestion that you receive from me... must be carried out.
Whenever I want you to do something... it has to be done.
When you come out of this state... you will remember nothing of what I am telling you now.
I have already told you what you must do.
Now... obey.
Renfield, you know where those boxes are.
Tell us and we shall protect you.
But I no longer need your protection.
The Master is not angry with me.
On the contrary, he is pleased.
He came to my window... in the moonlight and promised me things.
Not to say them.
To do them.
- To do them?
To make them happen.
A red mist spread over the lawn... and came towards me like a raging fire.
Then the Master parted the mist... and revealed before my eyes thousands of rats... their eyes inflamed like his own, but smaller.
He raised his hand and they all stopped.
I felt he was telling me:
Thousands, millions of rats!
And in each one of them, a life... full of red blood... promising many years of life.
I shall give you all those beings!
And many more!
For countless generations!
But you have to obey.
What has already been done.
Dracula is in this house.
Where else did you expect him to be?
He will not be able to cause any harm.
We've placed wolfbane in the rooms.
So here you are!
For God's sake! This man is going to drive me crazy.
He twisted and broke the iron bars... as if they were toothpicks.
Come with me, Martín.
Let me show you a place from which he will not escape again.
You may be right, but I still say what St. Thomas said.
And now that you've learned what you've learned... it would be wise to return to your country.
I intend to stay and protect those... you would like to destroy.
Dracula's blood is already flowing in Miss Seward's veins.
She will live for all eternity... as I myself have.
Should you escape, Dracula... we know how to save Miss Eva's soul... if not her life.
Of course I'm all right. I have never felt better... in my whole life.
Tell me... why are you staring at me like that?
You're so...
I can hardly believe it.
You look like a different woman.
Darling, you look terrific.
And I feel terrific.
But it is stuffy in here.
And this smell.
It is the wreath of flowers the professor wanted me to...
Throw away that awful wreath of flowers, will you, Marta?
And please open the windows and let some fresh air in.
But, Miss, the Professor will not approve of that.
Do not worry about him.
It's much nicer out here.
I am glad to see you like this.
I was really worried about you.
I don't know... what was wrong with me.
It's as if... I'm waking from a nightmare.
Juan, the moonlight is beautiful, isn't it?
Have you ever seen so many stars?
Millions and millions.
And they seem to be so close... as if you could reach out and touch them.
Would you like me to offer you a handful of them?
Do not forget, Van Helsing, that over the years... those who crossed my path... paid for it with their lives... and some of them in very unpleasant ways.
Come... here!
You shall not move your hand unless I want you to.
Take out whatever you have in there and put it in this box.
- Have you obeyed me?
- Yes, you told me.
- No, I didn't.
I could have never told you such a foolish thing.
You made it up.
No, you told me that the night frightened you.
And what is there about the night to frighten me?
It's the only time when I feel I'm really alive.
Be careful, a bat!
It may get tangled in your hair.
I thought you did.
God, that bat is huge.
Juan... I want you to promise me something.
Whatever you want, my love.
Whatever you ask.
That strange professor and his herbs... I can't stand them any longer.
Will you do me a favor and take them away from him?
And the crucifix.
Take it away from him, too.
He's say he wants to protect me again.
From the night, from Count Dracula.
From whatever.
I don't know what to believe.
But he might be right.
He told me some terrible things about that Count Dracula.
They look at me in such a strange way.
Eva, my daughter!
It's all right, Eva.
After what's happened, I can't look at it.
But... what's happened?
I cannot tell you!
He opened a vein in his arm... and he forced me... to drink.
Who is it, Martín?
A bat, Professor.
Very big and very black.
Don't waste your pellets.
You'll never harm that bat.
All of them, except me and you.
And sometimes I even have my doubts about you.
It was a good deed... to drive a stake through the heart of that poor girl.
Now her soul will rest in peace.
Let us go to the abbey.
An opening in the wall.
Master, here I am!
He entered through here.
I didn't bring them here, Master!
I have always been faithful!
I did not betray you!
Don't kill me, Master!
Punish me!
Torture me!
But let me live!
I cannot go before God... with so many deaths on my conscience... and so much blood on my hands!
He came in through here!
Use this crowbar, Harker!
Eva, we're here!
His life as a vampire... is coming to its end.
You must be brave.
Find me a stone.
Anything... I can use to drive the stake... through his heart.
Is she...?
She is not here.
Then she is still alive!
You're safe, Eva!
Oh, Juan!
You should have seen the horrible look on his face... when he saw the sunlight.
Dracula is dead forever.
I shall make good on my promise to Renfield.
The Three Penny Opera had its film premiere in Berlin on February 19, 1931.
It was restored in 2006 for the film's 75th anniversary from the original negative in the German Federal Film Archives.
You gents who to a virtuous life would lead us
And turn us from all wrongdoing and sin
First of all see to it that you feed us
Then start your preaching That's where to begin
THE THREEPENNY OPERA
All you who love your paunch and our propriety
There's one thing you must finally realize
No matter how you try to twist and turn it
First comes the grub Then you can moralize
There must first be a chance for all now poorly fed
To get their slice
Of life's great loaf of bread
How does a man survive?
How does a man survive
By daily cheating
Mistreating, beating others Spitting in their face
Only that man survives
Who's able to forget
That he's a member of
The human race
This truth you cannot shirk
Man lives exclusively
By dirty work
Mackie!
The shark has teeth
There they are for all to see
But the knife that Macheath carries
No one knows where it may be
On a blue and balmy Sunday
On the strand a man's lost his life
A man darts round the corner
People call him Mack the Knife
And Schmul Meier
Is still missing
One more wealthy man removed
Somehow Mackie has his money
And yet nothing can be proved
Jenny Towler was discovered
With a knife stuck in her chest
Mackie strolls along the dockside
Knows no more than all the rest
Seven children and an old man
Burned alive in old Soho
In the crowd stands Mack the Knife
Who's not asked and doesn't know
And the widow not yet twenty
She whose name
All could say
Defiled one night as she lay sleeping
Mackie, what price did you pay
Excuse me, ladies. Care to step inside for a drink?
I don't want to be disturbed tonight.
Is Mackie inside?
- How about you and me, Jenny?
- Stop it!
Let the lady go.
Lady?
What lady?
Worry about your own wife! She's gone off with another guy!
Say hi to Mackie for me.
The best dancer in Soho.
Places on the dance floor!
A full bridal outfit.
In brocade.
Orders from the captain.
He's getting married this morning at 10 past 2:00 in warehouse number 3 in the shipyard on the Thames.
Bring the vicar.
A full bridal outfit in brocade.
Complete home furnishings:
A four-poster bed and rugs, and don't forget a grandfather clock.
Deliver this.
Dress properly.
Don't show up looking like this.
I hope this is the last time he gets married.
MR. J. M. BROWN CHIEF OF POLICE, LONDON
Grab it, will ya?
Confound it!
One burglary after another?
A burglary at Selfridge's?
Now that's something!
And nobody was caught?
They all got away?
Is that all you have to report, gentlemen?
You don't know me very well.
I'm not chief of London police for nothing.
Ten burglaries every night and no one's ever caught?
How can I uphold law and order if you let me down like this, gentlemen?
When I think of the upcoming coronation festivities, I could... - If the slightest thing should go wrong... -
...- you'll see a side of me you've never seen before... -
What is it now?
- We caught a burglar red-handed.
You actually... caught a burglar?
You have him here?
Bring him in immediately!
Now, gentlemen, I'll show you how you deal with a fellow like this.
Take your hat off.
You were caught red-handed.
You know this will cost you several years.
You know that in such cases I am ruthless!
...that I am ruthless and unwavering.
Unwavering.
Leave me alone with this man, gentlemen.
What have you... -
Hands up...
if anyone's there!
We can hold the wedding here safe enough.
- Bill Lawgen
- And Mary Syer
Last Wednesday man and wife became
As they stood side by side at city hall
He wondered where she got the gown and all
While she wasn't too sure of his name
You see the moon over Soho?
I see it, dearest.
Do you feel my heart beating, my beloved?
I feel it, my darling.
Wherever you go, I too shall go.
And wherever you are...
I want to be too
And though there's no license from city hall
And no altar covered with flowers fair
And though you may not know where your gown came from
And there's no myrtle in your hair
Take the plate on which you eat your bread
Don't look at it for long Fling it far
Love lasts forever
Or else not at all
No matter where we are
No, no.
Stay a while, Reverend.
Attention, everyone! It's ten past 2:00!
- Congratulations, Polly.
- Congratulations, Captain.
Well, you didn't make much of an effort.
Champagne in wine glasses!
Junk!
Is all this stolen too, Mackie?
Pity we don't have our own place for these nice things.
This is pathetic.
All Scotland Yard was out and about.
And where's the grandfather clock?
No grandfather clock?
My wife is beside herself.
What bunglers!
I'm getting married for once. How often does that happen?
I'm so happy you could be here on the happiest day of our lives.
Reverend, this is Miss Peachum, who loves me and wishes to share her life with me.
Reverend!
Won't you honor us by staying?
I've got... a christening.
Hopefully we'll need you for that pretty quick too.
No dirty jokes in the presence of a lady.
And where's that grandfather clock?
Where's the grandfather clock?
Accompany the reverend.
I do apologize, Reverend. This area's not very safe.
This way, Vicar.
Careful.
I would have preferred it if you hadn't all rushed to the trough.
We could have used a little entertainment.
I'm hungry, Mackie.
Other people always manage that on these occasions.
Will none of you oblige?
Is anyone watching at the door?
Must I see to everything myself?
Gentlemen... if none of you will oblige, I'll offer up a little song myself.
I once thought in my innocent youth
And I once was as innocent as you
Perhaps I too would have a suitor one day
Then I must know what to do
And if he's rich and if he's nice
And if his collar is white as snow
And if he knows how to treat a lady
Then I shall tell him no
Then you hold your head up high
And don't let your feelings show
Sure, the moon will shine all night
But the boat on the river will stay tied up tight
That's as far as you can go
Oh, you can't simply lie back
You must be cold and heartless as you know
Or else all sorts of things
Could happen
Yes, there's just one answer... - no
The first to come along was a man from Kent
He was all that a man should be
The second had three ships in the harbor
And the third was mad about me
And they had money and they were nice
And their collars were white as snow
And they knew how to treat a lady
So I had to tell them
I held my head up high
Didn't let my feelings show
Sure, the moon shone all night
But the boat on the river stayed tied up tight
That's as far as things could go
Or else all sorts of things could happen
Yes, there's just one answer
No
But then one day when the sky was blue
Came a man who didn't bother wooing
He tossed his hat on the peg in my room
And I no longer knew what I was doing
Since he had no money and he wasn't nice
And his collar wasn't white as snow
Since he didn't know how to treat a lady
I couldn't tell him no
I no longer held my head up high
And I let my feelings show
Oh, the moon shone as before
But the boat cast loose and drifted from the shore
That's just how it had to go
Oh, then you must simply lie back
Oh, you can't be cold and heartless, you know
Oh, it simply had to happen
There was no such word as
Very nice!
Funny!
The missus can sure sing a song!
It wasn't "nice," you idiots!
It's not nice, it's art!
That was wonderful, Polly.
Too good for this trash.
Bad news!
It's the sheriff himself!
Hello, Jackie!
Dear old Mackie, couldn't you have done this someplace else?
Did you have to take over somebody's warehouse?
It's burglary, Mackie... - another burglary!
Jackie, I'm delighted you've come to your old frienďs wedding.
My pleasure, my pleasure.
My heartfelt congratulations on this occasion.
Now don't be angry, but I must get back to work.
This is
Tiger Brown.
- Chief of London police.
- Mackie, please!
Where haven't we been together?
India, the Sudan, in a hundred battles.
This is Polly.
The former Miss Peachum.
Peachum?
Did you say Peachum?
Is this old Peachum's daughter?
You're making off with old Peachum's daughter?
That takes courage!
Why courage?
She's the daughter of London's beggar king!
My dear lady, it's been delightful, but I must be going.
Good-bye, Mr. Brown.
Good-bye, Mackie.
I must get back to the office.
The queen's coronation is coming up, and if anything goes wrong, I'll be held responsible.
I shudder to think what could happen to me, so I must be going.
Does Scotland Yard have anything on me in their files?
On you?
Not a thing!
It's all taken care of.
What an awful ladder!
Perhaps next time you might choose a nicer warehouse.
- So that was Tiger Brown?
We have connections with the highest authorities.
Captain, now comes the best part.
- Another little surprise.
Bill Lawgen and Mary Syer
Last Wednesday man and wife became
Three cheers for the happy couple!
You've seen the courtship and marriage of Polly Peachum.
Now I'll show you the power of the beggar king, or as he calls himself,
"the poorest man in London."
Anyone wishing to take up a beggar's trade in London must have a license from Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum Co.
Twenty schillings.
Ten, Mr. Peachum.
Twenty. And 50% of your weekly earnings.
But Mr. Peachum... I have nothing.
Mrs. Peachum!
Number 314. Baker Street district.
Get him some clothes.
Outfit C.
Come along, shorty.
My earnings.
The five basic types of misery guaranteed to move the human heart and induce in a man that unnatural state in which he willingly parts with his money.
Outfit C.
- Can't I have Outfit A?
That's the young man of good family who's seen better days.
But I've seen better days myself.
No one will believe your real suffering.
Complain of a real stomachache and you'll only annoy them.
Enough questions.
Please forgive me.
Hurry it up, shorty.
I can't stand here holding your trousers till Christmas.
P-p-please,
I have money for a new co-co-co... -
Tell Polly to come down right away.
How many times have I told you that a gentleman must have freshly laundered rags?
Holes are to be burned in and stains made with candle wax.
Those with means to pay are entitled to a uniform that ensures the pity of their clients.
Your share of my take.
- With this stump?
I'm lodging a complaint!
This place is a pigsty, and this is a lousy stump!
There, my friend.
Now you can go work for a living.
Mr. Peachum!
Thugs!
...a new co-co-costume!
I'll get her myself!
Let her sleep!
- Sleep? At this hour?
Polly didn't come home?
G-g-good... m-m-morning!
A cane with an ivory handle?
Mack the Knife!
Dear God!
Crook's trollop!
Help me undress.
You'll divorce him!
How can I divorce him?
I'll tan your behind!
It won't do any good.
Love is greater than a tanned behind.
That's what we get for spoiling her with dresses, hats, gloves, and parasols!
Mack the Knife!
My honest business and a common crook!
Hanging him's the only solution.
Hanging him?
You and your ideas.
Turn him in to the police.
- I don't know where he is!
- I do.
With his whores in Turnbridge Alley.
I'm very sorry, but there's nothing the police can do.
There's nothing the police can do?
Then what's going to happen to you will be a horrible injustice.
If you don't catch Mack the Knife and hang him, there'll be a scandal at the queen's coronation that will cost you your job.
An army of filthy beggars will march up to greet the queen.
When they gather before the church by the thousands, it won't be a festive sight.
They're not an attractive crowd.
Not an attractive crowd, eh?
Well, I'll have them run off!
I'll force them to... -
How will it look at the coronation if 2,000 poor cripples must be beaten to the ground?
It will look very bad, Mr. Brown.
A revolting sight.
You're... you're threatening me!
I'll have you taken away, Mr. Peachum!
Where's my bell?
I'll call to have you taken away if you're ever so impertinent... again.
I'm just a poor man, Mr. Brown.
Look here, Mr. Peachum:
We're all poor men here.
Come, my dear, poor Mr. Peachum.
I'm sure you understand you can only hang a man if you have the man.
You can only arrest a man if you have him.
I can tell you where he is.
A mother-in-law ought to know where her son-in-law can be arrested.
With the ladies in Turnbridge Alley.
The whores in Turnbridge Alley!
What's that?
A man lives by his head
He needs a larger size
Just try it for yourself Your head
Won't feed a pair of lice
You see, for this existence
Man is never sharp enough
Hence his weak resistance
To its tricks and bluff
So make your little plan
Yes, be a shining light
Then make yourself a second plan
None will turn out right
You see, for this existence
There's no man who's bad enough
Still it's nice to watch them
Trying to be tough
Sure, chase your bit of luck
But no need to run fast
Though men always race after it
Luck always runs last
You see, for this existence
Man's demands are just too tough
All his noisy striving
Is self-deluding guff
Item No. 8. Regarding the safes on Oak Street... only cash is to be taken.
No securities.
Yeah, we're not getting involved in stock fraud.
Jimmy Two... will take command of the explosives convoy.
If he's bumped off, no great loss.
He doesn't bring much in anymore.
You're one to talk.
Just a minute.
Three, four, five gold watches was your take this month.
Not much.
Item No. 9.
Time of the burglary:
8:30, during the coronation celebration.
- Guards will all be at the ceremony.
- And all plastered.
The job's a cinch.
What's the matter?
- You must pack right away. - Nonsense!
What's the matter?
You must leave immediately!
I went to see Tiger Brown, and my father was there too.
They plan to arrest you.
You must pack immediately!
Come here, Polly.
There's something I'd rather do than pack.
No, Mackie. Not now.
Brown stood up for you at first, but then he gave in.
Now he says to tell you... -
There's nothing more he can do for you.
Come now!
I can trust Brown implicitly.
Scotland Yard has nothing on me.
Maybe they didn't yesterday, but today they've suddenly got a whole lot on you.
In Winchester you seduced two sisters, both of them minors.
They told me they were over 30.
Both of them together.
Your father's a fine one.
Is this the thanks I get for marrying his daughter?
If I must go, you'll have to take over running the business.
Gentlemen... I must unfortunately take a little trip.
Now, with the coronation coming up?
Without you, it's like soup without a spoon!
I'm therefore temporarily entrusting management of the business to my wife.
A woman?
What about the big bank job?
Shut your trap!
Now, if the bank job goes well, then it's no more picking pockets and street muggings.
It's good-bye to Soho and hello to the big city!
Good-bye, you poor fools.
Good-bye, Captain!
Mackie, don't tear my heart out.
Stay here with me, and let's be happy.
I'm tearing my own heart out, because I must go away, and no one knows when I'll return.
It lasted so short a time.
Is it over then?
Don't forget me, Mackie, in foreign parts.
I won't forget you, Polly.
Kiss me, Polly.
And don't go to those ladies in Turnbridge.
Farewell, Polly.
Farewell, Mackie.
I'm in charge now.
Gentlemen... I think our captain can depart in full confidence.
We'll pull off that job just fine, won't we, gentlemen?
In first-class style.
Isn't that right... gentlemen?
Well, it's not for me to say, but I'm not sure that at a time like this, a woman is the right man.
Nothing personal, ma'am.
The swine!
You bet it was nothing personal!
Or else the others would have tanned your hide!
Right, gentlemen?
Nothing personal, of course.
She packs a punch, believe me.
Splendid! Our lady captain knows how to find the right word!
Bravo, Polly!
From now on we'll settle accounts every Thursday, gentlemen.
Dismissed.
Jenny, there's someone here to see you.
- Isn't that lovely!
- The queen's coronation gown?
It cost 7,000 pounds.
Imagine the fine underwear a queen can afford.
Why would a queen need fine underwear anyway?
I wonder if Mackie will come by today.
I don't think he'll ever be back.
WANTED! £100 REWARD FOR MACK THE KNIFE
He took away my daughter. Married her, he did!
Married her?
Last night. Married her good and proper.
So if he comes here today, will you signal from the window?
Hey, there!
My coffee!
I'll signal.
Good heavens, Mackie!
Quickly, now! Mon café
- Haven't you seen the wanted posters?
But Thursday's my day here.
I can't let such trifles disturb my routine.
Congratulations on your marriage.
Too bad you missed it.
It was A-1.
Jenny, come join us.
Yes, Jenny... come on.
Jenny, read his palm!
Jenny, why that look?
Just good news, please.
Nothing bad.
Mackie... when the coronation bells ring at Westminster, you'll be in a bad way.
My hat and cane.
My jacket!
- Stay, Mackie.
- Who knows when you'll be back.
You can count on it.
Gents, you see me washing the glasses
And making your beds without squawking
And you tip me a penny and I thank you well
And you see my dirty rags in this ratty old hotel
And you don't know to whom you're talking
But one day there'll be a shout at the dock
And they'll ask "What was that shout?"
And they'll see me smiling as I wash my glasses
And they'll ask "What's she smiling about?"
And a ship
With eight sails
And 50 cannon
Will be at the quay
Gentlemen, your laughter will quickly stop
As walls tumble down everywhere
The third day will see the town razed to the ground
Just one ratty old hotel will survive safe and sound
And they'll ask "Who's so special that lives there?"
And that night a cry will go up around the hotel
Folks will ask "Why was this hotel spared?"
And at dawn they'll see me coming through the doorway
And they'll say "So she lived in there!"
Will lay siege to the town
A hundred men will land in the bright midday sun
And stealthily step through the shadows
They'll enter every doorway Grab every man they see
And clap them in chains and bring them to me
And ask me "Which shall we kill?"
That noon there'll be quiet in the harbor
As they ask me "Who is to die?"
And then they'll hear my reply
"All of 'em!"
And as each head falls I'll say
"Hoppla!"
And the ship
With eight sails
Will vanish with me
Jenny, you remember the days before my star rose over this town?
Even though I'm now Mack the Knife, I'll never forget you, Jenny.
What more can a gentleman say?
Mackie, you must flee!
You've been betrayed!
Is there still just one way out of this rattrap?
He went out the window!
You were in quite a hurry just now.
I hadn't yet had the pleasure.
Is there someone waiting for you?
She can wait.
I live just over there.
What is it now?
Never mind! Come on!
Peachum!
He got away!
His girls helped him escape!
His girls!
Brown is the "girl" in question.
Tiger Brown let his friend get away.
Well, Mr. Brown has "out-Browned" himself.
It's time we start thinking about the coronation parade.
We only just met, and you're already leaving.
Goes with the profession.
Busy, busy, busy.
No long speeches.
I'm all yours, gentlemen.
You've seen Mackie's bold and reckless nature.
I'll now show you how, through a loving wife's cleverness, things take a turn that even you wouldn't expect.
The gentlemen of the board.
Gentlemen of the board... one can rob a bank, or one can... Use a bank to rob others.
...tread the path of a respectable and law-abiding business... as my papa so often told me.
"Polly," he always said,
"Who'd be so stupid as to be a burglar these days when we've got laws?"
And though my husband... - I mean, our most esteemed managing director... - must hide like a fugitive in foreign parts,
I'm certain he would approve of how we pulled this off!
We bought this quiet, elegant little bank... which will be more profitable than finding a few puny safes... - To rifle.
Now we'll really get down to business!
Bravo!
Thank you, gentlemen.
I'd just like to add that our firm can only employ top-quality people.
Street muggings and pickpocketing are for idiots!
Forget the romance of the past!
Life begins in earnest now.
Whoever can't rise to the challenge will be terminated forthwith without remuneration.
You can learn a thing or two from her.
This way, Mr. Brown.
Would you like to see him?
- No... for Goďs sake.
Handle it yourself, please.
Smith... give him something to eat.
A decent meal.
Wine.
Cigarettes too?
Of course!
Wait! He only smokes cigars.
Give him these.
He won't have time to smoke many more.
Hello, Mackie.
Hello, Smith.
Did Brown have any news for me?
He's very distraught, and just when the coronation parade's coming up.
I say, Smith... you couldn't find any heavier handcuffs?
With your kind permission, I'd like a more comfortable pair.
Well, we have them in every price range, from one guinea to ten.
All depends on how much you wish to spend.
How much for none at all?
Fifty.
Now, what would you like to eat, Captain?
What have you got in the canteen?
No, no prison fare for you.
If you'd like, I'll get it from... -
My last supper, eh?
There, Captain.
Now you can move about freely again.
That's for someone else, Captain.
So, Captain, what would you like for dinner?
Leave it to me if you'd like.
The gentlemen here have always been most satisfied.
DO NOT TURN A DEAF EAR TO MISFORTUNE
Yes, I'll send them right away.
- Group 3 is ready.
- Off you go!
Filch speaking.
The 10th district is ready.
They're to join the fourth at Nelson's Column at 8:00 a.m.
But we've got real cripples. How can we make it by 8:00?
You must.
VICTIM OF MILITARY DESPOTISM
The ugliest are to march on the outside... so the noble gentlemen will have a pretty sight to look at.
The royal guard is presenting arms.
They'll ride right over us!
You've got slingshots.
- What if they shoot?
- Gentlemen!
Gentlemen... at this very moment, 1,432 of your colleagues are marching to pay their respects to the queen.
For I've shown that the rich of this world have no qualms about causing misery but can't bear the sight of it!
They have hard hearts but weak nerves.
Well, we won't spare their nerves today!
By the thousands we'll tear at their nerves, for our rags do not conceal our wounds!
Gentlemen... do not be afraid!
The queen will not allow cripples to be attacked with bayonets!
Stop, Peachum!
Mackie's become a bank president!
Call your people back!
Our Polly's a guest of honor in the stands.
Back, all of you!
Come to your senses!
Listen to reason!
I repeat: We must have the remaining £3,000 in cash now!
Without fail!
Nervous, gentlemen?
Well, I'm very calm.
But Tiger Brown, our best friend, had him arrested!
That must mean something.
We must get £10,000 in bail to the police chief.
I'll take it!
There's turmoil in the streets.
That's why I'm giving it to our bank's trustworthy servant.
Why aren't you at the stock exchange?
Using force is pointless!
They'll shoot you down!
You're marching to your own destruction!
No visitors allowed here!
Smith, let me go in.
Jenny, I can't be responsible if anyone should see you.
Smith, darling, I'll only be a second.
I have to see that despicable scoundrel once more.
Mackie and I were close once.
- I know... -
Smith, sweetie, you can come see me tonight.
I really shouldn't!
This slut is all I need now.
- Enjoy your meal, Captain.
- My meal?
No time to put on your face, eh?
You dirty skunk!
How can you even look at me, after all that's happened!
Quiet, you stupid hussy!
Think I don't know about Suky Tawdry?
Dinner's served, Captain.
Stop that now!
You'll drive the man crazy!
Ah, Smith, my darling, I love you so.
I'd rather see him on the gallows than in the arms of another.
Oh, Smith, you're such a darling, such a fine, upstanding man.
Jenny, let go!
No, I won't!
GIVE AND THOU SHALT RECEIVE
More than 300 beggars are marching towards Piccadilly.
Disperse them!
They broke through the barrier at Baker Street.
The procession's been completely obstructed.
- Arrest them!
- Arrest them all!
Disperse them!
Use clubs if necessary!
Use your clubs! That's right!
No, you idiot!
They can't club thousands of beggars to the ground... - and on Coronation Day!
You can't be serious!
- I have bail for Mack the Knife.
What do you have?
Bail. For Mack the Knife.
Mackie?
I mean, Mack the Knife?
Get me Division C, now!
Brown speaking.
Mack the Knife is to be released immediately.
Mack... has... escaped?
Now you can go.
Confiscated goods.
Going to the coronation, Captain?
Shut your trap!
I just busted out of jail!
Busted out?
We sent over bail from City Bank for you, our director.
I just told you I busted out!
£10,000 shot to hell!
What filthy Soho sewer is my office in now?
What Soho sewer?
City Bank! Piccadilly!
Best part of town! What?
Piccadilly?
City Bank? A real bank?
An honest-to-goodness bank!
Take the first right, then the third left.
If you see cops, keep to the left!
No, not right!
They were all after you like bloodhounds.
Did you remember to pretty yourself up every day just as if I'd been here?
All I see are your lips.
I don't hear a word you're saying.
Were you faithful to me too?
You're looking good, Polly.
I'm very pleased with you.
Have you seen the mail yet?
Mackie, don't talk business now.
Kiss your little Polly and swear that you'll never, ever... -
We'd better get dressed.
The coronation celebrations have begun.
The police barrier's broken!
The coronation parade's breaking up!
Crowds of beggars at Westminster!
Pull the shades!
Mackie, I'm ruined.
I'll be sacked!
My days as police chief are over!
Don't worry.
You've come to the right place.
You'll make a great bank director.
How much capital would you like to invest?
Capital?
£10,000!
His bail.
I salvaged it.
Hear that, nitwits?
There's a lesson there.
Come along, you old battleship.
Full steam ahead for my whiskey bottle.
Polly... gentlemen... before you stands a man whom the king, in his unfathomable wisdom, elevated high above his fellow men.
And yet this man remained my friend through every storm, and so forth and so on.
But fate moves in mysterious ways.
You all know what I mean.
Today this man comes to me, Mack the Knife, as one friend to another.
There's a lesson there.
Do you remember when you and I were soldiers and served in the army in India?
Yes, Jackie.
Those were the days!
John was there and Jim was too
And Georgie made sergeant in short order
The army doesn't give a fig who you are
And they marched us north to the border
Soldiers live under the cannon's thunder
From the Cape to Cooch Behar
If it should rain one night
And they should chance to sight
- An unfamiliar race
- Dark or fair of face
They might just chop them up to make their steak tartare
- Johnny's whiskey was too warm
- And Jimmy thought he'd freeze
- Georgie took them by the arm
- Saying, "Don't desert us, please"
They just might chop them up to make their steak tartare
John is buried and Jimmy's dead
And they shot poor Georgie for looting
But blood is still blood-red
And the army's still recruiting
Soldiers live under the cannon's thunder
If it should rain one night
And they should chance to sight
An unfamiliar race
Dark or fair of face
They might just chop them up to make their steak tartare
The poorest man in London and the wealthy Mack the Knife... - shouldn't they join forces?
The poorest man in London is now bankrupt, my dear Peachum, and is just another poor devil.
Today of all days showed me the power of the poor.
With your money and my experience, we can do business, more business than you could ever imagine.
If the poor are so powerful, why do they need us?
Because they don't know that we need them.
Gathered for the happy ending
All and sundry pool their might
When the needed funds are handy
Things will usually turn out right
Though a man will fight his rival
To fish the muddy depths
In the end they'll dine together
And consume the poor man's bread
For some men live in darkness
While others stand in the light
We see those in the light
While the others fade from sight
Mr Carl Laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning.
We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein. A man of science, who sought to create a man after his own image, without reckoning upon God.
It is one of the strangest tales ever told.
It deals with the two great mysteries of creation:
Life and death.
I think it will thrill you.
It may shock you.
It might even horrify you.
So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now is your chance to, er...
Well, we've warned you.
Down, you fool!
Hurry, hurry.
The moon's rising. We've no time to lose.
He's just resting. Waiting for a new life to come.
Look, it's still here.
Climb up and cut the rope.
- Go on. It can't hurt you.
Here's a knife.
Here's the knife.
Here I come.
Is it all right?
The neck's broken.
The brain is useless!
We must find another brain.
That'll do, gentlemen.
And in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, here we have one of the most perfect specimens of the human brain ever to come to my attention at the university.
And here, the abnormal brain of the typical criminal.
Observe, ladies and gentlemen, the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe as compared to that of the normal brain, and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe.
All of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the history of the dead man before us, whose life was one of brutality, of violence and murder.
These jars will remain here for your further inspection.
Thank you, gentlemen. The class is dismissed.
Herr Victor Moritz.
- I'm so glad you've come.
- What is it, Elizabeth?
- Oh, you've heard from Henry.
- Yes. The first word in four months.
It just came.
- Victor, you must help me.
- Of course I'll help you.
I've read this over and over again, but they're just words that I can't understand.
"You must have faith in me, Elizabeth.
Wait."
"My work must come first, even before you."
"At night, the winds howl in the mountains."
"There is no one here."
"Prying eyes can't peer into my secret."
- What can he mean?
- What does he say then?
"I am living in an abandoned watchtower close to the town of Goldstadt."
"Only my assistant is here to help me with my experiments."
His experiments.
- Yes, that's what frightens me.
The day we announced our engagement, he told me of his experiments.
He said he was close to a discovery so terrific that he doubted his own sanity.
There was a strange look in his eyes.
Some mystery.
His words carried me right away.
Of course, I've never doubted him. But still, I worry. I can't help it.
And now this letter.
All this uncertainty can't go on. I must know.
Victor, have you seen him?
Yes. About three weeks ago.
I met him walking alone in the woods.
He spoke to me of his work, too.
I asked him if I might visit his laboratory.
He just glared at me and said he would let no one go there.
- His manner was very strange.
- Oh, what can we do?
- If he should be ill!
- Now, don't worry.
I'll go to Dr Waldman, Henry's old professor in medical school.
Perhaps he can tell me more about all this.
Victor, you're a dear.
You know I'd go to the ends of the earth for you.
I shouldn't like that. I'm far too fond of you.
I wish you were.
Good night, Victor. And thank you.
Good night. And don't worry.
- You can't!
I must.
I'll be ready in a minute.
Herr Frankenstein is a most brilliant young man, yet so erratic.
He troubles me.
I'm worried about Henry.
Why has he left the university?
He was doing so well and he seemed so happy with his work.
You know, his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electrobiology were far in advance of our theories here at the university.
In fact, they had reached a most advanced stage.
They were becoming dangerous.
Herr Frankenstein is greatly changed.
You mean changed as a result of his work?
Yes. His work.
His insane ambition to create life.
How? How?
Please tell us everything, whatever it is.
The bodies we use now, dissecting them for lecture purposes, were not perfect enough for his experiments, he said.
He wished us to supply him with other bodies, and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them.
I told him that his demands were unreasonable, and so he left the university to work unhampered.
- He found what he needed elsewhere. - Oh.
The bodies of animals.
Well, what are the lives of a few rabbits and dogs?
You do not quite get what I mean.
Herr Frankenstein was interested only in human life.
First to destroy it, then re-create it.
There you have his mad dream.
- Can we go to him?
- You will not be very welcome.
What does that matter?
I must see him.
Dr Waldman, you have influence with Henry.
Won't you come with us?
I'm sorry, but Herr Frankenstein is no longer my pupil.
But he respects you.
Won't you help us to take him away?
Very well, Fraulein. I've warned you.
But if you wish it, I will go.
- Fritz!
- Hello.
- Have you finished those connections? - Yes, they're done.
Well, come down, then, and help.
We've lots to do.
If this storm develops as I hope, you will have plenty to be afraid of before the night's over.
Go on, fix the electrodes.
This storm will be magnificent.
All the electrical secrets of heaven.
And this time we're ready.
Hey, Fritz?
- Why, what's the matter?
No blood, no decay.
Just a few stitches.
And look.
Here's the final touch.
- The brain you stole, Fritz. - Yes.
Think of it - the brain of a dead man waiting to live again in a body I made with my own hands.
Let's have one final test.
Throw the switches.
In 15 minutes, the storm should be at its height.
Then we'll be ready.
- There's someone there.
- Shh! Quiet.
Send them away!
Nobody must come here.
Here.
Whoever it is, don't let them in.
Leave them to me.
Of all the times for anybody to come! Now!
I'll show them, messing about at this time of night. Got too much to do.
- Wait a minute!
All right, all right!
Wait a minute, I'm coming.
- It's Dr Waldman, Fritz.
- You can't see him.
All right, knock!
- Henry! - Frankenstein!
- Henry! - Frankenstein!
- Let us in!
You must leave me alone now.
It's Elizabeth!
- Frankenstein!
- You must leave me alone.
- At least give us shelter.
- What's this nonsense of locked doors?
Elizabeth, please, won't you go away?
Won't you trust me just for tonight?
- You're ill.
- Nothing. I'm quite all right.
Can't you see I mustn't be disturbed?
My experiment is almost completed.
I believe in you. But I cannot leave you tonight.
- You've got to leave!
- Henry, you're inhuman.
Crazy, am I?
We'll see whether I'm crazy or not.
You're quite sure you want to come in?
Forgive me, but I'm forced to take unusual precautions.
You too, Elizabeth.
A moment ago, you said I was crazy.
- Tomorrow, we'll see about that.
- Don't touch that!
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I insist.
Doctor Waldman, I learnt a great deal from you at the university about the violet ray, the ultraviolet ray, which you said was the highest colour in the spectrum.
Here, in this machinery, I have gone beyond that.
I have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world.
And your proof?
Tonight you shall have your proof.
At first I experimented only with dead animals, and then a human heart, which I kept beating for three weeks.
But now I'm going to turn that ray on that body, and endow it with life.
And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead?
That body is not dead.
It has never lived.
I created it. I made it with my own hands from the bodies I took from graves, from the gallows, anywhere.
Go and see for yourself.
Dead, hey?
Quite a good scene, isn't it?
One man crazy, three very sane spectators.
Test the batteries.
It's moving.
It's alive.
It's alive!
It's alive. It's moving.
It's alive! It's alive!
It's alive!
- It's alive!
- Henry, in the name of God!
In the name of God? !
Now I know what it feels to be God.
Henry is well, but he's very busy.
He said he would get in touch with you soon.
Don't worry about him, Baron. He'll be home in a few days.
You two have it all arranged, haven't you?
You think I'm an idiot, don't you?
Anyone can see with half an eye that there's something wrong.
And I've two eyes, and pretty good ones at that.
- You're quite mistaken, Baron.
What's the matter with my son?
He's completing his experiments.
Would you tell me that?
- Baron, you don't understand.
- I understand perfectly well.
There's another woman, and you're afraid to tell me.
Pretty sordid experiments these must be. Huh!
- Oh, but you're wrong!
- And how do you know?
If you please, Herr Baron, the burgomaster.
- Well, tell him to go away.
- But he says it's important.
Nothing the burgomaster can say can be of the slightest importance.
Good day, Herr Baron.
If it's trouble, go away.
I've trouble enough.
- Oh, there's no trouble, sir.
- What do you mean, "no trouble"?
There's nothing but trouble.
- I brought you these flowers.
- Thank you, Herr Vogel.
Both in my private and official capacities as burgomaster...
Yes, yes, yes, we know all about that, but what do you want?
What I really want to know is when will the wedding be, if you please.
Unless Henry comes to his senses, there'll be no wedding at all.
- But the village is already prepared.
- Well, tell them to unprepare.
But such a lovely bride...
Such a fine young man, the very image of his father.
- Heaven forbid.
- But, sir, everything is ready!
I know that! Don't keep on saying so, you idiot!
There's nothing to cry about.
Good day, Miss Elizabeth.
Good day, Herr Moritz.
Good day, Herr Vogel.
Good day, Herr Baron.
And good riddance to you.
There you are. Huh! You see how it is.
The whole village is kept waiting, the bride is kept waiting, and I am kept waiting.
Henry must come home, if I have to fetch him myself.
No, no, Baron.
What about his work?
What about his wedding?
There is another woman... and I'm going to find her.
Come and sit down, Doctor.
Do you expect perfection at once?
This creature of yours should be kept under guard.
Mark my words, he will prove dangerous.
Poor old Waldman.
Have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous?
Where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond?
Have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars?
Or to know what causes the trees to bud?
And what changes the darkness into light?
But if you talk like that... people call you crazy.
Well, if I could discover just one of these things - what eternity is, for example - I wouldn't care if they did think I was crazy.
You're young, my friend.
Your success has intoxicated you.
Wake up and look facts in the face!
Here we have a fiend whose brain...
Whose brain must be given time to develop.
It's a perfectly good brain, Doctor.
Well, you ought to know. It came from your own laboratory.
The brain that was stolen from my laboratory was a criminal brain.
Oh, well.
After all, it's only a piece of dead tissue.
Only evil can come of it.
Your health will be ruined if you persist in this madness.
I'm astonishingly sane, Doctor.
You have created a monster and it will destroy you.
Patience, patience.
I believe in this monster, as you call it.
And if you don't, well, you must leave me alone.
But think of Elizabeth. Your father.
Elizabeth believes in me.
My father? He never believes in anyone.
I've got to experiment further.
He's only a few days old, remember.
So far, he's been kept in complete darkness.
Wait till I bring him into the light.
Let's turn out the light.
It understands.
Take care now, Frankenstein.
Shut out the light.
- It understands this time.
It's wonderful.
- Frankenstein, where is it? !
Quiet, you fool!
Get away with that torch.
- Aagh! - Quick!
Fetch the rope, quick.
Stop pushing.
- Get him to the cellar.
- Shoot it! It's a monster.
Quiet. Quiet!
Stop that! You'll have the whole countryside on us!
Come away. He has the strength of ten men!
Here, give me that!
Come away, Fritz.
Leave it alone.
What's that? Who's there?
It's Fritz!
Come on, Doctor. Quick, hurry.
Come on, quickly.
He hated Fritz. Fritz always tormented him.
Come, pull yourself together.
- Kill it, as you would any savage animal.
We must overpower him first.
Get me a hypodermic needle.
- It's murder.
- It's our only chance.
In a few minutes, he'll be through that door.
Come, quick. Hurry.
- Got it?
- Yes, here it is.
- It's very strong.
Half-grain solution.
Now then.
You stand there.
When he goes toward you, I will make the injection in his back.
Dr Waldman. Dr Waldman!
- No, I'm all right. It's nothing.
See who's at the door.
Elizabeth and your father are coming to see you.
- Keep them out.
They must not see that.
Here, quick, give me a hand.
Henry, hurry, get that blood off your face before your father and Elizabeth get here.
Pretty sort of place for my son to be in, I must say.
- Is that the front door? - Yes, this is it.
I don't like it, but... here goes.
There doesn't seem to be anybody in the place.
What a... What a forsaken place.
Are you trying to burn it down, eh?
What's that for, eh?
Well, what's the matter with you?
You look as if you've been kicked by a horse.
- Where's Henry? - Why...
- He can't be disturbed just now.
Oh, can't he?
Huh! I'll soon settle that nonsense.
Victor, where is he?
This place seems to drive everybody crazy.
- Oh, heavens...
I beg your pardon. I am Dr Waldman.
Oh, are you?
I'm Baron Frankenstein.
Perhaps you know what all this tommyrot's about.
I... I'll be shot if I do!
I advise you to take Henry away from here at once.
Well, what do you suppose I'm here for? Pleasure?
Where are you, my dear?
Let's see what's up the awful stairs.
I don't know how the deuce I'm going to get up 'em, but...
Leave them alone.
No banisters or anything else...
How much further?
Victor! Dr Waldman! Come quickly.
- My dear, what have they done to you?
- Poor Fritz...
It's all my fault...
Get him on the sofa.
Have you got any brandy?
Quick, quick, quick.
Here, I'll do that.
My boy... Now, now...
There, that's better.
I'm going to take you home with me, Henry.
No, I can't. My work.
What will happen to the records of my experiment?
- We will preserve them.
I will see that it is painlessly destroyed.
Yes, yes. Leave it all to me.
Poor Fritz.
All my fault.
There, Henry. You can't do any more now.
You must come home until you get well again.
You'll soon feel better when you get out of here.
It's like heaven being with you again.
Heaven wasn't so far away all the time, you know.
I know. But I didn't realise it.
Those horrible days and nights.
Henry, you're not to think of those things any more.
- You promised.
Let's think about us.
When will our wedding be?
Let's make it soon.
As soon as you like.
For three generations, these orange blossoms have been worn at our weddings.
Your great-grandfather wore this, Henry.
Looks as good as new now, hey?
And here. Here is one to make the best man look still better.
30 years ago, I placed this on your mother's head, Henry.
Today, you'll make me very happy by doing the same for Elizabeth.
And I hope, in 30 years' time, a youngster of yours will be carrying on the tradition.
And now, how about a little drink, eh?
My grandfather bought this wine and laid it down.
My grandmother wouldn't let him drink it. Bless her heart.
Here's to your very good health.
Well, are you all full? Yes?
Here's a health to a son of the House of Frankenstein.
A son to the House of Frankenstein.
Here's a jolly good health to young Frankenstein.
Young Frankenstein.
Give the servants some champagne.
This stuff's wasted on 'em.
Go on, mop it up.
- House of Frankenstein.
- To the House of Frankenstein.
Now then. Now be off about your business.
- Listen!
Listen to 'em!
The boys and girls of the village are out here.
It's extraordinary how friendly you can make a lot of people on a couple of bottles of beer.
Tomorrow they'll all be fighting.
No doubt!
- They're calling for you, Baron. - Hey-ho.
Well, I suppose I'd better show myself.
Thank you all very much indeed.
I'm very pleased to see you all, and I hope there's plenty of beer.
There's lots more where that came from.
You stay here, Maria. I'll just take a look at my traps. Then we'll go to the village and have a grand time, huh?
- You won't be long, Daddy?
If Franz comes by, tell him I'll be back soon.
Daddy, won't you stay and play with me a little while?
I'm too busy, darling.
You stay and play with the kitty, huh?
- Bye, Daddy. - Goodbye.
Be a good girl now.
I'm Maria.
Would you like one of my flowers?
You have those, and I'll have these.
I can make a boat.
See how mine float?
No, you're hurting me!
How lovely you look.
But you shouldn't be here.
I must see you for a minute.
Could you leave us for a moment?
- I'm so glad you're safe.
Safe? Of course I'm safe.
But you look worried.
No, forget my foolishness.
It was just a mood.
There's nothing the matter.
Of course there isn't!
Henry, I'm afraid.
Terribly afraid.
Where is Dr Waldman? Why is he late for the wedding?
He's always late.
Something is going to happen.
I can't get it out of my mind.
You're just nervous.
All the excitement and preparation.
No. No, it isn't that.
I've felt it all day.
Something is coming between us.
I know it. I know it!
Sit down and rest. You look so tired.
- If I could just save us from it.
- From what, dear? From what?
If I could just get it out of my mind!
I'd die if I had to lose you now, Henry.
Why, I'll always be with you.
Will you, Henry?
I love you so.
How beautiful you look.
Henry! Henry!
Dr Waldman!
- What about Dr Waldman?
- Henry, don't leave me!
- No, darling, you stay here.
- Henry! Henry!
Dr Waldman's been murdered in the tower.
The monster. He's been seen in the hills, terrorising the mountainside.
He's in the house.
He's upstairs!
It's in the cellars.
It's Elizabeth!
- Don't let him come here. - No, no, no, darling.
It's all right.
- Don't let him come here. - It's all right, darling.
Oh, look! That's Maria!
She's drowned.
My poor man. Why do you bring her here to me?
But... But she has been murdered.
I'll see that justice is done.
- How is Elizabeth now?
She's still in a daze. Just looks at me and says nothing. It's maddening.
Easy, old man.
- Our wedding day. - Steady.
Your wedding will be postponed a day at most.
- A day? I wonder.
There can be no wedding while this horrible creation of mine is still alive.
I made him with these hands, and with these hands I will destroy him.
- I must find him!
No. You stay here and look after Elizabeth.
I'll leave her in your care, whatever happens.
In your care.
Ludwig. You will search the woods. Those are your group.
- We'll get him!
Herr Frankenstein. You will take to the mountains.
Those are your people.
I... I will lead the third group by the lake.
And remember... remember... get him alive if you can, but get him!
Search every ravine, every crevasse, but the fiend must be found!
Light your torches and go!
Frankenstein, mountains!
Lake party, this way!
Come on, boys! Keep together.
You search there.
The rest, come with me.
Look lively!
Herr Frankenstein! Herr Frankenstein!
Come on, men!
Quick! This way!
Which way did he go? Which way did he go? Tell me!
You stay here and take care of him.
The rest, follow me. Come on!
Herr Frankenstein!
Herr Frankenstein, where are you?
I think he's up there.
Come on, follow me.
Fire. Fire!
- Listen.
Come on, hurry! Hurry!
Look, they're there!
Turn the hounds loose!
The murderer.
Bring him down to the village and let's take him home.
Burn the mill!
He can't get away!
Come on, hurry.
Quiet, quiet.
Well, go ahead and knock.
Well, well, well, what's all this?
What do you want, hey?
If you please, Herr Baron, we thought that Mr Henry could do with a glass of his great-grandmother's wine.
Fine old lady, my grandmother.
Very foreseeing of her to prevent my grandfather drinking this.
Mr Henry doesn't need this.
As I said before, I say again, here's to a son to the House of Frankenstein.
Yes, indeed, sir. We hope so, sir.
Come on, give me something to put on.
Undies, in the bag.
Bag? Bag.
Foot of bed.
Complete outfit.
Complete outfit.
Stockings?
Yes, my love, and other confections.
Well, see what you can make out of this.
Why, that's three complete outfits, you goof.
For what, a sparrow?
Do you really wear all that harness?
Poor busy man, doesn't know what the modern girl should wear.
- Be with you in a minute, darling.
- I can hardly wait, my angel.
Well, there's enough left over to dress a finishing school.
Now, don't interrupt me again.
Why not, tired of me after one night?
No, but my name's in the paper, I want to read about it.
Good morning, dear. Good morning, good morning.
Well, did you miss me?
- You bet I did. - I'll bet you didn't.
I did too, now.
Well, I missed you, old darling.
Oh, but I shouldn't say such nice things to you, I'm always spoiling you.
Pardon me.
Say, kid, you know, you're certainly easy to look at. - Sir?
- Mm-hm.
Darn sight nicer than your mother was.
Here, give me that.
More brains too.
Ah, but she was respectable, we're not.
No, we do as we like.
I've just had four weeks with Grandma Ashe and the rest of them.
They think you're the worst father to the most distressful daughter.
How'd you like to be like them?
Wouldn't give your little finger for all the Ashes that ever lived.
Attagirl.
That's the way to talk.
Now, just think, you might have been a slave to the Ashe tradition.
Darling, I'm a slave to nothing but you.
- That's the way.
- Hello, Eddie. - Excuse me.
I thought you were still at your grandma's.
- Have some coffee.
- No, I had a big breakfast.
- Morning, boss. - Hello, Eddie.
- Glad you're back with us. - Thanks, Eddie.
How about getting to the fight a little early boss, huh?
He's been handing out left hooks and right crosses till the state's groggy.
But they got a wallop left. It ain't in the bag, it's still a fight.
We'll have to hit him with everything but the water bucket.
I'll go and get my coat on.
Why so early, Eddie?
It's an hour before court.
I been taking him out for an hour's walk in the morning.
I didn't know you was back.
Tell me, Eddie, has he been drinking?
Well, it wouldn't be a lot for a camel or one of them things.
But these big fights has got him all strung up. Can't sleep.
Gotta do something to forget, you know. He's got a job on his hands.
This case he's on, you mean?
Yeah, but he's in a spot right now.
Oh, he'll come out all right.
Sure, he will.
With just a little help from Eddie, hm?
- We couldn't get along without each other.
- And where do I come in?
We'd both be losers without you, Jan.
- I wouldn't ever kid you.
Hello, you coming along with me?
Try and keep me away.
Don't pretend I'm not the secret of your success.
Say, I'm defending a gambler and a murderer a little home feeling mightn't be out of the way at all.
Oh. I'm just a prop, exhibit X.
Stephen Ashe and daughter, domestic little picture.
Just the effect.
Say, you know, Eddie, this jury system's a grand idea.
She won't do a bit of harm.
That jury's so homesick, they'll bust out crying when you walk in.
Sutter 9-7-6-4.
- Did you find out about that?
- I don't know till we get there. - Why not?
- Couple of guys to grease, can't tell you.
What's the tricks? What's the tricks?
We've got to keep working, that's all.
You two.
It's the quickness of the hand that deceives the eye.
Hello, Madam Ashe, please. - Oh, no...
- Talk to your mother, sir.
- I have so little time.
- Come, come, it's your mother's birthday. Oh.
- Stephen, don't forget the dinner tonight.
On your birthday?
I should be delighted.
Hello, Grandma, many happy returns.
Say, what time's dinner?
Okay, he'll be there.
Jan, don't let him drink.
Hello, Jan, I said keep him sober. He worries me.
Oh, yes, darling, yes, it's a lovely day.
Why don't take a nice long ride in the air.
Yes, see you at 7, dear.
Love and kisses.
Confounded family dinner.
I wish my mother belonged to some other family.
I hate the whole tribe of them.
Except you and mother and me.
Well, we're going to win.
This is the last day, Eddie.
I'm not betting on it, boss. Why not?
Confound you.
- That's it, boss, get good and sore.
- Oh, come on, wait here all day.
No, I don't need those things.
All set.
Gangway. Open up, please, open up.
Got anything to say?
No, no news to tell, nothing at all.
Does your daughter think you'll win?
Of course he'll win. Doesn't he always win?
Got a trick up your sleeve, Mr. Ashe?
No tricks, I just present the plain facts, that's all.
Are you engaged to Dwight Winthrop, Miss Ashe? Why?
Thinking of proposing to me yourself?
Free as the air, thank you.
Sure, it's a sight for sore eyes to see you here again, Miss Ashe.
It's grand to be back.
How's the baby?
The new one's a bit constipated, the others are all right.
Outside of the devil that's in them.
- Have you sent for my client? - Clancy's gone for him, sir.
I wish he wouldn't take such a long time combing his hair.
Give me that Skinner affidavit, will you?
- Any news, Sam?
- Nothing, prosecution's very cocky.
Jiminy, Dad, now the crowd will see you pull a rabbit out of a hat.
Don't say "hat".
You can say anything else, rabbit, toad...
- Good morning. Good morning, Ace, good morning.
Have you studied that cross-examination of Hardy?
Yes, sir, no perjury. Why, um...
Dad, I'm not in the way, am I?
No, no, darling, no.
Mr. Wilfong.
You know, you should get some new pictures for the press.
- Now, should I?
- They sure don't flatter you any.
You're on trial for your life, aren't you? - Sam.
- Yes, sir?
Ask Judge Hannan if he can delay about five minutes, will you, please? - I'll appreciate it.
I'm not allowed to say "hat".
Absolutely nothing that stands up except the fact that three people saw him leave the building without his hat.
But how that stands up.
Is blue your favorite color?
- I was just thinking it ought to be.
- I admit it, it is.
Ace, do you remember exactly what you answered when you were questioned about that hat being found by the body of the murdered man?
And hurry up, will you? Huh?
- Excuse me, Mr. Ashe. Do you remember exactly what you...?
- Yes, I heard him.
I said I had nothing to say, didn't know.
Look here, there's something you haven't told me that would help me out a lot.
I wish I could, sir.
You're holding out on me, aren't you?
Mr. Ashe, a guy like me has to ride with lady luck.
A squealer leaves his pals in plenty of trouble.
I see, you want to go to the gallows with your mouth shut.
Well, you're defending an innocent man. Now, that's all I can say.
That's wonderful, but darned silly.
I had a hunch I'd like to wear your color today.
I'm thrilled to death.
Standing room only, boss. Okay, boss.
- You sure about it?
- You can go to sleep on it.
The judge says all right, Mr. Ashe.
All right, present my thanks and compliments and tell him to fire when ready. Yes, sir.
Ace, I suppose you know your case is in your hat.
- Not quite straight.
- I guess I'll need it.
Ace, I may decide to pull a rabbit out of that hat, so don't look surprised.
I seldom do, sir.
Boys, turn your backs, will you, please?
Department Number 6 of the Superior Court in the city of San Francisco, the state of California is now in session.
If my client is guilty of murder, I want him punished.
But if he's not I want to keep from your kind hearts the awful responsibility of not doing the right and just thing about it.
Now, this, my friends, Your Honor was found by the side of the murdered man.
My client was seen leaving the building bareheaded.
That's been proven, I admit it.
Here are the initials: A.W.
That might be Adam Wright or Allan Warren or Adolph Weems or it might be Ace Wilfong.
But that is the case for the prosecution, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, will you come here, please?
If anybody was planning a speech about my 16th birthday... Eighty of them.
Count them if you don't believe me. All right.
Someone phoned to say that Mr. Ashe is on his way.
Who phoned, Mr. Sampson?
- It was Mr. Eddie, miss.
If this should be my last birthday cake, he'd be sorry he was late, wouldn't he?
What do you mean?
- Now, sit down, sit down.
You know I wasn't in earnest. Don't you know me better than that?
I just wanted to find out how I stood with this family.
Jan, darling, I'll confess there was such a look of impatience on everybody's face at the mention of Stephen's name, I just had to make a fuss.
- You know he loves you, don't you?
Although two in one lifetime...
His father was just the same.
Brilliant, stormy and always late for dinner.
Granny, when you're 101, dear we're gonna put one candle on this cake and start all over again.
- We have a distinguished man here so let's be grateful.
Dwight Winthrop stand up and be embarrassed. - That means you.
One of the world's first dozen polo men.
Here, here.
Ladies and gentlemen the secret of my success is never say die.
Believe it or not.
Seventy-three times the girl said no.
Yes, she said no.
But the 74th time...
Here, here, here, this is my proud day.
Let's go in the next room and have coffee, dear.
- That'll be nice, dear.
- Let's blow out the candles first.
Come on, let's all together.
Our engagement should never be announced to anybody today.
Let's sneak out of the back door.
The things I have to say to you...
You know, this is the oldest game in the world?
I promise you I'll make it new, fresh and colorful every day of your life.
What, backgammon? Oh, heavens.
Is that what we're playing?
And you're blotto.
I am nothing of the kind.
Not a sign, is there?
- Sorry, Sampson.
- Quite all right, Miss Jan.
May I add my felicitations?
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, miss.
Hello, what's that?
I bet that's Dad.
You better go and meet him.
He doesn't care much for this crowd. He may say anything.
Jan, I'm practically one of the family now.
Dinner over? Yes, sir.
- Dad, where have you been?
Bad thing.
He's disgraced this family for 20 years.
Now, now, now. There's nothing you can do.
Hello, everybody.
Well, you'd think the Ashes had all blown away.
I want to introduce my distinguished young friend Mr. Ace Wilfong.
We wanted to congratulate you, Stephen.
- Well, congratulate him. He's alive.
Now I'm sorry.
Don't you be cross, now.
I know I'm late, but I'm sorry.
Time got whizzing by, and well, now...
Happy birthday.
It's good to see you again.
I didn't got much of a chance after court.
Won't you come and meet some of these people?
This is my grandmother. Mrs. Ashe, Mr. Ace Wilfong.
- My Aunt Helen. - How do you do?
Mr. Roland.
Oh, yes. We've met before. Howdy.
Oh, yes. So we have, haven't we?
And this is Mr. Winthrop. Mr. Dwight Winthrop.
Glad everything turned out so well.
Well, can I drop you somewhere?
- Miss Ashe, I'll run along.
- No, you won't do anything of the kind.
Why, this is absurd.
What's the matter with all you snobs anyway?
Why, here's a man who'd be on his way to death if it wasn't for my father.
I think that's a pretty big thing.
We should be grateful that somebody can do it instead of insulting both of them.
After all, Mr. Wilfong didn't drop in. Father brought him.
Jan, I don't think Mr. Wilfong finds this very amusing.
Why not let him float along if he wants to?
You've had no dinner, have you? - Not a bite.
- Should we find someplace?
Jan. Oh, that'll be fine.
Mother, I've met plenty of people in this room who couldn't even get into my place.
Plenty.
Stephen, don't let your daughter leave here with this gambler person.
My daughter does as she pleases.
She's free of your picayune blindfold.
Young man, I'm sorry. It's not your fault.
Yours neither, ma'am.
A lot of people don't believe that gag about being born equal.
- Jan, you're not really going.
Jan, I'll tell you why not.
Sorry, my sweet, but you won't.
I couldn't think of standing for anything like this.
When your father's himself, he realizes notoriety doesn't open my doors.
You're here quite by accident.
Why don't you go?
I've never found out, ma'am, how to take it on the run.
That makes two of us.
- Good night, Sampson. Good night, miss.
Well, you look like a comic strip.
What's the matter with you?
The man was presented at court, wasn't he? Huh?
You know, I just happened to remember I've had no dinner. - Darned thoughtless.
I forgot all about it.
- How about you? That's right.
The air was so thick at the family table I ate almost nothing.
They have great hamburger with onions. Mmm.
Make it two.
Two with onions.
- Why did you cry for speed like that? - Oh, I haven't the least idea.
Yeah, I guess you figured I couldn't talk much at a hundred miles an hour, eh?
Why, if I told you how often I wished I had you like this, you wouldn't believe it. Why me?
The world's full of girls.
Well, why'd Romeo take on so much grief?
- You're amazing. - Oh, yeah?
A lot of nerve? Mm-hm.
Life or death, insults or boasts. You're all the same, aren't you?
No, poker face.
You have to learn it.
Didn't you want to demolish my family tonight?
Yes, it was a little below the belt.
Weren't you scared to death in court this morning? No.
When I met you, I knew my luck was in.
You know, you're the first really exciting man I ever met.
Just what do you mean by that, Jan Ashe?
Down.
Say, what's the ide...?
Talk about life and death. Hi, boys.
Hello, Ace. Hi, boss.
Been waiting around for you, boss.
- Gee, things looked bad this morning.
- Say, what happened just now?
- Oh, Hardy crowd. Close call.
- I'll see you upstairs, boys.
Sure. - Go up the other way.
Glad you're okay, boss.
Where are we going now?
Show you a secret.
My private getaway. Take a chance?
Come on upstairs a minute and get your breath.
They shot the food right from under our noses. Yeah.
Now we're safe.
Just like Monte Carlo. - Oh, yeah.
Be wide open in two weeks. - Hi, boys.
Ace, how are you?
Bottomley. Miss Ashe, this is Bottomley, my butler, my cook, my chambermaid.
- Why did they want to kill you just now?
- Oh, that's nothing to worry about.
- Glad to see you back, chief. - Thank you, Slouch.
Glad to be back.
You saw Miss Ashe in court, boys. Sure.
Howdy, miss.
Slouch, tell her why the Hardy mob tried to fix me up.
Tell her the facts, Slouch.
The mug that was rubbed out, miss, was a snooper running with the Hardy mob.
Hardy gets hip and puts the rat on the spot. They nab the boss's Kelly and plants it.
Your old man jaws them out, and the Hardy mob grabs the typewriters and the ukuleles.
- Thanks, Slouch.
- Okay, baby.
Tank working, Harrington? Sure. - Tank?
What's that?
I'm taking you home in a bulletproof limousine.
Very nice.
Very nice indeed.
Didn't look as though I was going to see it again.
Tell me, just where are we?
On top of the world.
On top of the world.
And nobody comes or goes unless I say so.
Including me?
You love what?
You're just a new kind of man in a new kind of world.
Yesterday you were farther away than the stars and tonight, here you are.
With a very unusual man.
You know I wouldn't offend you for the world.
You haven't offended me.
I just want to do a little thinking.
Do you think you could like me?
I don't quite know what's happened.
Whether it's just the end of a perfect day, or... Or that I'm just a little mad.
Very much apologize, very much.
For I coming in, you no can see.
Champagne, I make him cold.
Fire, make him hot.
I'll be listening to the birdies sing if you do any more of that back-seat driving.
Are you trying to run away from me?
It did look like it, didn't it?
You're a grand girl, Jan. I'm crazy about you.
But you've made a jumping jack out of me the last two or three months.
What's it all mean?
I just don't want to get married, Dwight.
I don't want life to settle down around me like a pan of sour dough.
I don't want it one little bit.
Tell me, Jan is there somebody else? Kind of.
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
Somebody your father approves of?
I can get fighting mad mighty quick for my dad.
I think more of him than anything else in the world.
That's why I can't stand the Ashes.
They think he's weak. Why, he isn't.
Drinking is just a disease with him.
I never said a word about that.
It's what he makes you think.
There you're wrong again.
He says, "Think for yourself".
You know, I think he'd rather like me to marry you, but he'd never say so.
Dwight, all he says is, "Don't run away from things. Don't hide. Get out in the middle of life and if the wind blows you over, pick yourself up again.
Make your own mistakes and learn by them".
- And you know, I think he's right.
Well now I've found out, haven't I?
Oh, dear, please.
But I've got to do something about it.
Looking ahead without you isn't much fun, is it?
Well, what can I do?
I'm going to do something.
You've shot it straight, Jan, like you always do.
Dwight, you're a thoroughbred.
Come on, I'm going to put you back with the Ashes.
Don't you want to dance again?
Darling, you already owe me a new pair of shoes.
Are you suggesting that I am not a good dancer?
No, but we can't both dance on my feet, you know. Mm.
Dwight's a good dancer, though, isn't he?
Yes, but he's not as fascinating as you are.
Don't tell me you're one of the matchmaking Ashes now.
I don't know. Come to think of it, I... In my subtle way I guess I am a matchmaking Ashes.
I must be getting old. I'm sorry.
You know, you never cluck-cluck and spread your wings and say, "Come under, little girl," when it rains.
I ain't got no wings.
Want me, boss? - Yes.
You can shoot from the hip, Eddie. I'm thirsty.
Gun ain't loaded, boss. I'm sorry.
Baby been cluck-clucking just a little?
Oh, no, boss, it's my fault.
I never laid in no eggs.
See, it is hard to mind your own business, isn't it?
Here, give this problem a little thought, Mr. Einstein.
Sure, boss. Okay.
Come on, dear. Here's a little nightcap.
- All that for me? - Mm-hm.
Why, Miss Ashe. - This is too much.
- Here's down the old Golden Gate.
- Good night, Miss Ashe.
- Good night, Mr. Ashe.
Thank you very much for a very charming evening.
Thank you, Mr. Ashe.
Good night, Miss Jan. - Good night, Mr. Ashe.
And don't forget to open a new case tomorrow.
You suggest that I don't open one before tomorrow?
Here, Dad, will you take this upstairs for me?
- Don't you ever go to bed?
- No. I'm gonna turn you over to Eddie.
Say, where are you going after midnight?
- Cluck, cluck...
It's hard to mind your own business, isn't it?
- Good night, sweet. Good night, Eddie.
- Did you take that matter up with yourself?
- Oh, nothing doing, boss.
- Oh, go on, now.
- Oh, I know there's places. But it's... It's leopard's sweat.
Oh, here's some phone calls for you.
These are all...
All of them Wilfong? - Yeah.
- What's he want?
He wants to come over and see you.
- Is he in trouble again? - No, no, no.
Wide open.
Say, I think I'll go and get a little fresh air.
Fresh air?
Yeah, very fresh.
- I'm sorry, boss. - All right.
All right, Eddie, all right, now.
- Hello, Mr. Ashe. - Hello.
How long has this been going on? Take your...
- Here's Mr. Harrington.
How are you? Glad to see you.
Take your wrap? - Yes, yes, yes.
Well, well, Mr. Ashe. We've been waiting for you.
Honor, my hat.
Hey, how long you been like this?
It's nearly five months since you handed him back to us.
- Ace will be right down. - Oh, don't bother him.
I've got nothing but time.
You got any, uh?
Nothing you can want, we won't do for you, Mr. Ashe. Yeah?
Where is it?
Well, here's to the happiest spot I've seen in a dog day.
Say, this is swell.
- Hi, Mr. Ashe, how they treating you?
Fine, never better.
Say, why didn't you tell me about this place?
All right, I'll see you again, Mr. Ashe.
Plenty proud, sir.
- Who's that, John L. Sullivan?
- No, no.
Biggest thing to happen around here, sir, having you.
Have another with me.
I'll have had one with everyone in the house.
Anything around the place.
Okay, look here. If you've got another case, it's going to cost you another $ 10,000.
- You can't chisel me out of a dime. - No, no.
Nothing of that kind.
What's the matter? Didn't you send for me? What are you telephoning about?
Well, it'll keep.
Look around, enjoy yourself.
I might want to gamble. I don't like to be interrupted.
Go on, tell me. What is it?
- Well, it isn't easy cold like this.
- Oh, come on. Out with it, out with it.
- Well, it's about your daughter.
Well, what about her?
Why I want to marry her.
What's the matter with that?
What's the matter with it?
The only time I hate democracy is when one of you mongrels forget where you belong.
A few illegal dollars and a clean shirt, and you move across the railroad tracks.
Tell your boy to bring me some libations, and don't insult your guests.
Hello, yourself.
Say, it's great to come up and find you here like this.
Is it, now?
I was just wondering what I'd do if you stopped dropping in.
You just talked yourself out of the warmest osculation.
Say, don't women ever want to talk?
Is this physiology or biology?
Men of action are better in action, they don't talk well.
Come on. Now, tell me all about yourself.
- How much do you love me?
Let me see how much.
Well, it's about 10 feet high and about 7 feet wide... No, no.
Never mind that.
Oh, I can't measure it now, it's a storm at sea.
- You do love me, don't you?
- It's madness, nothing else.
- Listen, sweetheart.
- Oh, dear, he wants to talk some more.
What's on your mind, darling?
What do you think why?
I'm off my nut about you, you know I am.
Well, why make so much fuss about it, darling?
Jan, there's something, some part of your nature that's taking it on the run from me.
Oh, don't be silly.
Why, I take it on the run right into your arms, don't I, darling?
Yeah, just the same as your father does for booze.
That's not nice.
You're the one person that shouldn't speak unkindly of my father.
None of your friends know about me.
You don't tell anybody anything, do you?
- Of course not, it's my own business.
- You're not shooting over my head, Jan.
You know I've got us dead to right.
We're never seen together anyplace. You steal up here.
Well, you got to get over this idea you're doing me a big favor. You're crazy about me and you know it.
Ace, darling, I'm head-over-heels mad about you.
But what's in the future, I don't know.
I'm telling you.
Oh, no, you're not.
Nobody is.
Marrying you is serious, darned serious.
It would mean the end of a lot of things for me.
My world would close up on me in a minute.
Ah, why worry about them?
A lot of high-hat chiselers.
Cut that, Jan, get me?
Cut it.
It's cut.
Come on, put them around me.
- Leave it just where I put it. - All right.
I know where I put it.
Police, clean up, boys.
- Come on, hurry up. It's a raid.
I had a stack of $500 worth of chips. - Come, we'll fix that up.
But no... Why did they take them away?
You come up and we'll fix that.
Keep your hands...
You don't have to be... - Come along. It's a raid, Mr. Ashe.
- Who cares?
- Mr. Wilfong wouldn't want you mixed up.
Oh, don't raise your voice at me.
Who cares about a raid?
- Now, listen to me, won't you?
Take him upstairs.
- Hello, boys. - Hello, Harrington.
The chief wanted us to pay you a little visit.
Take your hands of me, you dirty swine!
Come on, now. - I'm Stephen Ashe.
Never mind.
- I'll have you...
Police raid gambling house. No arrests.
I was just thinking of Grandma.
- You're a little late, aren't you?
Oh, don't do that cheap sidestepping with me.
Can't we keep this friendly, Dad? We always have.
We were friendly 24 hours ago.
You were laughing at me. And even then, you were carrying on a miserable, backstairs affair with a rat.
Why, you're nothing but a cheap, common, contemptible...
Oh, Dad, my dear darling, forgive me.
What could I do?
Oh, there's something very wrong when we see things as far apart as that.
Something very wrong.
But I'm not cheap.
Not even you can say I am. I can't let you.
But Ace Wilfong...
My dear child, he isn't good enough for you.
Even if you think you're in love with him.
Dad, I'm sorry I've hurt you, dear.
But you've hurt me too.
Yesterday, you won your first case in five months.
Now, there's only one reason why you've lost all the others.
I haven't criticized or preached, and I wouldn't let anyone else do it either.
Oh, Jan, that isn't fair, and you know it isn't.
I've lived most of my life in great anxiety and terrific strain and excitement.
I've had to drink as I've had to breathe, and you know it.
Dad, I think my reasons are better than yours.
Ace Wilfong is the only man in the world I care anything about.
I'm doing what you taught me to do:
Live my own life.
And if I fall and get hurt, why, I'll pick myself up again.
But, Jan, darling, this isn't love.
Believe me, I've seen a lot.
Well, seeing this man, as you have, well, occasionally and secretly is one thing but what if you were ever to marry him?
- I never thought of marrying him until now.
I'm afraid things have caught up with us.
I've done you great, awful harm but when I think of you with this rat...
- Dad, please. - Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just...
When I think of it, it's a complete eclipse.
I can't think of anything. It's just nothing.
That's how much I love you and that's what I've done to you.
God help me.
Look at me, dear.
You know I love you better than anything in the world, don't you?
But another year like this last for you, why, it'd be the end of everything.
I didn't realize it till this minute.
I love you too much to stand by and see you make a wreck of yourself like this.
I love Ace, too, but I'll make a bargain with you.
A bargain?
If you'll quit drinking, I won't see him anymore.
Oh, Jan, I couldn't do it.
I couldn't...
I'm giving up what's in my blood, just as much, every bit.
Dad, you're right. Things have caught up to us.
You're headed for the same dreadful ruin that your father was.
- Jan, how dare you?
- He died in an insane asylum from nothing but drink.
I'm never gonna hurt you like this ever again, dear, I promise.
We've just got the two of us, dear and we've gotta take care of each other, haven't we?
Come on, we'll go away and rough it for six months forget all about this.
- Well, I... Well, I...
- But it's gotta begin right now.
If you never take another drink why, I'll never see Ace again.
All right, my baby.
Hi there, Eddie.
You certainly picked a grand spot.
Did you have any trouble?
Oh, how I hate a smart mule.
Oh, Dad, isn't this glorious? Mm-hm.
Sure is.
Ain't nature grand, Eddie?
Yeah, if we could only take a taxi.
- Tell me, is there a brook around?
- Yeah, right down there.
All right, fine.
And you're sure there's plenty of water to drink?
And not a headache in a tankful.
Hey, look out for that guy. He's got a lot of ideas and they're all bad.
Why, he's sweet.
It's only me he hates.
Oh, all right, all right. Have it your own way.
Are you hurt, Eddie? No.
Oh, Jan, by the way, I... This was handed to me, and I forgot it.
Are you sure you forgot it?
Well, I was getting on the train, and...
Well, there it is anyway.
Don't you wanna open it?
Just as much as you want what you want, dear.
- Do you think so? - Mm-hm.
- No sleep, darling?
You hear those bullfrogs?
You hear what they're saying?
No speak bullfrog.
Well, they're saying, "No rum".
"No rum".
I call that "rubbing it in".
Do you remember the first time you and I went away together?
- I was 5 years old.
- Oh, yeah, where was it?
I don't know, somewhere along the coast.
Don't you remember?
Oh, yeah. I do.
- There was a merry-go-round. - Yeah.
And you stood around all evening and let me ride.
Sweet baby.
We stayed away five days.
- Did we? - Mm-hm.
And the way you combed my hair...
Gosh, it took the nurse three days to get the tangles out when we got back.
- Yeah, we had great times, though.
- Lovely times.
We've had lots of lovely times, you and me.
Such lovely times.
Remember those summers at Catalina?
Hey, I wonder if it wouldn't have been better if I'd sent you to some summer camp and let somebody else take care of you.
Don't you think it might have been better? Huh?
You think so?
Morning, darling.
- What, no sleep, dear?
- Terrible, I know, dear.
- That's it. That's the word. "Terrible".
But listen, dear, we've only been a week.
I know how you're suffering, dear. - But just a little time, and then...
- Suffering. It isn't suffering. It's madness.
All this is really driving me to stark insanity. Dad.
If you don't stand now, dear, you never will.
You're assuming a lot, Jan.
I don't wanna drink.
It's this bargain I resent, that cuts me off from all normal living.
The bargain I had to make to keep you from playing with rattlesnakes.
- Not very fair, darling.
- A crook. With the mob.
Mixed into everything from opium to white slavery.
What kind of a bargain do you call that?
I know it isn't much of a bargain, dear but we thought we ought to try, didn't we?
Oh, I can't stand it.
If I could only get a little sleep.
I'm going mad for sleep.
I can't get a...
Just a few minutes and I'm wide awake again.
It's frightful.
Must we go back?
Goodness knows, I want it just as much as you do.
The reason we're here, I love you better than anything in the world.
Now, must we go back?
No, we'll go on. But let's keep on the move. Okay, darling.
Come on, let's try again.
Just a little sleep and we'll move on.
There, darling.
Daylight's coming.
Just don't think of anything.
Just think how much I love you.
Gee, we missed it.
We've been lost up here for three months and I don't know north, south, east or west.
Well, you've made a man of the old man, all right.
I feel great.
Listen, a bird in a cage twitters good enough for me.
Oh, come on, I'm all excited to get back. - Come on, let's get at it.
- And I'm happy.
I'm going over to see what time the next train leaves.
- I'll see about the tickets too. - All right, dear.
Say, I've got cramps.
- You got any Jamaica ginger?
That'll cost you 10 bucks.
Have you got a little water, please?
A glass?
- What luck, Eddie?
- Jan, I can't find him anyplace.
- You can't?
- I've searched the whole town for him.
Please take care of him.
Oh, hello, Aunt Helen.
Never mind, Sampson.
Well, Jan?
- I'll ring if I want you, Sampson.
- That's all right, Sampson.
- By the way, how have you been?
- Well. I thank you, miss.
Do I take it this means "not welcome"?
- Hold everything, Eddie.
"Not welcome" is putting it mildly.
Would you mind putting those back, Eddie? - Sure.
- You'll wait for me, will you?
- Where's Grandma?
She's not well. I'll talk to you.
- Well, doesn't she want to see me?
- Emphatically not.
- Why, this is absurd. I don't believe it.
- Where have you been these three months?
Now, like any other time, it's none of your business.
That's the conclusion the family has come to, Jan.
None of our business.
We can't control you. - You have no loyalty to what we stand for.
- Why, what do you mean?
Your father endorses these things, so you're better with him.
Oh, shut up, will you?
Tell Grandmother I'm sorry, will you?
Oh, never mind.
Oh, you'll be a lot better off up at the old St. Francis.
- I can't talk. Do you mind, Eddie?
Oh, that's... That's great. That's great.
Right now I have just you.
Nobody else.
Although, I guess I might just as well.
Oh, sure, sure.
Girl here now. Upstairs, your place. Jan, Miss Jan.
Oh, I fix up nice drink, then come along quick.
- Maybe one, three minutes.
Hey, if you're gonna let that dame come and go as she likes you might as well hang up.
- Look out for things. I may not be back.
- Listen.
Cut it.
Sure. I know who's the boss.
Save it for her.
Boss coming right up.
Oh, he all on fire, glad.
He no like them, nobody, like him like you.
- Can I depend on that? - Sure, I watch him.
You know, one time, girl named Nellie say she like strawberry for breakfast.
All right, I catch a strawberry.
Breakfast time come, no Nellie.
Oh, boss, he cross. Very, very cross.
- So he threw Nellie out, hm?
- Sure, sure. Oh, boss.
I run to market, catch some strawberry.
All on fire, glad?
Well, how are you?
I'll go into that in a minute if you'll tell me you're glad to see me.
You are glad, aren't you?
- Think you're quite a gal, don't you?
- It doesn't matter what I think.
Well, you can cut out the kidding, Jan.
You used to get away with that.
I figured it was your language over my head.
Well, we're gonna talk mine now.
All right, Ace.
Sit down. Take your time.
I made a bargain with my father, Ace.
I didn't know how it was going to turn out.
Well, what was the bargain?
That if he'd stop drinking, I'd never see you again.
It wasn't easy, but there wasn't anything else to do.
You thought you'd take three months in the woods. - Try to forget about me.
I figured that.
- Figured what?
- I told him I wanted to marry you.
- Cut that. Cut it now and leave it lay.
- Cut what?
I suppose he asked you to take it on the run and get me out of your system.
- Please, don't do that, I don't like it.
- Got me confused with Nellie, haven't you?
- I haven't got you confused with anybody.
You came here because you wanted to. You were as crazy about me as I am about you.
- That's right, but why so ugly about it?
- You left me flat, explained nothing.
Because a drunken tramp said I wasn't good enough.
- Ace, how dare you.
- Sit down and take it and like it. Listen.
There ain't anyone in your tribe good enough to call me a mongrel.
You must have listened to him or you wouldn't have left me that way. Flat.
Explain to you why I left you?
But I am beginning to wonder why I took the trouble.
Oh, yeah? I'll settle all this.
Hello, Bill speaking.
- Get Harrington.
- Should have come straight to me. Hello?
Get Tom Wills on the phone. - Give him my number.
Tell him to call me. - Okay.
- Right away.
You make no more bargains, sweetheart, with anybody but me.
We get married in the morning.
Wills is a justice of the peace.
- So we're going to get married, eh? - Yup.
And it'll be just too bad for anybody that tries to stop this. Just too bad.
Why, the way I love you, there's nothing left to think about.
It ain't polite, but it's what you want.
Maybe not everything, but you could live without the rest. You can't live without me. That's why you came back here.
You had to.
That's all marriage is.
Just two people that wanna live together.
You can call the rest just nothing.
You're through. You're mine and I want you.
That's the kind of a marriage that I've always dreamed about.
And don't worry about your old man either.
Drunks like that never come back.
- That's consoling.
- That's a break.
He'll stop chasing around in circles.
No man's thinking straight when his liver's shot.
From now on, you listen to me. We get married in the morning.
Said he:
"And suddenly the moonbeams turned to worms and crawled away".
Yeah, in an hour from now, you'll change your silly mind about that.
Who was it called you "mongrel"?
The great Stephen Ashe, darling. The great Stephen Ashe.
Messed his own life. He'll do the same with yours.
Nice, good boss. She come back again, huh? Yup.
We're going to be married in the morning.
Oh, more better.
I exceeding happy. I go get her breakfast.
Strawberry?
Yup, we're going to celebrate.
Come on, let's see what's on ice.
Your stuff's still hanging in the closet, baby.
Make yourself comfortable.
Gee, you look good to me.
How you coming, baby?
Here I come, boss.
Tomorrow, you get all fixed-up nice wife...
Oh, Wills? Ace.
I want you to be ready to marry me at 10 in the morning.
Well, save the kidding till it's over.
Ten o'clock.
Is that you, Dwight?
Yes, I came as fast as I could.
In case I die, I wanted to see you.
Any reason's good.
- You're not quitting, are you?
- You never can tell.
I'm as weary of the world as it is of me.
Jan's back.
- I didn't see her.
Helen met her. Insulted her. She went away.
I can't get her back.
- I don't blame her.
- Want me to try?
Nothing but the truth.
But I do.
She's a poor little devil, Dwight.
The only Ashe worth a nickel, except me.
And my engine's rusty.
She's had no chance, Dwight.
Marry her.
I'd tie her up and do it if I thought it would work.
Don't hold anything against her, Dwight.
I don't know anything against her.
Not a thing in the world.
Stephen was too smart.
Too smart.
- Morning, Jan.
I just seen Ace Wilfong.
Coming here? Can't tell.
Maybe they're gonna try and kidnap somebody, or, you know.
- He's coming up here, Eddie.
I just came up to ask if you'd heard anything about the chief.
You came up here because you thought Ace was coming.
You don't have to see him.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Eddie.
Shouldn't send a boy to do a man's job.
- I'm sorry, Eddie. Are you hurt?
- It's all right.
Just took me by surprise, that's all.
- All right, you big lug.
Go on outside, Eddie. I'll be all right.
I'm staying right here.
No, thanks, Eddie.
Thanks just the same, but I'll be all right.
You go on out.
I'll take a walk with you anytime you want.
And I'll be right outside.
- We're getting married. - Did you forget?
- Take your hands off me.
I was frightened last night.
I was very tired.
I had a bad time.
But you can't really frighten me, Ace.
Getting kind of ritzy this morning, eh?
I'm not lying to myself about you and me.
I thought I had the right to do anything I liked.
I didn't know till last night what I was really doing to myself.
What a beast you were when the surface was scratched.
I found out that only swine should travel with swine.
You're talking to the man you love.
It makes me sick to even hear you say the word.
I've lost the right ever again to think of what love can be or what it means.
For the rest of my life, can't wash the filthy mark of you out of my soul.
That's what I think of you.
And now you can go.
Hey, listen. You haven't a chance. Not a chance.
You've gone too far.
Take your hands off me.
I'm not gonna carry you screaming from the hotel, but you can't get away from me.
I never was as nuts about you as I am right now.
You can be walking along the street or out in your car, but I'll get you.
All I'm gonna do now is kiss you.
Hello, wanderer. Just heard you were back.
Well, we meet again.
Little early for a call, I'm afraid but unusual circumstances.
Mr. Wilfong was just going.
Don't kid yourself for long. I'll be back. - Keep away from me.
- Don't crowd, old man.
Keep your hands off me.
There's a place for those sort of things.
Any idea you're gonna marry him?
- I hope you change your mind about that.
Well, when I get through, he won't have the guts to marry you.
Now, let me lay it on the line for you.
She tossed all the ritz overboard months ago.
She came to my place and she stayed there, you get that?
- She's mine, she belongs to me.
- That's all you're gonna say. Yeah?
I'll spread the news so high, wide and handsome you don't dare marry her.
And you'll come crawling back, like you did last night.
Maybe I'll step out of my class and give you a break.
Listen, buddy.
Take a tip. Back out.
If you don't, you won't live long enough to start the honeymoon.
Sorry, Jan.
I simply couldn't think.
There wasn't anything to say or anything to do.
What he said was true.
I've come to take you to your grandmother.
I'm afraid you must.
Take your hat and coat, sir?
Mr. Wilfong here?
- Who shall I say?
- Dwight Winthrop.
The great polo player?
Yes, the great polo player.
I'm sure he'll be glad to see you.
- Dwight Winthrop wants to talk to you.
- All right, send him in.
This is a good place to talk.
You're not going to talk anymore.
Davenport 2-0-2-0.
Police department.
This is Dwight Winthrop speaking.
I've just killed Ace Wilfong over a gambling debt.
I'll wait for you here at his place.
Take this chair right here, Miss Jan.
Bring out Winthrop, Mac.
Jan, darling, don't cry.
There's so little to say, isn't there?
Except I love you.
You ought to hate me.
I wish you did.
I'm not worth what you've done.
I wish I'd killed him.
Then I'd be here and not you.
Oh, I love you.
I love you as much as I despise myself.
And that's an awful lot.
Oh, Jan, you have nothing to feel badly about.
The world's better with that fellow out of it.
I can't let things drift and go on.
Why, this may be the end of everything for you.
- I can't stand it, I can't.
- Here, darling. Please, please, darling.
You've gotta live, clean and fine as you always have.
- Lf only my father...
- He couldn't do anything.
I killed him deliberately for a gambling debt. - Oh, no, no.
There'll be nothing else in court but that.
But, you know he could always do something.
All right. Time's up.
Time for little boys to go to bed.
Tomorrow, sweetheart.
All my heart, please believe me.
Everything.
All right, you tyrant.
Say, what...? Well, what's the idea, you following me?
Beat it.
Ladies and gentlemen, there's very little for you to deliberate.
All the evidence before you points to deliberate murder.
There are no other circumstances.
You have no alternative except to bring in a verdict on the facts.
And the most important fact is that the defendant confessed he killed Ace Wilfong for a gambling debt.
There never was a more cold-blooded, deliberate crime than this.
The penalty does not enter into the question at all.
And I ask you to return a verdict for murder in the first degree.
If Your Honor please...
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury as attorney for the defense I have not been able to do anything.
My client has confessed.
- The facts speak for themselves. Quiet.
- Will Your Honor pardon me? Surely.
What is it, Stephen?
If Your Honor please I have been informed that there is more to this case than has been revealed.
There is additional testimony.
I now ask permission to reopen the case for the defense and to associate Stephen Ashe as counsel for my client.
I object, Your Honor. The case is closed.
It has been properly tried.
They want to wreck the dignity of procedure and turn this courtroom into a playground for mountebanks.
If Your Honor please, my worthy opponent has lost his temper.
His record of convictions has been greater during the absence of Ashe.
I object too.
The case has been put before you.
There can be nothing gained by further...
I have been embarrassed enough by this case.
- I repeat my request.
- Very well, proceed.
- I object to this unorthodox procedure.
- Court should neglect no evidence.
Mr. Johnson, do you want time to prepare this new evidence?
- Lf Your Honor please Mr. Ashe is ready to go ahead with the case immediately.
If it please Your Honor the prosecution has called me a mountebank.
That's a matter of opinion.
But this is far from being a playground.
As a matter of fact, I'm so ill that the very effort of talking at all is all that I can endure.
I merely mention this to let you know the importance of the occasion that brings me here.
However, I am very grateful to you for your courtesy.
- Proceed, Mr. Ashe.
- I'm only going to call one witness.
I'm going to prove that this killing was done in a fit of temporary insanity.
- Lf Your Honor please... The decision will rest on facts.
I protest. Nothing can make the slightest difference.
We must allow your attorneys to conduct the case.
No interruptions. Don't you see?
Whatever good I did will be shot to pieces.
You'll just make a lot of talk I've avoided. You can't change anything.
Son, don't you see? My hands are bleeding where the spikes have been driven through.
Will you take the stand, please, Miss Ashe?
Do you swear the evidence you give will be the whole truth, so help you God?
- I do. - State your name.
- Jan Ashe.
- Take the stand, please.
- Where do you live?
- St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco.
On the day of the killing, did you see Ace Wilfong?
- Yes, I did. - Where?
St. Francis Hotel.
He came there.
Tell us exactly what happened, in your own way.
- He'd been very brutal the night before...
- I object, Your Honor.
It's all right, I'm not trying to juggle with this witness, Your Honor.
All right, strike out the answer about Wilfong's brutality.
Can you remember my question, Jan?
He came to the hotel quite drunk.
He said that arrangements had been made to get married.
- You and Wilfong? - Yes.
- And you refused? - Yes.
- How did you refuse?
- I told him what a beast he was.
I object, Your Honor.
Ace Wilfong is not on trial.
Try and remember what was said, Jan. You refused, and he said what?
He threatened me.
This is theatrical, emotional.
- Overruled. Proceed.
- He said what, Jan?
He said, "You haven't got a chance to get away.
You may be in your car, you may be walking on the street, but I'll get you".
- And then what happened?
- Then he tried to kiss me against my will.
It was at this moment that the defendant, Dwight Winthrop, came into the room? - Yes.
- What was your relation to the defendant?
We'd been engaged.
Was it true that he, the defendant, was very deeply in love with you?
Can you recall what Wilfong said to the defendant?
- Your Honor... Quiet.
- There's nothing to be gained by this...
- He told Dwight... - I object.
Quiet.
- Jan, you mustn't. Please, you must...
He told Dwight Winthrop I'd gone to his place and stayed there that I belonged to him.
- He said I'd either marry... - You mustn't...
Wilfong said?
Or he'd see that everybody knew I wasn't fit to marry anyone.
And is that all he said?
He said if Dwight Winthrop ever married me that he wouldn't live long enough to start the honeymoon.
- Then he left.
- What did the defendant say?
Nothing. He was...
He was stunned. He...
He took me to my grandmother's.
He stayed there a while and then he left.
- And he had nothing further to say? - Nothing.
- When did you next see the defendant?
- After the arrest. Ah.
And where was your father during all this?
Was there anyone in all the world during this terrible time that you could turn to, except the defendant, Dwight Winthrop?
This is not evidence.
Your witness.
So the bad man threatened to kidnap you, did he?
Oh, I'm not trying to blame Ace Wilfong.
I have no right to and I don't want to.
I'll thank you, Miss Ashe if you'll answer my questions in a straightforward manner.
- Did he threaten to kidnap you?
- Yes, he did.
Was he truthful when he said you went to his place and stayed there?
Did he kidnap you the first time you went there and stayed?
- You went because you wanted to? Yes.
Over how long a period did you go to his place and stay because you wanted to?
- You've been to school? - Yes.
- Good American schools? - Yes.
And you were over 21 when you went to Wilfong and belonged to him, weren't you? - Yes.
And he became a beast after you were through and he wasn't, isn't that it?
- Your Honor, I object to this bullying.
- I am through.
If it please Your Honor...
Your Honor, I've served here a good many years.
I crave some latitude so the jury may fix the responsibility for this crime where it belongs.
Say it.
Jan, my child you never knew your mother, did you?
No, she died when I was born.
You never had any guidance from anyone but your father, had you?
Was there very great affection between you and your father?
Oh, very great. There still is.
I think he's the most wonderful man in the world.
Had you complete, absolute faith in his teachings and his point of view?
Yes, of course, always.
And did he find you in Ace Wilfong's place?
- What time of day was it?
- Late at night.
Up to this time had he ever criticized your friendship with this man?
No, he had not.
Had he ever given you any advice or warning about it at all?
Why, he didn't think it was necessary.
And this night that he found you there, was he able to protect you? To fight for you? To help you in any way at all?
- Yes or no? - Why, no.
Why not?
Was it because he was so drunk that he couldn't protest or help you in any way?
Oh, please don't. Please stop.
My father taught me to stand on my own feet. That's all, nothing else.
Just not to be a coward.
I ask to define the nature of evidence.
If I got smashed up, it's my fault, nobody else's. I knew what I was doing.
My life was my own affair.
I'm not trying to blame anybody for anything at all.
Jan, dear.
Your Honor ladies and gentlemen.
But, my friends I'm not tearing my very heart out here before you nor the heart of this child that I love above all things in the world.
I'm not doing that without the valid hope that it's going to help you in doing justice.
There's not one atom of the brutal evidence that I brought out that the defendant didn't know.
How much he loves this girl, you know by now.
He was going to the gallows with his lips sealed.
But, my friends, I can't have that.
I'm going to ask you to listen with your hearts.
Dwight Winthrop knew that from the cradle on through all her years Jan Ashe listened to one mentor, only one.
Her father.
Dwight Winthrop knew this too: That she placed no moral value on this ugly thing until the result and the punishment threatened the rest of her life.
You who have sons should pray that they might have the nobility and kindness of this young man.
And you who have daughters must believe with him that she was not to blame.
It was through her father that she met this gambler, this beast.
Her father endorsed this unholy friendship.
And when this man threatened the rest of her life this father wasn't there to protect his daughter.
All this, Dwight Winthrop knew.
All this was caught in the whirlpool of his love.
The poor boy went insane.
And he's not guilty of cold, deliberate murder.
There's only one breast that you can surely pin the responsibility of this crime on. Only one.
Stephen Ashe is guilty, and nobody else.
Your Honor I...
Please change your mind, Jan, don't go.
If I were only sure that it would make you happy always.
I'm sure, Jan.
Wait a little while, darling.
I'll be in New York, working at something.
I'll follow you there.
If you ever do I'll follow you to the ends of the earth.
- That's a date.
- Pardon me, sir.
The secret of my success is never say die.
Level off, Cary!
Level off!
Shep, are you all right?
Can't make it, Cary.
I Can't make it.
Here, give me your arm!
I'll get you out of here!
Hang on there, Shep!
Get a hold. Just hold tight, old fella.
Well, the old guerre is finie.
What are ya gonna do now, Shep?
Get tight.
Stay tight.
Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood.
You two leaving us, eh?
In a way, I'm sorry to release you two. But I have no choice in the matter.
What am I going to do, Major, about my - oh, this rotten business?
Spasmodic twitching of the muscles under the eye, eh, Lieutenant?
What the French call a tic. T
- I - C, tic.
Little bothersome, isn't it?
I'm afraid time'll have to take care of that.
Time and normal living.
You two are returning to the United States, I presume?
We haven't decided.
I'd take the first boat home.
Well, here you go.
Oh, I forgot your burnt hands.
Neither of you is fully hospitalized. I'd undertake a systematic course of finger exercises.
To, uh, stretch them and loosen them up.
In time, you'll regain their full use.
Thank you, sir.
Bye, Lieutenant.
Bye, Lieutenant.
Well, there they go. Out to face life.
And their whole training was in preparation for death.
Why can't they go on with flying?
You know, the air mails or something?
I'm afraid they're unfit for further service in that direction.
They fell, you know - six thousand meters.
Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on the pavement.
Shattered both of them.
Their nervous systems are deranged, disorganized, brittle.
Spent bullets.
Spent bullets That's it.
They're like projectiles, shaped for war and hurled at the enemy.
They've described a beautiful, high-arching trajectory.
And now they've fallen back to earth.
Spent.
Cooled off.
Oh, well, if they take care of themselves, they'll pull through all right.
Even if they do take care of themselves, what good are they?
What can you expect of them?
I hate to think what may become of them.
Hello, Cary!
- Hi, Cary!
Hello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!
- Hello, Bill! Francis!
Well, I see you got yours.
Paris!
Paris?
See you in Paris!
How 'bout a cocktail?
- Not a bad idea at that.
But, if I'm not too inquisitive, would you mind telling me what IS that you're drinking?
Teeth.
- Teeth?
Hey, it's teeth!
Teeth!
- That's right.
It's a full set, upper and lower.
It's a nice expression.
Hey, how come you're with those teeth?
I was just standing here. And a nice gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would I mind holding his teeth for a minute.
Well, what did he want you to hold his teeth for?
Said he wanted to biff somebody.
- Biff somebody?
! Which way did he go?
! Just around to the right.
- Come on, men!
Would you like to come along?
I have to stay here and mind the man's teeth.
Oh, of course.
Well.
THAT'S all fixed.
Well, we missed it.
Well, they carried a guy out.
Say! What's become of the teeth?
Oh, the man came and got his teeth.
Well, what did he say?
- He said thank you for holding his teeth.
I think he fell in an airplane in the war and got his teeth knocked out.
Why do you think he was in the war?
Oh, he had a kind of little striped ribbon in his buttonhole.
What makes you think he was a flyer?
His eyes.
- His eyes?
You can tell a flyer better by his ears.
Well, what do you say we have a drink?
Could I have a champagne cocktail?
! Can you imagine that, fellas?
Her name is Nikki!
Her name is Nikki.
She holds men's teeth. She sits at the bar and she drinks champagne.
Boys, she's gonna be a lot of trouble.
Oh, my, my!
Poor sweet! She can't even hold her glass!
Oh, well, HE can't either.
Besides, he has to use two hands.
Course he can't hold his glass.
His hands are burned.
You have no right to spill YOUR drinks.
He can't help himself.
How burned?
He brought a plane down on fire.
An airplane? In the war?
He held the stick. But his hands began to slip. Then he held it inside his arms.
He was trying to bring his rear gunner down alive.
Did he bring him down safe?
Brought him down.
Oh, so that's why -
That's why he can't hold a glass.
Oh, I'm so ashamed.
Now, Cary's had a pretty thin time.
His nerves are tricky.
You should never call attention to his hands.
Hi, Cary.
Oh, hello, Frink.
Hello, Francis.
Shep.
Drunk again.
Say, don't you know any OTHER opening remarks?
It's about all we've heard from you for a year.
Say, why don't you fellows go home and go to work?
Oh, anything useful.
What could we do?
Sell washing machines?
Drive a milk wagon?
Mend old furniture or somethin'?
Go back to flying.
Fly the air mails.
Aw, we couldn't fly a kite.
Maybe a small kite.
Well, there must be something you can do.
We've got to tend to our drinking.
We don't get much opportunity.
Lots of things going on outside.
Sun shining, trees growing, people walking around.
Say! Is that STILL going on?
Sounds pretty pre-war to me.
Don't I rate an introduction?
Who's your swell friend?
Oh, her?
Just an old hussy we found scattered around.
Pay no attention.
Sometimes he goes away.
Oh! He didn't go.
Your hands...
Oh, your poor hands!
Your poor, poor hands.
If you aren't the WORST!
First, you insult his hands and make him mad.
Then you cry over them and make him self-conscious.
Come on back here.
Well, that's torn it.
He'll never come back now.
Then we'll have to find him.
To explain how sorry I am.
Well. You don't have to get so emotional about it.
Who's getting emotional?
You're coming all apart.
Take a drink of this.
Make you laugh and play.
Say, what's she crying about?
She's crying on account of they didn't wash her strawberries this morning.
Didn't they wash your strawberries this morning?
There ain't a whole hell of a lot that we can do about that now.
Hey! Where're you goin'? !
Oh, out.
- Out where? !
Out to get a drink.
Don't you suppose you could arrange that here? !
Nope. We gotta go somewheres else.
Come on, Francis.
We got to go somewheres else to get a drink.
Hey! There he is!
Say, what are you tryin' to do, disown us?
Sure we'll sit down. What'd ya think we'd do?
Hello, Cary.
What will you have to drink?
Martini!
Uh, could I have champagne, please?
Boys, she's goin' to be a problem.
That's what I started on.
It upsets me if I change over to anything else.
There's a lot of things wrong with this one.
What were you doing at the bar at Claridge's anyway?
Yes. Don't you know you're not supposed to be there?
There's that sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back.
Can't read signs.
Well, we'll just have to take care of her, that's all.
Do you think she's good-lookin' enough?
Oh, I know I'm not very good-looking but -
But when I was a little girl, my mother always said I had the nicest hair-ribbon.
Then there's her drinking.
What's the matter with my drinking?
- You're a sissy drinker.
Well, maybe I can improve.
Then there's her teeth.
Why, one of 'em is turned sideways.
You mean this one?
Why don't you have it turned around?
I don't have it turned around on account of it's a kind of help.
Well, in what respect does it kind of help?
Well, you see, when anyone kisses me too hard, it splits my lip.
And you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed.
So now I don't let anyone kiss me - hard.
Well, we'll let that pass.
Shep went off to sharpen his skates.
Now, about your nose.
What about my nose?
It isn't straight.
It kind of turns up at the end.
Well, when I was a little girl, I got bumped by a swing.
How'd you happen to get bumped?
I just walked through the gate.
I was only seven.
Oh, poor dear.
Didn't you see it?
I can't see very far.
Did it hurt?
It made me dizzy all day.
Well, I guess we can't hold that against her.
Michelangelo painted Adam with a navel.
All the same, he'd look funny the other way - even in a painting.
He went off to shave a horse.
Have you got a husband or anything?
Mother, yes.
But we haven't met in quite a long time.
Why not in a long time?
Well, on account of my mother's name was Beulah.
Now, you can't have a mother named Beulah.
So I changed it to Jane. And that's how it all began.
He's goin' off to tame an alligator.
Who is he, anyway?
Francis used to fly with us in the 94th.
The best shot in the squadron.
Brought down twelve planes.
Used to call him "Sudden Death".
He lost interest after his teammate got killed.
He's lonesome is all.
He carries a chiming watch on account of he's always falling asleep in the daytime.
What kind of chimes?
Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and Whittington.
I'll take vanilla.
I think he's a washout.
Well, just because you're a big bombardier and an All-American -
All-American what?
Halfback.
Oh, Montana State or somewhere. Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle Indians or something.
never read about Bill?
Bronko Bill - the Alabama Flash?
I think it's a forgery.
Say!
Tackle a horse?
Sure. Go ahead.
Tackle a horse.
All right, all right, I'll tackle a horse.
Here comes one now.
Look out, horse!
Bill! Come back here!
What's the idea running' down my friend like that?
Never mind.
Look where you're going in the future now.
You just watch out where you're going!
Whoa, whoa. Nice horsie.
Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You old fool! You know what you'll do?
You'll kill yourself one of these days.
Now, come on, get out of here.
Now, listen - You all right now, brother?
Now, you just keep your horse, see?
Hey, listen, Bill, you're All-American, see?
You're TWO All-Americans! The lady's convinced you're the whole team.
You don't have to tackle any more horses.
How 'bout that? - Drink your drink.
Ahhh. Wasn't that a great spill?
Would you all excuse me for a moment?
To take a Chinese singing lesson.
What kind of a girl do you think Nikki is?
I think she's the kind that sits down on phonograph records.
Say, Nikki, let's ditch these drunks and go off somewhere by ourselves.
These crazy fools are liable to do anything.
Since the war, they don't care what happens.
And do you?
I'll say so.
I've got more important things to think of.
What more important things?
Well, my work.
I'm the foreign correspondent for a New York newspaper syndicate.
How nice for you!
Nikki?
Are you the kind of girl that sits down on phonograph records?
People shouldn't leave their records lying about.
What did I tell you?
Take me dancing?
What place you wanna go?
- What places you got?
Well, we got Maxim's, only it's too early.
We've got Florida, Perroquet, Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge, Bal Tabarin.
I'll take vanilla.
Somebody pay for the drinks!
We're off in a blizzard of horse-radish!
My, my! Isn't this nice?
Now, listen, men.
I'll tell ya something funny.
I was only four years old once.
Said he was only four years old once.
And my aunt had a very low-neck dress on.
Said his aunt had on a very low-neck dress.
Can't believe it.
And she sat right across the table in front of me.
And I said, "Auntie - I can see your knees!"
I wonder what's doing in Portugal tonight.
Maybe I'd better do my match trick.
If you do match tricks, I'll recite.
Recite what?
Whose poetry?
- My poetry.
You write poetry?
I'll send you a photograph of my poetry.
Say, I wonder if there's anything intoxicating in that.
Just what ARE your plans?
You'll have to watch that lad, Nikki.
He's a member of the Wandering Hands Society and he has a groping good time.
Your behavior, sir, is unseemly, unethical, indelicate and lousy.
Have I made myself clear?
All right. My mistake.
You'll have to watch out for him, Nikki. He's just a licentious old man.
It's getting pretty late, isn't it?
Do you want to go home, Nikki?
Hotel Carlton.
I'll take her home, too.
- So will I!
We'll match to see who takes her home!
Nothin' doing! We'll ALL take her home.
She belongs to us all now!
Let him sleep.
What's your number?
Eighty-eight.
Goin' up!
Who's gonna pilot this craft?
I'll take her off.
Where's the throttle?
Got your safety belts buckled? - Mm hmm.
Here it is.
Contact?
We're off!
Shut her off!
Hold her nose! She's headed for the hangar!
Hey, stop it, will ya?
We've gone an' passed my floor.
Gone an' passed your floor?
I'll fix that.
Put her tail down!
Bail out, boys! She's gonna crash!
Stop it! Stop it!
We've gone an' passed my floor again.
Say! How do you stop this thing?
That's right, laugh.
We should've brought our parachutes!
Get a good hold, Millie.
We're off again.
Nothing doing!
Let Cary take the controls.
You'll run us through the roof.
All right, all right.
- All set?
There we are.
That's a pilot for ya.
You deserve a medal.
All right, come on, men.
Eighty-eight!
Look!
Nikki's got a whole apartment!
And a gramophone! Yeah!
And chairs and tables and floors and ceilings and everything.
So THIS is where Nikki lives!
Yes, this is where Nikki lives.
And she's got a book!
Got all the comforts of home.
Hey! Look at all the bottles!
Come on in and look at Nikki's bottles!
Ylang Ylang!
Hey, don't be handling' her things.
Put 'em down.
Chichi!
- Leave 'em alone.
Salammbo! Chypre! Reve de Vestale!
Jinko!
Hey, you big bombardier -
Say, I never saw so many shoes.
She never winds her clock!
It says eleven and I've never been anywheres at eleven.
What time are you anywhere?
Two o'clock.
It's always two o'clock in my life.
Hey, listen. Besides never having any matches and always spilling her drinks, she never winds her clock!
Think I'll go in the bathroom and see if she leaves the cap off her tooth paste.
Is it all right?
Hello, yourself.
TURTLES!
Turtles?
Turtles!
- Turtles? !
It IS turtles! - Hey!
Look, Cary! It's turtles!
Nice work, boys.
It's turtles.
And now do you suppose you could all excuse me?
On account of I'd like to go to bed.
Sure we'll excuse you.
I'll clear everybody out of here.
Come on, you fellas.
Nikki wants to go to bed.
Yup, all right.
So long, turtles. - Good night, turtles.
- Night, turtles.
Poor Nikki.
Do you wanna go to sleep?
Sleep? You should NEVER go to sleep!
Well, good night.
Nighty-night, Nikki.
Good night, Cary.
Say! I like this place.
Say, I like this place, too.
I think it's swell.
You fellas think you're gonna PARK here?
Will somebody please scrub my back?
Will somebody scrub your back?
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Scrub hard.
Did anyone ever see such a back in their life?
Did anyone ever HEAR of such a thing?
Just look at that back.
Just look at that thing, won't you?
My, my!
I could go on doin' this a long time.
Well, practically.
Beulah is rich.
Well, just how rich IS your mother?
Leave a lady a few secrets, can't you?
That was EVER so cool and nice.
- Good night, Nikki.
You're gonna stay here, huh?
She might need some more help!
Messieurs. - Morning. - Morning.
Um, prairie oyster.
- Prairie oyster.
Prairie oyster.
Say, we'd better get back to our hotel.
There's no Nikki at our hotel.
And the bar doesn't open so early.
Why don't we move in here?
Sure. Let's stay here.
But - what about Cary?
What about Cary?
What ABOUT Cary?
We can move him in, too.
Not a bad idea!
Well, come on, men. Let's go.
Hi, Nik!
Hello, Nikki!
Good morning, Nikki.
Hello, Shep.
Hello, Cary.
Hello, Francis.
Morning, Nikki.
I didn't expect to see you all so early.
We camped on your doorsteps last night.
And this morning we all moved in.
Despite your practically innumerable faults, we adore you.
We've decided to adopt you.
Well, for heaven's sakes! Look at Nikki!
What are you having done to yourself, gal?
Whatcha having your toes painted for, Nikki?
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Why, look at Nikki's legs, would you?
That there is practically the loveliest pair of legs I ever saw in all my born days.
Like my legs?
Look at those legs, Cary.
My, they nearly match.
Did you ever see such a swell set of legs?
Burst into tears?
Would it embarrass you, Nikki, if Cary were to burst into tears?
On account of my legs?
Oh! I think that would be sweet.
Oh, boy! Here come the drinks!
Here, Nikki, drink this.
Make you laugh and play.
That's what I want to do, laugh and play.
Here's to Nikki's dainty legs.
As smooth and hairless as an egg.
Well!
Here comes that licentious old man.
Still drinking?
How can you tell?
Morning, Nikki.
Say, I don't think Nikki likes you.
What do you wanna hang around for?
Well, what do YOU hang around for? Me?
Why, I came to bring Nikki some posies.
I'll bet you didn't bring Nikki any posies.
I
- Well -
Cure the shakes.
I haven't got the shakes.
Let's see.
Hold out your hands.
No, turn them over.
Say, that's pretty good.
Let's see if you can hold this.
Say, that's great.
Steady as a rock!
Well, I guess that'll keep his hands out of mischief for a while.
Take these off.
Now, let's see. Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted?
We were talkin' about Nikki's legs.
And havin' a fine time, too.
Let's inspect the job.
Oh, my poor toes.
Don't look too close.
Well, what's the matter with your toes?
Well, when I was a little girl my mother bought me a new pair of shoes.
And they were WAY too short.
And I had to walk all the way to Sunday school and back
Down the road.
And it was hot and dusty.
Oh, take her away! She's breakin' my heart
And when I got home... my toes were spoiled.
Oh, dear, oh, dear. That's such a sad story.
Let's all have a drink, quick!
And now would you all excuse me?
On account of I'm gonna put on a dress.
What's HE getting so excited about?
You guys think you're so darn smart.
Well, cheerio, fellas. I'm off.
- See ya later.
What are the plans for the day?
Well, on account of it's raining and everything, we thought we'd go over to the Cluny and play billiards and drink beer.
How about Cary?
Went to get his hat and coat. He's going to P?
re Lachaise. P? re Lachaise?
What's P? re Lachaise?
How 'bout you coming with us?
No. I'm going with Cary.
You've been invited?
Do you think Cary might object?
Well, I have an idea he'd like to be alone.
Why alone?
Well, Cary likes to be alone.
He's as brittle as a breadstick.
One silly crack from you and he might break up in sections.
Well, then, I don't think he should be left alone.
Tell me, what's Cary doing in Paris?
What are we all doing in Paris? I know.
But why doesn't he go home?
Well, he's not ready to go home.
What could he do if he went home?
Have people cry over his hands?
Well, it seems - a pity to go on like this.
He's such a sweet soul.
One of the best.
Isn't he just sort of wasting himself?
He's trying awfully hard to get hold of himself.
If you tag along, for heaven's sake, be careful what you say.
Don't start getting sorry for him and don't cry over him.
And, above all, don't make any unfortunate remarks, hear?
Oh, I won't.
Why, who ever heard of such a thing?
Cary? ! Cary?
I'm coming with you.
Oooh! Ooh, wait for Nikki!
Wait for Nikki!
What are you changing your shoes for?
On account of I can walk faster in red shoes.
Perhaps we'd better stay here a while till it clears up.
Could we sit down here, do you suppose?
What should I drink now, do you suppose?
Picon citrons? Very refreshing.
Make you laugh and play.
That's what you always promise.
Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on drinking so desperately?
Don't we all?
- Not like Shep.
Well, Shep has that tic under his eye, you know.
Takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet.
But isn't there some kind of treatment or something?
Shep could never stand a long course of treatment.
Drinking's the only corrective so far as he's concerned.
He's found out the tic doesn't work when he's tight.
So he stays tight.
Seems such a pity.
How did he get the tic?
In the war.
I know. But how?
Well, it's not very romantic.
Well, don't tell me if you don't want to.
You see, a tic is a nervous habit.
Lice under his bandages.
He had the devil of a time.
He nearly lost his mind.
So you'll have to excuse him a little.
I'm so sorry for Shep.
Well, don't let him know it.
Well, isn't he going home? Not ever?
Not ever.
Not in his dark glasses anyway.
Can't something be done for him?
He'll have to be - reborn.
How's he going to end?
Well, how are you going to end?
How am I going to end?
How is ANYONE going to end?
How's your picon citron go?
It goes fine.
But doesn't ANYTHING make any difference to you?
A long time ago, perhaps, when I was a little boy
Tell me, where were you little?
In Minnesota.
Were you happy then, Cary?
Tell me, what WAS there to be happy about on a farm in Minnesota?
Ohhh, thorn-apple trees in blossom.
The smell of burning leaves in the fall.
The sound of horses' hoofs on the road.
Did you ever dig up an Indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field mice?
Or explore old trunks in an attic?
Listen to the moaning of the telephone wires in the winter wind?
See a gypsy caravan?
So THAT'S why you were happy.
On account of apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and old trunks and things?
But aren't you going back?
Would you like another picon citron before you go?
The rain is lifting.
Who all is buried here?
Oh, poets, painters, philosophers,
- Cocoanut?
No cocoanut.
Poets, painters, philosophers, musicians.
There's Chopin.
Oh, I practiced him.
And there's Balzac. And there's Heloise and Abelard.
Oh, tell me about Abelise and Eloard.
No, Nikki. Not Abelise and Eloard. Heloise and Abelard.
I really didn't do it on purpose.
It was on account of the picon citron.
Tell me about Heloise and Abelard.
Well, they're buried here in the same sepulchre side by side.
Why are they buried side by side?
They were the world's most famous lovers.
There's the tomb.
Tell me about the world's most famous lovers.
Well, Abelard was a scholastic philosopher -
Whatever that is.
- Whatever that is.
He gained a footing in a certain household as tutor to a maiden called Heloise.
And employed his unlimited opportunities for the purpose of - Well, betrayal.
Not, however, unmixed with real love.
He carried her off to Brittany.
Well, her uncle was furious. He blamed Abelard for the whole thing.
He conceived a terrible revenge.
I'm afraid for Abelard.
He broke into Abelard's apartment one night and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment.
The lovers were forced to live their lives apart.
But when they died, they were buried here side by side.
There's a story that little heart-shaped stones are supposed to grow around the tomb.
Heart-shaped stones?
And lovers come and find them and exchange them with each other.
And, so long as you keep the stone from the tomb of Heloise and Abelard, no harm can come to your true love.
How perfectly beautiful.
Isn't that a quaint legend?
Do you think I might find a heart-shaped stone?
You help me, Cary.
All right, Nikki. Only we have to leave soon.
They close up the place.
Just as soon as we find our stones.
I found one!
And, now, you take mine. And I'll take yours.
Isn't that the way the story goes?
That's right, Nikki.
And, now, no harm can come to our true love.
And, now, we'll have to go.
You were so nice to let me come with you.
And I spoiled your whole day.
You were going to do something else, weren't you?
Doesn't matter.
Well, what was it, Cary?
Why did you come here today?
To pay my respects to an old comrade.
And you wanted to be alone.
Don't pay any attention to me, Cary.
I can't help it. You MAKE me cry.
Oh, don't look so troubled, Cary.
I just want to cry for a minute.
On account of you're so nice. You're so clean, Cary.
And your teeth are so white.
You're so civilized.
You don't care about anything any more, nor anybody.
Nothing makes any difference to you.
Nothing can touch you.
Why, you're lost.
You're ALL lost.
You and Shep and the rest of you.
Oh, I want to do something for you.
Let me wash your bracelet, Cary.
Why, see?
The silver's all tarnished.
The silver's all tarnished.
I'll take it with me and scrub it when I get home.
I'll polish it with my nail-brush.
Well... Anyway, we found a name for my turtles!
Heloise and Abelard?
A name for your turtles?
So that's what you were looking for.
I might have known how it would end.
Hi, Nik.
Cary's in a state.
Says he's going away.
Can't stand it any longer and all that sort of thing.
What happened between you two, anyway?
Cary seemed so sad and everything - on account of I'd taken up his whole afternoon.
So little Nikki said, all merry and bright, "Well, anyway, we'd found a name for my turtles".
Found a name for the turtles
That's funny!
Name for the turtles!
That's so funny, all right!
Why do you always HAVE to be funny at the wrong time?
Didn't I tell you Cary was brittle?
How did he respond to THAT line?
Pulled down the iron curtain.
Did he say he was going away? Yup.
Gotta get away from it all.
Then, you've got to go to him right now! And explain that I didn't mean it! Tell him how it was and everything!
Listen -
No, go on.
You go right now before it's too late!
But Nikki -!
You go right straight to Cary.
Now, listen, Cary, you don't have to behave like an old Easter egg.
You're breaking Nikki's heart.
She doesn't know any better.
She doesn't know any better?
Well, whether she does or not, I'm going a long ways away from Nikki.
Nikki and her turtles.
You sure are in an uproar.
What YOU need is a drink!
I need more than a drink.
I need a lot of geography between me and that girl.
Where do you want to go?
Anywheres.
So long as it's a long way from Nikki.
You know - that girl does things to me.
I've got to get away.
Well, I wonder what's happening in Portugal tonight.
I wonder what IS happening in Portugal tonight.
If Cary's going to Portugal, why can't we go to Portugal, too?
Ain't we got any rights?
Sure we got rights!
Cary better not think he can screw up in Portugal and leave old Shep behind.
Say, when's he leaving?
Ten-thirty in the morning.
Don't we have to have passports and things?
Sure we gotta have passports!
What kind passports you like?
- What kind passports you got?
We have ebony, cocoanut, thornberry passports.
I'll take vanilla.
I'll see you on the train.
You're goin', too?
I might, uh, pick up a couple of features for my paper - in Portugal.
- Did you put all my shoes in?
You bet.
There they are.
Don't we have to go like anything?
The train leaves in twenty minutes.
Are you SURE you have everything?
Hardly seems enough.
Oh, my turtles!
Here you are, Francis!
You're the custodian of the turtles!
Now don't fall down on the job.
Hey! I never tended turtles before.
Now, all you have to do - is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like this.
Oh, yeah. I see.
Come on, Francis! Take those turtles!
There she is, boys!
The Sud Express!
Can you imagine Cary tryin' to run away and leave us behind?
Do you suppose he's really gonna be here?
Sure he'll be here. He's never missed a train in his life.
Say, do you suppose the turtles'll be all right with that porter?
Aw, sure they'll be all right.
All you got to do is - sprinkle 'em!
Say, Cary!
Hello, Cary.
Well, hello.
What are you all doing down here?
We just came down to see you off is all.
Well, that's darn decent of you.
Ya got a nice seat?
Yeah, right by a window.
Oh, how nice for you!
Come on! Show us your seat by the window!
Yeah, come on, Cary! We wanna SEE that seat by the window.
My, my, what a swell train.
Sud Express, Train de Luxe.
Say, I wonder if a chap can get a drink on this train. Sure!
I don't see why not.
Push the button.
Well, I'm afraid you won't have time for a drink.
We're gonna start in a minute.
You'll have to get off.
Get off? !
Gosh, no. We LIKE this train!
This is a Train de Luxe.
Yes, we like trains de luxe, don't we, Nikki?
Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like.
He's blowing the whistle.
Hey, we're gonna start.
Well, let her start.
Let 'er go Gallagher.
Who cares? ! Who cares?
! - Who cares?
! Hello, everybody.
And you, too?
That's right.
Who cares?
Goodbye!
Hi, men! Look what I found.
Hooray! Come in.
- Ah, thank you, no, not I.
- I say, are you all going to Portugal? Yup.
We're going down there to investigate conditions.
Investigate conditions?
Drinking conditions, mostly.
By the way, what ARE conditions?
Don't you know what conditions are?
No. Never saw one in my life.
The drinking conditions are pretty bad right here.
Ahh, indeed.
My beer's full of cinders.
Good for ya.
Make ya lay hard-shelled eggs.
The man says your compartment's ready.
I'm glad - on account of it's been so hot and I'm so tired and I want to go to bed.
Going to bed?
Who ever heard of such a thing?
Can we help you undress?
No, thank you, William.
Take off your shoes?
- Undo your hair?
Scrub your back or something?
No, I can manage quite well by myself.
Good night, Nikki.
Can you imagine that ungrateful old trollop?
She wouldn't let them help her undress.
Can't understand it at all.
You know, she's not very pretty.
But when she was a little girl, her mother always said she had the nicest hair-ribbons.
Indeed?
She got one tooth turned around, she can't see very far, and she's ALWAYS speaking out of turn.
Otherwise, she's a mighty fine piece of architecture.
Seems to need a few repairs.
She's got eyes like an Assyrian Queen's got eyes.
You ain't never seen no Assyrian Queen!
You're just a-makin' that up outta yore own head!
I did SO see an Assyrian Queen.
In whose green hat?
In the Metropolitan Museum's green hat, that's whose green hat.
Hold on there! Where you goin'?
You're not going anywhere.
You go back to your turtles, hear?
You've been neglecting your assignment.
I have to sprinkle the turtles, see?
Sprinkle the turtles?
Cool 'em off.
Turtles get feverish on trains.
Cary!
Cary! Bill! Shep!
Say! Get out of here!
Say, what's the idea?
What's the idea?
Well, what business is that of yours?
Nikki, you all right?
What is this tough trying to do to you anyway?
Well, I was just going to bed and he came in and flang himself all over me.
Frink, you'd better get out of here right away before something happens to you.
What right have you to tell me to get out of here?
This isn't your compartment, is it?
Oh, I see. You wanna argue about it.
If you don't clear out of here right now, you're liable to get hurt.
All right. Suppose you put me out.
Put him out? I'll snap his spine and throw him off the train!
Hold everything, Bill!
Oh, dear, does everybody have to act like this?
I'm not gonna let these silly drunks tell ME where to get off.
Silly drunks?
- Silly drunks, did you say?
Yes. And that goes for the whole bunch of you.
Let me have him.
You will, eh?
Socko!
Now, ain't that nice?
Have you ever seen anything so cute?
Will you be all right now, Nikki?
- Uh huh. Grab hold of that fella and drag him out of here.
Here, Francis. Do your stuff.
Frink, don't you know better than to try a stunt like that?
- I lost my head over the girl is all.
Well, you apologize to Nikki in the morning.
And don't you ever get out of line again.
The next time, it might be different.
Wake up, ya big sissy.
It'll make you laugh and play like any old thing.
Say, Cary, what day is this?
Wednesday what?
The twentieth.
What month, I mean?
You mean to say you don't know what month this is?
I knew once but I forgot.
Well, it's June. The merry month of June.
Say, maybe I better get up.
What town are we in?
You're in Lisbon, Portugal.
Lisbon.
That's where I thought it was.
I just wanted to check up is all.
Say, what's the matter with you, Shep?
Don't you really know where you are or what day it is?
I kind of lose track of things.
Say, this is getting serious.
Serious? Is anything serious any more?
Well, it's serious when you don't know where you're at.
What's gonna become of you?
Oh, I'll be all right when I've had a couple of drinks.
Say, what town did you say this was?
I just told you, Lisbon.
Come on, now, pull yourself together, Shep.
We gotta get organized for the bull-fight.
Bull-fight?
Are we going to a bull-fight?
Sure. A Portuguese bull-fight.
Is that guy Frink coming along?
Gee, isn't there any way we can get rid of that guy?
Somebody'll have to shoot him.
Not a bad idea at that.
I wonder if there's a bar inside or anything.
Sure, there IS a bar.
Let's find the bar.
We gotta get organized for the bull-fight.
Right this way.
Oh, boy! Lookit that bar, would ya?
Isn't that a beautiful thing?
What are you all gonna have?
- Beer is what I want.
I don't like beer.
Make you leap like a tuna.
Don't wanna leap like a tuna.
Make you bark like a fox.
- Don't wanna bark like a fox.
Make you laugh and play.
That's what I wanna do! Laugh and play!
Hey! Vermouth!
Well, men, fire and fall back!
What's the idea?
Well, I hope I don't catch a cold in my left ear.
Hey, drink your drinks!
We'll miss the parade!
Well! My old pal!
Nikki, here's a present for you.
- Oh, a hat!
Oh, senor, no, no, no - you must not keep the hat.
You must put a little present in it and return it to the matador after the fight.
What kind of present?
Well, eh - a little jewelry.
Something you have like the chain or the watch or the - the - the cigarette case or the cuff links or - or the -
Vanilla?
Yes! Vanilla!
Nice work!
What's so good about it?
He works close to the bull.
Is that so dangerous?
Sure, it's dangerous.
Bull-fighting is very dangerous.
It takes a lot of courage to go into the bull ring.
Is it true the bull is blind when he charges?
He sees only the cape - perhaps.
Bet I could run that bull bow-legged.
You know, I should have BEEN a bull-fighter.
You should have started at twelve years of old.
I bet I could start right now.
Sit still and behave yourself.
Bull-fighting is not for Americans.
You think we haven't got the nerve or something?
Why, listen,
Bull-fighting is just for us, the Latins.
He thinks we're a-scared!
He tackled a horse once.
Tackle a horse?
Is not the same!
Nice work, Tony!
Nice work, Joe!
Cary?
I slipped.
You were doing fine.
Wasn't I, though?
Heh. It's a cinch.
Bull-fighting?
Just as easy -
Hey, Doc? !
You know why I slipped, Cary?
No, Bill.
On account of that beer in my shoe.
Hey, Doc!
Cary, that bull certainly was hostile.
You hurt, Bill?
You all right, Bill?
Sure. I'm all right.
I was a big success.
He wants that we should go right away.
I'm sure glad that I - I wore my new blue shorts.
I'll be a big success in the hospital.
I'll send you my turtles, Bill. And THEN you'll be a big success.
So long, Bill.
See ya later
- Cary.
They've just put him to sleep.
Why, thank you, Nikki.
You'd better go back to the hotel.
Put Nikki in a taxi.
We'll wait here.
Senor,
The reporters want to know Why your friend descend into the bull ring.
Tell them - that it seemed like a good idea - at the time.
Sounds like old times.
Let's go and shoot.
Not a bad idea.
What say, Annie Oakley?
Like to fire off a gun at something?
No objection.
Hold everything.
First one to miss pays for the drinks.
What'll we shoot at?
Shoot one of those pussycats and see what happens.
Look out, pussycat.
Well, that's what I was aiming at, a clay pipe.
Whole thing's been misrepresented to me.
Cary, let's see you shoot something.
Look out, ball!
What'd YOU aim at?
Well, let's see you shoot something.
Oh, no, no, no, Nikki.
How do you hold it still?
Listen, Nikki, put it on your right shoulder.
Now, put your hand out there and hold up - No, don't cover up the site.
No, no, no, that's right.
Now just hold it evenly -
Show him up.
What are you waving at, Nikki?
Why, you fool.
Don't you know better than that?
Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki?
Put down that gun!
Let go of my wrist!
Put down that gun!
Listen, you keep your hands off me!
I've had enough from you!
You try any more of your rough stuff on me -!
Oh, so that's how it is. I thought we taught you how to behave.
You taught ME how to behave?
! Listen, you'd better behave now or you'll get hurt.
I'll give you three to put down that gun.
It'll be just too bad if you don't.
Too bad for who? !
Keep away from me!
I'll shoot, I tell ya! I'll shoot!
I'll shoot!
Francis?
Goodbye, Cary.
Come on, Shep.
That's the last of Francis, I'm afraid.
We'll never see him again.
Did you notice his eyes?
That's the first time I ever saw Francis really happy.
What'll happen to him, do you suppose?
Don't worry about Francis.
He'll take care of himself.
Let's walk.
No. Don't want to walk.
Let's take a cab.
Did you see the way Francis poured lead into that fellow?
Fast work.
Fast?
Chain lightning!
Those slugs went right past my ear.
If I'd've moved an inch, I would've caught one of them myself.
"Sudden Death," all right.
What's the matter with you, Shep?
I've never known you so quiet before.
I am kind of quiet.
Not smoking?
Your lighter working?
Good ol' Nikki - never has any matches.
Sure you want a light?
That's what I want, a light.
Shep!
- Shep's hurt!
Do something for him, Cary!
He's been shot!
What can we do, Cary?
! What can we do? !
Shep, why didn't you say you were hurt?
Good old Cary.
Sweet Nikki.
You may not believe it but this is the best thing that ever happened to me.
Oh, Shep, Shep, don't say that.
You'll be all right. We'll get you to a hospital.
No, no, Cary.
Don't rush me anywheres.
Let's sit here for a while.
The - Hurts, the jolting.
You know, Cary, I feel - just like we're fallin - long time ago.
Do you remember?
Spinning...
Spinning...
Only you brought me down safe.
Oh, Cary.
Good old Cary.
Best flyer in the service.
Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
We're gonna make a safe landing again, Shep.
Not this time, Cary.
Ol' Shep's gonna crash.
Say, but we're spinning fast.
Level off.
Cary, level off.
Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
Shep?
What are you writing, Cary?
A letter to Shep's mother.
Mind if I read it?
Why, Cary.
Cary, that's the most beautiful letter I've ever read.
Please forgive me for crying, Cary.
You don't mind if I cry just a minute, do you?
No, Nikki.
Can't you cry, Cary?
But you have cried sometime in your life, haven't you?
And you can't cry now?
Not even for Shep?
Shep Lambert spent his life in the war.
He had nothing more to give.
He had died once.
And he was ready to die again.
This time he was played out with music.
That was the way he wanted it.
And Bill Talbot was a big success in the hospital in his new blue shorts.
Maybe he'll tackle the angel Gabriel and - be a big success again.
Maybe Francis will forget to wind his chiming watch one day and go on sleeping.
Till the end.
Without them, nothing matters.
We only had each other.
Comradeship was all we had left.
And now that's gone, too.
And you, Cary? You?
You're alone now.
I don't want you to be alone, Cary.
Let me stay with you.
Let me be with you.
Why, Nikki.
Why, Nikki, you kept it.
You didn't forget.
No harm can come to our true love.
No harm can come to our true love?
Oh, Nikki, you've become very dear to me.
Can't I do something for you, too?
What can I get you?
Well, I've always wanted a pair of Spanish earrings.
It's for me, sir.
A soldier's work is never done
And though we never use a gun
We're still on active service though we're through with fighting
For when a lady takes the field she knows the guards will always yield
And every man deserves a medal every night
To arms To arms
We're used to night alarms
We're always facing powder
The girls give in We weaken, but we win
And march home feeling prouder
We're on a parade each evening in the park
We are not afraid to skirmish in the dark
We're famous near and far
For our rata, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Toujours I'amour in the army
We give the girls a rata-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta
When we go out campaigning
And they give us a rata, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
And so we are not complaining
For years and years we've battled every night
They'll pension us when we're too old to fight
We're the boudoir brigadiers
With a rata-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
It's for you, sir.
- Hello, Niki.
Oh, Niki, I'm in great trouble.
- No, no. No. It's not that.
It's something different, Niki.
Well, I've...
Well, I'm a married man.
Well, then, get a divorce.
Now, now.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm very fond of my wife.
She's refined.
In fact, I love my wife.
- And so, you see, if I should...
To cut a long story short, you're crazy about another girl.
- And you don't know what to do.
- Then don't do it.
Oh, but she's so beautiful.
And what a figure she has.
And, Niki, you should see her fingers.
She has the daintiest little fingers.
She plays the violin, you know.
And how.
She's the leader of a girls' band in a beer garden.
I've just come from there.
Oh, Niki, Niki. I've got to meet her.
Oh, but I've got to be so careful because I'm a married man.
Niki, Niki, look. You come to the beer garden with me?
You're afraid to have supper with her alone.
- And that's why you want me along.
- Right. - And after supper, I go home, and you don't go home.
- Right. - And you think I will lend myself to such an intrigue?
She plays the violin?
- I play the piano.
- Oh, that's great!
How do you like her?
What? You don't like her?
Do you know whom she reminds me of?
- This girl is beautiful.
- See here.
No, no, no, no. You're crazy.
Just picture your wife, 15 years younger... 20 pounds lighter, her hair dyed... her nose operated on... the same girl.
Exactly like your wife.
Always interrupting.
Beg pardon, madame.
Will you permit me to tell you... that I think you are the most beautiful, the most fascinating lady I have ever met?
You are very much mistaken, sir.
You haven't met me.
Oh, pardon me, please. That waltz you played so divinely, how does it go?
So, you play the piano.
Someday we may have a duet.
I love chamber music.
When hearts are singing... spring will remain.
Music is bringing... love once again.
Listen.
It calls you.
Now it is May.
Love while it sings to you.
Live for today.
Take what it brings to you.
Live for today
You want to go?
I like you too much.
Well, perhaps tomorrow night we could have dinner together.
Don't make me wait 24 hours.
Well, perhaps then we could have tea tomorrow afternoon.
Why not breakfast tomorrow morning?
First tea... and then dinner... and then maybe... maybe breakfast.
A dinner a supper for two
Believe me I know what to do
But breakfast is colder
Love seems much older
Yet the exception is you
You put kisses in the coffee
Such temptation in the tea
I get a thrill that sends a chill right through me
When you pass the toast to me
There's paradise in every slice of bacon
And you awaken
Such yearning when you beg for scrambled egg
And you put "it" in every omelet
Breakfast time This must be love
You put glamour in the grapefruit
You put passion in the prunes
I find romance each sweet, entrancing moment
Every time you touch the spoons
I must admit with every bit of liver
I start to quiver
I'm gone
When you invade the marmalade
And you put magic in the muffins
Breakfast time
This must be love
Telegram for His Majesty.
A telegram for His Majesty.
Flausenthurm without an "H"?
Don't they know in Vienna how to spell my country?
It's a deliberate insult, Papa.
They're trying to make us feel, just because we're a little country... we shouldn't have so many letters.
It's from the emperor himself.
"My dear cousin, as you cross the Austrian border...
"I extend to you and to your daughter, Princess Anna... my heartiest welcome".
"Unfortunately, I shall be unable to meet you at the station... as I have to open a cattle show".
Apparently cows are more important to him than we.
One goes to Vienna and one's own cousin doesn't even come to the station.
Trying to show off.
Big businessman.
That's always the way with relations.
Who are these people anyway?
A thousand years ago they were even smaller than we.
It's only in the last 700 years they've got anywhere.
Social climbers.
This sounds much better.
"You will, of course, be my guests at the palace.
My whole empire is at your convenience".
Turn out the guard!
Eyes right!
"My daughter is no laughing matter, states visiting king".
- And I hope you stick to it, Daddy.
- Always, my daughter.
Now, I hope you feel better.
I'm sorry, Father, but I don't.
This humiliation is too much.
I know a princess can't be insulted by a common lieutenant.
I should be far above that.
But besides being a princess... I'm a girl.
Your Majesty, we promise the fullest satisfaction.
This officer will be brought for trial at once before a military court.
I don't trust your courts. I don't trust your justice at all.
In your country, cows travel faster than kings.
That's graft.
I'll give him a fair trial.
Let him dare explain that laugh.
If he does, he'll hang.
No, but they can't punish you.
You never laughed at that small-town princess.
Why don't you tell them what really happened?
That would make it worse.
An officer on duty presenting arms before passing royalty... and smiling at the girl he loves.
No, there is no excuse from a military point of view.
But from my point of view...
what an excuse.
And remember. Remember what Napoleon said before he went to Elba:
The king himself.
You realize in whose presence you're standing?
Yes, sire.
In the presence of His Majesty King Adolf XV of Flausenthurm.
How do you spell Flausenthurm?
F-L-A-U...
S-E-N-T...
- U-R-M.
What a speller.
He certainly knows his alphabet.
What do you say to this?
Oh, this picture doesn't do you justice, Your Majesty.
Well, how do you like this?
Here. Here you look like a million dollars.
Oh, this is great!
That's what I call photography.
Just a dream.
Your Majesty, this interview is no laughing matter.
Right, Your Highness.
You laughed at a royal princess.
- Do you know the penalty?
- I know it, sire.
- Well, why did you do it?
- We want the truth.
Ladies of the ju...
I was standing at attention... presenting arms...
Looking straight ahead... and suddenly I found myself looking at the most beautiful girl.
How dare you call Her Royal Highness a girl.
That's my crime.
When I saw Her Highness... so young, so charming... so beautiful... I forgot everything, my rank, my duty.
My princess, now you know my crime.
If you consider me unworthy of my rank... I put my fate in your lovely little hands.
- You son of a gun.
Yes, sire!
I like the persons around me to look nice.
- Does that mean that I...
Father just talked with Uncle.
I mean, His Majesty has arranged it with the emperor... that you shall be our adjutant during our stay in Vienna.
I'm overwhelmed, Your Highness.
I hope you'll do your best to make us like Vienna.
Vienna speaks for itself, Your Highness.
If Your Highness will be good enough to look out of the window... there is the famous old tower of the Stephen's Church.
I don't care about these old buildings.
We have so many in Flausenthurm.
I like best things that are young and beautiful and alive.
- Oh, yes. Of course.
Tell me.
That you are so beautiful, Your Highness.
And then, when you thought I was so...
- So beautiful, Your Highness. - Yes.
Then... why did you smile?
Because I thought that you are so beautiful, Your Highness.
You see, I don't know very much about life.
I got all my knowledge out of the royal encyclopedia.
A special edition arranged for Flausenthurm... with all the interesting things left out.
Now, when you smiled at me, you also did something else.
Something with your eye.
- A wink.
A wink.
When we like somebody... we smile.
But when we want to do something about it we wink.
Niki!
An eight-hour day is enough, cherie
To act as the princess's guide
And that leaves a 12-hour night for me
So we'll all be quite satisfied
Tell me, Niki.
Is the princess a blonde or a brunette?
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
With 12 hours here and with eight hours there
Who gets the four hours in between
I must have a moment to comb my hair
And see that my buttons are clean
Oh, you see, Niki, it's not that I'm jealous... but someday you may meet a girl.
Nobody can play the violin like you.
Forget everything in the world but me
Forget if it's wrong or it's right
The more that we have to forget you see
Well, the more we'll remember tonight
He's gracious not audacious
And romance wakes at his touch
I like him.
I like him so much
I love you and I hate you
My darling what have I done
I'll thrill you till I kill you
You son of a gun
He's so mild like a sweet child
His conduct shows him as such
I like him
You devil Say you love me
Believe me you are the one
You brute, you I could shoot you
You put madness in the moonlight
T.N.T. in each caress
In every sigh you put such high explosive
I send out an S.O.S.
I see him now
So modest and so gentle
So sentimental
He has changed
The world for me
There's dynamite in all your kisses
You and I know this is love
Napoleon was a lieutenant too... and an Austrian princess married him.
- Well, he's no Napoleon.
He's 10 times better looking.
- Oh, Papa.
Don't you get tired of saying "no" all day long?
Now, now, no.
Papa, you may not realize it, but I'm desperate.
I'm no longer responsible.
If you don't let me have my lieutenant... you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to marry an American.
Give me the emperor.
Oh, good evening, Emp.
This is Adolf speaking.
Same to you.
Now listen, Emp.
I want to tell you something very confidential.
Now keep this under your crown.
My little Anna is in love.
You know all about it?
The whole palace knows?
She wants to marry him.
Now, what do you think of Anna marrying an ordinary lieutenant?
Oh, you think it's a great thing for Flausenthurm, eh?
Well, let me tell you, it's a great thing for Austria too. So long.
I'm not at home
Colonel Rockoff, His Majesty's adjutant... who is here in this room standing right beside me... wishes to see you.
Lieutenant, I'm here on a very confidential mission.
Her Highness, the Princess Anna, wanted to talk to you.
But before talking to you, naturally, she took up the matter with her father, His Majesty, the king.
His Majesty, the king, decided that Her Highness, the princess, should not talk to you first.
On the contrary, you should first talk to Her Highness, the princess.
But before talking to the princess, His Majesty, the king, wants you to talk to him... so that he can give you permission to talk to the princess.
May I ask what you are talking about?
In one word, Lieutenant, please don't you propose to the princess.
But I never intended to, and I never will.
My engagement to the princess?
I have inside information.
I had supper with the king last night.
Kings have to eat too.
Darling, you believe me.
I don't know a thing about this.
Of course. Of course I believe you.
Niki, they can't take you away from me.
I'll be back, and I won't be long.
You son-in-law!
Your Majesty, this has gone far enough.
The emperor's coming.
Now this is going too far.
Right, Your Majesty.
Flausenthurm is too far for me.
I'm a Viennese, and I love this city.
I can't live without Vienna.
You can't tear a tree out of the ground and plant it somewhere else.
Tree, tree, tree!
This has nothing to do with biology!
When you winked at my daughter, were your intentions honorable?
- Well, then naturally you'll marry her.
My intentions were dishonorable!
Then you will have to marry her.
Supreme and imperial majesty, the emperor.
We congratulate you.
It's a great thing for Austria... too.
We here with confirm, officially... the fact of your betrothal.
Do you, Colonel Rockoff, in the interest of the bridegroom, find everything fitting?
Do you, Baroness von Schwedel, in the interest of the bride, find everything proper?
Then you both agree that everything is fitting and proper?
I here with pronounce this royal bedchamber... a royal bedchamber.
Here with pronounce this royal wedding day... a royal wedding night.
- Aren't we married? - Yes!
- Aren't you my wife?
- Am I not your husband?
Now, can't I call you "dear" when I say good night?
Well, you may call me "dear,' but you shouldn't say good night.
But it's 9:30.
And at this hour, "good night" is the only proper thing to say.
- Yes, Anna?
Married people don't do that.
- They don't?
Married people don't wink?
Yes, they wink... but not at each other.
Well, what's the use of getting married?
All the philosophers, for 3,000 years... have tried to find that out... and they failed.
And I don't think we'll solve that problem tonight.
You can lead a horse to water... but you can't make him drink.
That's as far as I go.
That's my limit.
Black or white?
I don't want to play checkers!
Why don't you try it?
I personally ordered it for you.
- It's real Vienna schnitzel.
Schnitzel to you.
You are anti-Flausenthurm.
You wouldn't like this schnitzel even if it was good.
Schnitzel to me?
Ha! Let me tell you.
That schnitzel came from an imported Viennese cow.
Imported especially for you.
Poor cow.
To start life in Vienna... and end it in Flausenthurm.
As a gentleman, I say thank you.
As a Viennese, I say moo!
Down with that curtain.
You can't take her.
Now, that's what I call schnitzel.
You know, Niki, we shouldn't do this.
I shouldn't be here at all.
Oh, but I couldn't help it.
I had to see your wedding.
Just one glimpse of you as a prince... and then disappear.
But then I saw you yesterday.
In that marriage carriage?
Then I saw your face... so sad, so dreary... so lonesome... and I thought... I might just as well... hang around a little while.
But you cannot hang around in Flausenthurm... without being arrested.
When I saw you, I simply couldn't wait until the concert was over.
So I called the copper.
What's the use of being married to a princess... if you cannot use the police department?
Hello, folks. How's everything?
Great little kingdom you have here.
Ach, du lieber Flausenthurm Flausenthurm, Flausenthurm
And he called me Daddy.
Father, what does it mean when a man steps out?
Well, why, I-I don't know.
- You know who's stepping out?
Oh, well, now. Let me tell you what it means to step out.
So that's what she does, eh?
- Plays the violin.
Tell me, Papa.
Now, be frank.
Do all girls like that play the violin?
They play.
Well, I can play too.
- You want to arrest me?
You wonderful man! Go ahead, girls.
Go on. Come on.
Make yourself comfortable, as usual.
- From Vienna?
It's from Mandelbaum Gruenstein.
- Mandelbaum Gruenstein?
Oh, it's the only place to buy.
Oh, of course, they rob you, but it's worth it.
Who bought that for you?
Not Niki.
Niki has taste.
Did I hurt you?
Why did you get me here?
You poor little thing, you.
I love him so dearly.
I'm just wild about him.
- Isn't he good-looking?
- Oh, and how!
That's it exactly. "And how!"
- Did you see him in his new uniform?
- At the wedding?
But to tell you the truth, I like him even better in his dinner coat.
- With the straw hat?
With the straw hat!
Oh, that's nothing.
Did you ever see him in...
You listen to me, you foolish little thing.
If you don't watch out, someday a girl will come along and take him away from you.
- Oh, do you play?
"Etude for Five Fingers!"
"Cloister Bells"?
"Maiden's Prayer!"
Let me see your underwear.
"Cloister Bells!"
That's the kind of music you should play.
Jazz up your lingerie
Just like a melody
There's music when every ribbon has a flowing rhythm
Wear lace in harmony
A silken symphony
It's music and just the right note for you
Color should be seen
Let your step-ins have no dull or gray tones
Wear your crepe de chine with some pep
In up-to-date hey, hey tones
Be happy Choose snappy music to wear
Jazz up your teddy bear
I wonder if I dare
- Jazz up
- I'll try to
- Jazz
- I'd like to
- Come on
- I mean to
Wake up Try something new
That's what I've got to do
- Wake up
- I'll show them
- Great
- I'll teach them
- Get hot
- I'll try
- Tra-la-la, la-la
- Oh, not so hot
It sounds like 1850
You've got it now!
Let's simply jazz up your lingerie
Oh, now you mustn't worry about me.
I knew it all the time.
Girls who start with breakfast... don't usually stay for supper.
Take good care of our Niki.
And be a good girl.
Good-bye, Franzi.
Anna, is this you?
This is Mandelbaum Gruenstein.
And that's me again.
I've found at home my rata-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta
There'll be no more campaigning
And she'll find me Oh, rata-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta
And so I'm not complaining
I found a new commander to obey
I must report for duty right away
She'll never pension me

I told you to stop singing that awful song!
That same cursed song over and over!
Dear me, that's heavy.
I told those kids to stop singing that awful song, but they sing it all day long.
As if we haven't heard enough of that murderer already.
Leave them alone.
As long as we can hear them singing, at least we know they're still there.
Yes, I guess you're right.
PUBLIC SCHOOL
10,000 MARKS REWARD - WHO IS THE MURDERER?
Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara have been missing since June 11th.
Evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a crime similar to that committed last fall against the Doering siblings.
What a pretty ball you have there.
Elsie Beckmann.
Didn't Elsie come with you?
-She didn't come with us.
Pretty!
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.
Just a moment, Mr Gehrke.
Tell me, Mr Gehrke.
Have you seen little Elsie?
Didn't she just come up the stairs?
No, she's not home yet.
She won't be long now.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr Gehrke.
Extra! Extra! Extra!
No, I can't give change!
Makes you afraid to send your kids to school!
Who is the murderer?
Because the police did not publish my first letter, I am writing now directly to the press!
Proceed with your investigations. All will soon be confirmed.
But I'm not done yet!
10,000 MARKS REWARD
-Christ, here we go again!
-This is horrible!
The print's too small. We can't read it.
You in front, read it out loud!
-Let him read!
"The terror in our town has found a new victim."
We can't hear a word!
"Certain evidence leads us to believe that this is the same murderer who has already claimed eight victims from among our city's children.
A little candy, a toy, or an apple can suffice to lure a child to his or her doom."
Very true!
Keep reading.
"Anxiety among the general public is heightened by the police's failure to apprehend a suspect.
But the police are faced with the almost impossible task of catching a criminal who left not the slightest clue behind.
No one knows him, yet he is among us.
Anybody sitting next to you could be the murderer."
Yes, that's very true.
-Why look at me when you say that?
-You know very well.
What do I know very well?
Think about it. It'll come to you.
I saw you follow that little girl from the fourth floor up the stairs.
You're crazy, you dirty swine!
Who's the swine?
Me, or a man who chases little girls?
I'll see you in court!
I'll have you locked up!
Slanderer!
Trying to ruin my reputation!
Damn slanderer!
Besmirching a man's good name!
And the police fall for it!
A search warrant!
Searching a man's house based on an anonymous letter!
Mr Jäger, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.
As if it weren't enough that we're in constant fear for our kids!
You see? That's why the police must follow up every lead.
Any man on the street could be the murderer.
Can you please tell me what time it is?
Yes, my child.
Now you must hurry home.
What's it to you where the kid lives?
What do you want with that kid?
Absolutely nothing!
I'll show you what I want!
This is an outrage!
-This is an outrage!
-What does Four-Eyes want?
-Don't get so excited.
-First chatting up children...
-Punch him in the face!
...then acting like a big shot!
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!
-Get her alone, eh?
-And kill her like the others, right?
-He's the murderer!
-Hold him!
-Never around when you need 'em!
-Officer!
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.
Sure, you can catch pickpockets! Why don't you catch the murderer instead!
Is he the murderer?
Break it up!
Come on, move along!
-The murderer!
-The monster!
Tackle him!
MURDERER WRITES TO THE PRESS
This is a terrible scandal!
Imagine the effect such a note will have on the public, Commissioner!
This is simply irresponsible!
Mr Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer from writing to whomever he wishes!
This severely pathological man probably takes great pleasure in seeing his crimes covered in the press.
We immediately got in touch with the newspaper and had them send us the original letter.
The lab's working on it right now.
Of course, you can't get good fingerprints from a postcard that's passed through so many hands.
Nevertheless, we will leave no stone unturned.
We'll painstakingly compare the results against our archives in hopes of finding something that can be used to solve this case.
Then we'll send the letter to our graphologist.
"The aforementioned diamond-shaped and swelling sweeps, clearly seen in the word 'soon', third line from the bottom..."
-You got that?
"...attest to the strongly pathological sexuality of this sex offender."
Full stop.
The partially disrupted and uneven style of his other letters is, in its interpretation, a form of acting which may manifest externally as indolence or even lethargy.
The writing as a whole displays elusive yet unmistakable signs of madness.
Yes, of course, Commissioner.
I have no doubt you're doing your job, and your men as well.
But we need results!
Results!
Mr Secretary, my men haven't gotten 12 hours' sleep in an entire week!
My riot squads don't get a moment's peace.
They report for duty almost more fatigued than when they were dismissed.
because the painstaking nature of their work wears on the nerves, and 80%, if not 90%, of our leads are false.
The homicide squad doesn't even get time to change clothes.
They're constantly on call, always tense and alert.
ever ready to spring into action, to follow even the slightest lead, as it just might be the one that solves the case.
In the outermost corner were found traces of fruit drops and particles of powdered sugar.
We've tried to trace the origin of this wrapper in every candy shop and grocery store within a radius of a mile and a half, but all to no avail.
With each passing day we expand the area searched.
But, of course, after such a long time, no one remembers anything that could serve as a lead.
Our men are doing everything...
What good is all this?
Commissioner, I'm aware you're not dawdling, but that doesn't change the fact that an unknown killer is terrorizing four and a half million people!
And the police are getting nowhere!
Mr Secretary, you don't seem to have a clear picture of the enormous obstacles confronting our forces.
Do you realize, for example, regarding the route the child took home, that there are fifteen conflicting eyewitness accounts alone?
Let me give you a random example:
"Testimony 1,478 in the Beckmann murder case..."
-You've got no clue.
-More than you, mister!
You must at least know the color of the cap the little girl wore whom you say you saw with the stranger!
Of course, Inspector. It was red!
-It was green!
-Red!
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-You're welcome!
If you rely on a color-blind man for clues, don't be surprised if you get nowhere!
In their hunt for this unknown killer, the police have tracked down more than 1,500 detailed leads.
The files in this case fill 60 thick volumes.
We've dispatched all our forces to systematically comb the area adjoining the city.
Every piece of undergrowth is scoured, every thicket searched. every bush examined, since any bush or hollow could harbor some object that could finally set us on the right track.
We called in police dogs.
We set the best trackers on the faintest of traces, but they lost the scent and failed to pick it up again despite all efforts.
Since the first murders, the police have searched homeless shelters night after night, subjecting everyone in them to thorough scrutiny.
This does not, of course, make the police very popular, nor does it reduce the general public's anxiety.
Railway stations are kept under surveillance around the clock.
Still, the investigation has not yet yielded the slightest results.
nor have nightly raids in the criminal districts.
-This is the police!
Let me go, you dirty bastard!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
Goddamn bastard!
Let her go, you filthy pig!
Quiet!
The top fuzz!
Police orders:
nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.
Come now, children, stop this foolishness.
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!
Quiet!
That'll get you nowhere.
-Go after the murderer instead!
-Right!
Be reasonable now!
Come on, let's see those papers!
-I haven't got any.
-Let's see your papers.
Please let me go, Inspector!
The two guys who tried to escape were caught on the Krangasse.
-Leave those chairs alone!
Have your papers ready!
-Haven't we met before?
-Yeah. So?
Off to the precinct again!
Haven't even made a buck tonight!
Anyone without papers goes down to the precinct!
I tell you, I'm innocent, really!
Stop talking nonsense!
-Let's get moving!
-Kiss my arse!
-Show your papers! -Where's the paddy wagon?
Everyone will get their turn.
-Cool it, kids!
Inspector, I can't carry my birth certificate around with me everywhere!
-Quit your bellyaching, child.
-I really can't, Inspector!
The precinct for you!
You make me puke!
Shoddy work, my friend.
You've been had.
-Precinct.
-See you, Willy. Ta-ta!
Lay off!
Stuck-up snob.
-Papa Lohmann... -...nabbed him!
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S
We'd better take you down to the precinct too.
What do you mean? My papers are in order.
Tough luck!
-Papers.
-Don't got none.
To the precinct.
Next, come on.
You're ruining my business, Sarge. These raids every night.
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.
You think we stay up all night just for the hell of it?
But you're drivin' away my clientele, and you won't find the guy you're lookin' for here anyway.
If you knew how steamed they are at the guy who's causing these raids.
Sure, they solicit.
But believe me, in every one of them beats a mother's heart!
I know a lot of toughs who get all teary-eyed just seein' the little ones at play.
If they ever get their hands on that monster, they'll make toothpicks out of him!
Ready to leave, Sergeant.
They hit the Crocodile Club today.
Two paddy wagons.
What's keeping Safecracker?
Is it 3:00 yet?
I'll find out.
The exact time, please, miss.
2:58.
The cops are crawling the streets like ants again.
Green coats wherever you spit.
They're on your back even if you're with a broad.
They've gone nuts, got this murderer on the brain.
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl, and every night I have to check under the bed to see if the murderer's hiding there.
You can't do business anymore for tripping over cops everywhere.
There's no privacy anymore.
What else is new?
-Where the heck is Safecracker?
-Think they might have nabbed him?
Come on.
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once on a bank job he pulled in London.
No one better from Berlin to San Francisco.
They've been after him six years and they've yet to get him.
Not yet. But put enough dogs on the fox's tail...
I can't take this!
He was always right on time before.
-Thank God!
-Finally.
Close those blinds!
Gentlemen, I hereby open this meeting.
I declare all division leaders of this organization present.
I assume you're authorized to make binding decisions for your divisions.
We'll dispense with the preliminaries, as we all know why we're here.
An outsider is ruining our business and our reputation.
Measures taken by the police and the daily raids to catch this child murderer are hampering our activities to an almost unbearable degree.
We can no longer tolerate the fact that we're not safe now in any hotel, bar, café or even private home from the clutches of the police.
This state of affairs must end.
Things must return to normal or we'll go under.
Our coffers will soon be depleted.
If we can't get funds to support the wives of those members who currently enjoy room and board at state expense,
I don't know where we'll find the money to carry out our plans.
Our reputation is suffering as well.
The police seek the murderer in our fold.
Gentlemen, when I run head-on into an officer from the squad, he knows the potential risks, and so do I.
If either dies in the line of duty, fine. Occupational hazard.
But we must draw a firm line between ourselves and this man they're looking for!
We conduct our business in order to survive, but this monster has no right to survive!
He must be killed, eliminated, exterminated!
Without mercy or compassion!
Gentlemen, our members must be able to go about their business again without frantic cops in their way at every turn.
I invite your views, gentlemen.
Step up ID checks, comb the entire city, and raids, relentless, ever tougher raids!
We need informers!
We must know the police's plans almost before they do themselves!
The girls gotta work the cops more!
How often has one of us been nabbed because his girl ratted on him to the cops?
Now they can rat on the cops!
Every resident, every landlord, every property owner must be forced to consent to meticulous searches of his property for the slightest of clues.
What if we...
We have our connections.
He's not even a real crook!
This man may well be, when not engaged in the actual act of killing, a harmless, upstanding citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.
In his right mind, perhaps he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or plays cards with friends.
This is where we must focus the public's attention.
The public must cooperate.
I'll tell you about public cooperation!
Just thinking of it makes me puke.
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.
But ain't it the truth?
What the devil has public cooperation gotten us so far?
Piles of letters full of the most outrageous slander!
Very true.
They alert homicide whenever a chimney sweep walks by.
But when you really want reliable information from them, then they suddenly haven't got a clue.
Why, they just can't seem to remember a thing.
There's your public cooperation for you!
I believe you're exaggerating a bit, Lohmann.
It can't really be that bad, can it?
But it is, Commissioner!
Most of the public still takes the position,
"How does this concern me?".
The idea that each individual is responsible for what happens to the poorest, most anonymous child on the street hasn't even dawned on the public at large!
There was this magician.
Te...
Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.
Anyway, he could conjure up hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.
The reward is still far too little money.
The man who leads us to the murderer should get a fortune.
None of this is anything new.
This is all leading nowhere.
So we just wait for the police to catch the guy instead?
The difficulties in solving crimes of this nature are, in my experience, often insurmountable, since perpetrator and victim are often brought together by mere chance.
The instincts of the moment drive the murderer's actions.
The victim is found and identified, his or her last known whereabouts are determined, and then... then comes the big question mark.
These children vanish without a trace. And when they're found...
Well, we all know the state in which we've found them.
And the perpetrator...
It's a fact well-known to all of us that murderers like this rarely leave a clue behind.
That's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.
The police have been after this murderer for eight months now.
-They'll only get him by accident now.
-We can't wait for that.
No, we'll go broke by then.
What, then?
We have to catch him ourselves.
Yes, that's what we must do.
There is perhaps one other way.
I'm quite certain that information on the individual in question must already exist somewhere.
Being the severely pathological case that he is, he has no doubt already had some kind of contact with the authorities.
That's why all health care facilities, prisons, clinics and insane asylums must be encouraged to cooperate with us unequivocally.
We specifically need information on those released after being deemed harmless to society but who, due to their inclinations, could be the murderer.
We must cover the city with a net of informers.
Every square mile must be under constant surveillance.
No child in this city must take a single step without us knowing it.
-Fine, but how?
-And who?
In short, people whom the killer would never suspect.
-But who?
-There are no such people!
-Who could do that?
The beggars.
The organization of beggars!
MR CREDIT IS DEAD AND BURIED - THE MANAGEMENT
Blood pudding's on the upswing.
God, this cheese stinks so good.
Take that, you sons of bitches!
Hey, stop snoring.
You'll wake up the lice.
Two, four, six...
NO BEGGARS OR PEDDLERS
SANDWICHES
Bread-and-butter sandwich, lukewarm response.
Black Friday for roast beef.
All right. Now come the courtyards.
Yes, from number 1 to 88.
You're responsible for the courtyards on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.
Hauptstrasse, from number 89...to 196.
Hauptstrasse, number 89 to 196.
-Member number? -3795.
Emil Dustermann.
Well, Emil, maybe you'll win the 15,000.
Knock on wood.
My heartfelt thanks, ladies and gentlemen.
In searching homes, be on the lookout for any clue which could establish the origin of the murderer's letter to the Courier.
Be on the lookout as well for an old wooden table...
...or red pencil...
... or writing paper of the type used by the killer.
Inspector, here are reports on mental patients who've been released as cured or deemed harmless over the last five years.
Reports from every private and public institute, as well as from municipal hospitals and asylums.
And here's a list of their present addresses.
Does a Mr Beckert live here?
-Does a Mr Beckert live here?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
You don't say.
Does a Mr Beckert live here?
Mr Beckert, yes, he does. But he just stepped out.
I had hoped to speak with him.
I'm from the tax office.
The tax office.
Oh, my Lord!
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...
-Please have a seat.
-Perhaps you'd like something to read.
Tell me, Mrs Winkler, does Mr Beckert subscribe to any newspapers?
Mr Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.
I wanted to meet you halfway!
Child, you mustn't do that.
No, a vermouth. No, a cognac.
Two cognacs... That's 1.65, please.
"Number 24:
Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier.
Table: polished mahogany, with tablecloth.
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.
Printed matter found in wastebasket: cigar ad and a postcard with flowers and 'Regards, Paul' on it, but no address of sender.
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand, a bag of candy..."
Just a moment.
Ariston?
What was that?
I'd like the file on the Marga Perl murder case.
It was... It was...
Hey, Heinrich!
Someone's whistling.
Now he's stopped.
Did you see the guy who was whistling?
Yes, I can still see him.
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl and walking her down the street.
-After him, quick, and don't lose him!
The day little Elsie Beckmann was killed, a man bought a balloon from me.
He was with a little girl and he whistled just like that!
Damn it, man!
Are you crazy, throwing orange peels on the ground?
A man could slip and break his neck!
I should report you to the police! Outrageous behavior!
Hey, mister.
Here it is.
"In a 150-foot radius of the crime scene, three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand were found." There you have it.
Yes, it may be the same brand of cigarettes, but there was no old wooden table.
Of course, he could have written that letter somewhere else.
Good God!
The window ledge!
Red pencil.
My God, finally!
We're finally on his trail.
They're on his trail?
-Did they find him?
-The beggars found him.
-His whistling gave him away.
-They put a mark on him.
Shut up!
They're following the mark.
-Mister.
-You got some white stuff on your coat.
On your shoulder.
Here, I'll wipe it off.
-Come on. We're leaving.
He didn't come out this way. We would've seen him.
Out of the question!
-Well, he didn't turn back.
-He has to be somewhere, damn it!
Maybe he's hiding inside the building.
Closing time!
We can't let him get away in the crowd! If he slips through now...
They're starting to come out!
Out in the street, and keep your eyes peeled!
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Königsberg...
No, in my condition I can't eat anything like that...
The boss came to my office today...
Turn off the light. He'll get suspicious if he comes home and sees it on.
Almost 6:30.
He's gotta still be inside! He definitely didn't come out with the office crowd.
No, just a moment.
The beggars have called for backup and surrounded the whole building.
They figure the guy's hiding in the building.
What sort of building is it? What sort of building is it?
Nothing but offices.
I don't know what's in the basement.
There's a branch of the local savings bank on the ground floor, and the second to sixth floors are nothing but offices. Above that is the attic space.
Anyone still in there?
Anyone still in here?
What the devil!
Anybody still in here?
Damn carelessness! All that trouble for one door.
Seems the guy's cornered now.
I think we should tip the cops off right away.
-Let's not waste time!
Stay by the phone and call back in a few minutes.
Are you crazy or something?
We're gonna get this guy ourselves!
Listen, the time now is... 8:00.
All right. 9:00, 10:00...
At 11:00!
Did you know your gate isn't closed?
That's impossible!
Why I just... Wait, it is!
Open up, quick! And not a sound!
Come on! Move it!
Let's go!
Come on, move it!
How many other watchmen are in the building?
Don't want to answer?
There are still two watchmen on their rounds.
Damn piece of crap!
Goddamned lock!
Damn it to hell!
Careful where you shine those lights!
And don't stomp around like elephants!
He's not in the basement.
We went through it all and found nothing.
Two men are still going through the boiler room.
Go up and join Emil.
Safecracker sent me.
Listen carefully.
This is a new type of time clock.
Here's a general diagram.
If they're not set at exactly the right minute, an alarm automatically goes off at the nearest police station. Get it?
-I'm not an idiot!
He's not in the boiler room or the coal room.
We turned over every piece of coal.
Hey! Are you nuts?
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?
We gotta get in if we're gonna search the whole place!
But not through the door, you idiot!
Go through the ceiling of the office above!
All right. Down we go.
Answer me, damn it!
-What's going on?
-I heard some banging!
-Where are you off to?
-Why are you running?
I've gotta see Safecracker!
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!
Go on!
He has to be in there!
Here's the light switch.
Force the locks.
I found the guy! He's in the attic!
I heard someone banging, and I told Safecracker.
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.
Just came down to fill you in.
If I hadn't been alert, we could've looked for him for hours!
The watchman!
Three...one...four.
-Everybody out!
-The cops will be here in five minutes.
-Damn it!
-The watchman rang the alarm.
-Let's scram!
Five more minutes, six more storage sheds.
Move it!
Get going!
Out of the way!
-He's not in here.
-Next door!
-He's not here either.
-Move on!
Next door!
We've only got three minutes left!
No padlock on this one...
He must be here!
Open it!
-Something's jammed inside.
-Let me do it!
Hurry! Only one minute left!
There he is, the dog!
Come on! Move it!
Get out while you can, damn it!
Move it!
For Christ's sake, get going!
-What's keeping the others?
-They're coming!
If not, they might as well stay here, with or without the guy!
What in the hell is keeping them?
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!
He's not down here.
Who pulled up the rope?
Hey, who pulled up the rope?
Bunch of morons!
How can I put my hands up when I'm holding on to the rope?
I'm really innocent this time like a newborn babe.
This may surprise you, Franz but I believe you.
Then everything's in order, and I can go now, right?
Uh-oh.
I'll take your word for it, Franz, provided you can tell me
who the man was that you were looking for and that you found in that building.
I don't understand, Inspector.
A man, you say?
There's just one thing I don't get: why you're covering up for the gang who left you in the lurch.
Fine friends, running off when things heat up, leaving you right in the fire.
Phooey!
That ploy won't work with me, Inspector.
What can happen to me anyway?
Maybe a little property damage, so what?
Nothing was pinched!
But something was pinched, my friend!
In fact, a good deal.
Something got pinched?
Tell me what you know and I'll do the same.
I already told you. I know nothing.
Give it some thought, Franz.
Leave a man alone for a couple hours and a lot comes back to him that he couldn't remember before.
Send the night watchman in.
Mr Damowatz.
Now then, you said in your statement...
Listen carefully, in case you have to testify under oath later.
You clearly heard one of the burglars say to the guy guarding you,
"We got him.
I found the guy.
He's in the attic."
-Yes, Inspector.
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.
Go home now and recover from your ordeal.
But please remain available for further questioning.
Of course, Inspector.
Good morning, Inspector.
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann in the building?
He's talking to someone?
I'll come over myself.
Hasn't come home yet, eh?
Did you keep an eye on the old Winkler woman too?
-Am I disturbing you?
-No, come in.
Listen, the whole block is surrounded.
If he decides to go home, he has to run into us.
So just keep on waiting.
If anything happens, I'll be here at the precinct.
Damn it!
I wanted to ask a favor of you.
Dishwater again!
Read this first.
-A statement?
An office building was broken into.
Bennostrasse?
That's a respectable part of town.
Perhaps not that respectable after all.
Hell, this is getting serious!
What the... Did they mean to empty the brothel?
What could they have been looking for in the coal?
Incredible!
I'll be damned!
This is madness!
So they were after the savings bank!
What could this mean?
I don't understand at all.
They didn't even touch it?
Must've been a bunch of real idiots!
I'll be damned!
Isn't that something?
Nothing stolen, but a man was carried off.
God knows where they took him.
That's just great.
And Franz isn't talking.
He's afraid, of course.
Guys like him would rather jump out the fifth-floor window than be mixed up in a murder rap.
What if we could get at him from that angle?
Lohmann, if you'd be willing to help me out...
I see the wheels turning.
Let's send for this Franz.
You're wanted for questioning.
They sent four guys for me?
-What's this about?
-Move it!
"Homicide squad.
Inspector Karl Lohmann."
What have I got to do with the homicide squad?
Yes, young man, your case has been turned over to me.
You boys did your work a little too well.
One of the watchmen...
Nasty business.
Inspector, I've had enough!
I want no part of this!
I'll tell you everything I know!
Very sensible, but, unfortunately, too late.
It can't be too late!
I'll tell you everything!
Even what we were looking for in that damn building.
Well...
The child murderer!
The child murderer, Inspector.
This had to happen to me!
Me, of all people.
Come sit down, my boy.
We're gonna level with each other, got it?
Certainly, Inspector.
And God help you if you pull something.
Now then, what have you boys got to do with the murderer and where was the guy taken?
Well, Inspector you know the old Kuntz Ley distillery?
The one that went belly-up in the Depression?
Since then, the building's stood empty, and no one gives a damn about it.
Get out here!
Move it!
What have I done to you?
You swine!
Swine!
I want out!
Let me out of here!
You'll never get out of here.
Gentlemen, I beg of you!
I don't even know what you want with me.
I beg you, let me go.
This whole thing must be a mistake!
A mis...
This is no mistake.
You recognize this?
You bought a balloon just like this for little Elsie Beckmann.
Just like this one.
Where did you bury little Marga Perl, you bastard?
But I never...
I never even met her!
You never even met her!
I suppose you never met her either?
Or her?
You never met her either?
-Stop him!
-Grab him!
-Don't let him escape!
-Let me out!
-Punch him in the face!
-You have no right to treat me this way!
-We'll show you we do!
You have no right to hold me here!
Right?
There's only one thing right for a man like you - death!
-Right! Kill him!
-Kill the rabid dog!
-Ice him! -Let him have it!
You spoke of right just now.
We will be your right.
Everyone sitting here is an expert in the rule of law!
From six weeks in Tegel prison to 15 years in Brandenburg.
They'll make sure you get your rights. You'll even have defense counsel.
Everything according to the letter of the law.
Defense counsel?
I need no defense counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?
You, perhaps?
If I were you, I wouldn't make big speeches.
Your head's at stake here, in case you hadn't noticed.
I have the dubious pleasure of serving as your defense.
Though I'm afraid it won't do you much good.
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?
We simply want to put you out of commission.
And we'll only be sure of that when you're dead.
But you can't murder me just like that!
I demand to be handed over to the police!
I demand to be brought before a real court of law!
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?
-Look who's talking!
So you can plead insanity and spend the rest of your life being cared for by the state.
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!
But I can't help it!
I really can't...help it!
We know that one!
Before the judge, we all "can't help it".
Who are you anyway?
All of you.
Probably proud of it, too.
Proud you can crack a safe or sneak into houses or cheat at cards.
Can I do anything about it?
Don't I have this cursed thing inside me? This fire, this voice, this agony?
So you mean to say you have to kill?
I have to roam the streets endlessly, always sensing that someone's following me.
I'm shadowing myself!
Silently...but I still hear it!
Yes, sometimes I feel like I'm tracking myself down.
I want to run, run away from myself!
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!
I must take the path that it's driving me down and run and run down endless streets!
I want off!
And with me run the ghosts of the mothers and children.
They never go away.
They're always there!
Always! Always!
Except when I'm doing it.
Then I don't remember a thing.
Then I'm standing before a poster, reading what I've done.
I read and read...
I did that?
I don't remember a thing!
But who will believe me?
Who knows what it's like inside me?
How it screams and cries out inside me when I have to do it!
Don't want to! Must! Don't want to!
Must!
And then a voice cries out, and I can't listen anymore!
I can't!
I can't!
The accused has stated that he can't help himself.
In other words, he must commit murder.
With that he has pronounced his own death sentence.
A man who claims that he's compelled to destroy the lives of others, such a man must be extinguished like a bonfire!
Such a man must be obliterated!
Wiped out!
May I address the court?
Counsel for the defense has the floor.
My learned colleague who just spoke, who is, if I'm not mistaken, wanted by the police on three counts of manslaughter...
That's irrelevant here.
...has claimed that the fact that my client was acting compulsively warrants the death sentence.
He is mistaken, because the very nature of compulsion warrants an acquittal!
Get outta here, will you?
Are you nuts, or plastered?
It is precisely the nature of compulsion that relieves him of responsibility for his actions!
And a man cannot be punished for that for which he is not responsible!
-You mean this monster should go free?
That he should live?
I'm saying that this man is sick, and you turn a sick man over to a doctor, not an executioner.
-Will you guarantee his cure?
-What does the state build asylums for?
-What if he breaks out?
-Or he's declared cured and released?
And one fine day the killing starts all over?
Another month-long manhunt!
Once again the insanity clause, once again the asylum!
Another breakout or possible release! And again "must kill"!
Is this supposed to go on indefinitely?
No one has the right to kill a man who cannot be held responsible for his crimes!
Not even the state, and all of you least of all!
The state must ensure that this man is rendered harmless so that he ceases to be a danger to society!
You never had kids, did you?
Then you never lost any either.
But if you wanna know what it's like when a little child is taken from you, just ask the parents whose kids he took away!
Ask them about the days and nights not knowing what had happened, and later, when they finally found out...
Why don't you ask the mothers?
You should ask the mothers!
Think you'd get mercy from any of them for murdering their kids?
-The woman's right!
-Absolutely!
No mercy for the killer!
-Let him have it!
-Slaughter the bastard!
-Kill the monster!
-Put the animal to death!
-Rub him out!
-Waste him!
-Get rid of him!
-Annihilate the monster!
I will not let you shout me down!
I will not allow a murder to be committed in my presence.
I demand that this human being...
That's not a human being!
...that this human being be afforded the same protection under the law rendered the common criminal!
Not a chance!
I demand that he be handed over to the police!
Of all the dumb...
In the name of the law...
In the name of the people...
This will not bring our children back.
One has to keep closer watch over the children!
All of you!
Bye-bye, honey.
Honey, have I any more important engagements this afternoon?
Yes, sir.
There's a girl outside to see you, Sam.
Her name's Wonderly.
- A customer?
You'll see her anyway.
She's a knockout.
Okay, honey, send her in.
Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?
Mr. Spade, could you...
Perhaps it would be easier if you started from the beginning.
She met him there.
Then it's your sister you're concerned about.
And I must get her back home before Mother and Father return from Europe.
That's two weeks.
Oh, that's plenty of time.
Spade and Archer.
Hello, Effie, this is Iva Archer speaking.
Say, is my husband there?
No, he isn't, Iva.
He isn't back from his trip yet.
Well, then put Sam on the phone.
He is in conference now.
Tell him it's very important.
All right, hold the wire.
I'll switch your call to his office.
Mrs. Archer on the phone.
Will you excuse me just a minute?
- Hello, Sam.
Oh, I'm terribly lonesome, and I just had to talk to you.
Oh, hello, Mr. Archer.
Have a good trip?
Yeah, yes, I had a good trip.
Found out what I wanted to know.
Effie, will you put these in on my desk, please?
And get out the other papers in the case, too, will you?
Yes, Mr. Archer.
Now you be sensible about it.
Don't do anything rash.
Things will work themselves out.
You sound so cold.
Is there somebody there that you can't talk to me like you used to?
Call me soon. I'll be waiting.
Very strange case.
Woman lost a dog last night and wants us to find it for her.
I thought you were alone.
Miss Wonderly, my partner, Miles Archer.
How do you do, Mr. Archer?
Miles, Miss Wonderly's sister ran away from New York with a man named Floyd Thursby.
- Thursby?
They're here in town.
She located Thursby, but he won't tell her where her sister is.
She wants a man to follow Thursby until we find out just where he's hiding her sister.
Well, how do we pick up this man Thursby?
Miss Wonderly's gonna meet him tonight at her hotel at 8:00.
And I think it would be safe for you if you met him in the lobby.
But you must be careful.
I'm so afraid of what he might do... to her.
You think he's dangerous?
I don't think he'd stop at anything to save himself.
We know how to take care of him, all right.
Now, don't you worry, Miss Wonderly.
Mr. Spade, could either you or Mr. Archer...
Could either of you handle this matter personally?
I'm so afraid about the whole thing, and I'd feel so much safer.
I'd be willing to pay most anything if you would.
Would that be enough?
I'll look after this myself.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Archer.
- And thank you, Mr. Spade.
You've both been very kind.
Any phone calls for me, Sam?
- Oh, yes, your wife called.
What did she have to say?
Oh, wanted to know when you were coming home.
And she said she missed you an awful lot.
Yes, I'll be right over.
Yes, I'll hurry.
I thought you'd want to take a look at the body before we took it away.
Got him right through the pump with this.
And fired so close, the powder burned his overcoat.
Archer didn't have time to draw.
His gun was tucked away in his hip pocket.
- Better take it.
I guess it's up to you to break the news to the widow, ain't it?
Say!
Ain't you gonna take a look at him before you go?
What's the use, Tom?
Nothing I can do to bring him to life.
Come on in, precious.
- Who were you expecting, darling?
- You, sweetheart.
Was Archer working tonight, Sam?
Supposed to be tailing a guy named Thursby.
Well, for the swell reason that we've got a client that's paying us good old-fashioned American coin to have him tailed.
Did you break the news to Archer's wife, Sam?
- How did she take it?
I don't know much about these women.
The devil you don't.
I warned you your foot would slip sometime, Spade.
Everybody's foot slips sometime.
Yeah, and this is your time.
- What kind of a gun do you carry?
You don't happen to have one around here anyplace?
- Are you sure of that?
- Well, have a look around.
If you find one, I'll make you a present of it.
I told you I didn't have any.
You've told me a lot of things tonight that didn't mean anything.
I tell just what I wanna tell.
You'll tell me just what I wanna know, or you'll tell it in court.
This is murder, and don't you forget it.
Listen, Dundy, it's a long time since I burst into tears because a policeman didn't like me.
Well, you listen to me, Spade.
At 1:00 tonight, Archer was murdered.
Another man named Floyd Thursby was shot down in front of his hotel
35 minutes after you left Archer in the alley.
Take your dirty paws off me!
What have I got to do about all this?
Tom says you were in such a hurry you didn't even stop to look at your dead partner.
I couldn't get sentimental over Archer, dead or alive.
And you didn't go to Archer's house to tell his wife.
You sent the girl from your office.
Well, now that you got it all figured out, maybe you can tell me how I killed Thursby. I've forgotten.
As he started to go into his hotel, he was shot three times in the back with a. 45 from across the street.
Nobody saw it, but that's the way it figures.
You may as well know it, if you don't.
Thursby died before he could tell anybody who shot him.
I never saw Thursby dead or alive.
Now get out of here and let me get some sleep, will you?
You can't give us the runaround this way.
- The D.A. Is gonna hear about this.
Well, what I said to you goes for the D.A., double in spades.
What do you think of that, Mr. Dundy?
- Mr. Spade.
- Good morning, Mr. Spade.
I didn't expect to see you.
I thought Mr. Archer was to call.
Mr. Archer couldn't come.
Too bad we couldn't find that little sister of yours.
Mr. Spade, I have a terrible confession to make.
That story I told you yesterday wasn't true.
We didn't believe you.
But we believed your $200.
You know, darling, for that amount of money, I'd let you tell me a lie every day.
Well, when I told you that I expected Mr. Archer, I lied again.
I know what's happened.
But you'll go on with the case just the same, won't you?
That all depends.
There have been two murders committed.
That stirs up the police and makes things more expensive and harder to handle.
You don't think I had anything to do with those murders?
- I forgot to ask you that.
Say, listen.
There are a flock of policemen, assistant district attorneys and reporters outside, running around with their noses to the ground.
- Can't you keep me out of it?
But I've gotta know what it's all about.
But I can't explain.
Not just now, I can't.
I haven't anyone else, and I need help so badly.
I'll explain later, when I can.
But I can't, not just now.
You see, I trusted Thursby, and he betrayed that trust.
But I'm depending on you to save me.
Why, if I hadn't believed that with all my heart, I would have run away yesterday instead of coming to you.
I know I haven't any right to ask you to help me blindly.
But I do ask it.
Oh, be generous, Mr. Spade.
You won't need much of anybody's help.
You're pretty good.
As a matter of fact, you're very good.
It's chiefly your eyes, I think, and the throb that you get in your voice when you say, "Oh, be generous, Mr. Spade. "
I really needed your help, needed it desperately.
- Now, now, don't get your feathers up.
Tell me all about Thursby, and tell me the truth.
I met him in the Orient.
We came here together from Hong Kong about a week ago.
Why did you want him shadowed?
By the time we landed, I was afraid I couldn't trust him.
- Did he kill Archer?
- Of course.
With the gun he always carried in his overcoat pocket.
- You've seen it then, huh?
He never wore an overcoat without it.
- Why all the guns?
- He was afraid of being caught unaware.
He always covered the floor around his bed with crumpled newspapers so no one could approach without making a noise.
You picked a nice playmate.
- The only kind that could help me.
- Help you do what?
- Say, how bad a hole are you actually in?
- As bad as could possibly be.
Physical danger?
I'm not heroic.
I don't think there's anything worse than death.
Then it's that, eh?
As surely as we're sitting here, unless you help me.
How am I gonna help you?
You haven't told me anything.
- Who killed Thursby?
- Your enemies or his?
- His, I hope, but I'm afraid.
- You're impossible.
- You won't go to the police, will you?
- Go to them?
Why, all I have to do is stand still and they'll be swarming all over me like a bunch of bees.
I'm gonna tell them all I know, and you take your own chances.
Say, have you got any money?
I've only got about $500 left.
Let me have it.
- Now, don't ask any questions.
Hey, there's only $400 here.
Well, I have to have something to live on.
Haven't you got anything you can raise some money with?
A few pieces of jewelry.
Afraid you'll have to hock 'em, honey.
- I'll call you when I get some news for you.
Oh, look, Effie, have them take Spade and Archer off the door and put Samuel Spade on it instead, will you, honey?
It's a gorgeous new customer.
- Gorgeous?
- A knockout!
Send her right in, honey.
Will you step in, please?
- Sit down, Doctor.
Well, sir, what can I do for you?
Allow me first to offer condolences for your partner's unfortunate death.
Was there, as the newspapers indicated, any connection between his death and the death of the man Thursby?
Why should there be?
- What kind of an ornament?
- A statuette.
The black figure of a bird.
I am prepared to pay, on behalf of the owner, the sum of $5,000 for its recovery.
And I can promise you that no questions will be asked.
- Not a thing, honey.
- And lock the door as you go out.
$5,000 is a lot of money.
You will please clasp your hands together at the back of your neck.
What are you doing, kidding me?
Okay, Doctor.
I'm going to search your office, Mr. Spade.
And if you attempt to prevent me, I shall certainly shoot you.
I must see that you're not armed.
Why did you strike me after I was disarmed?
But you could imagine my embarrassment, Doctor, when I found your $5,000 offer to be nothing but a lot of baloney.
It was a genuine offer.
I am prepared to pay you $5,000 for the statuette's return.
- Do you have it?
If it's not in this office, why should you risk your life to prevent my searching for it?
What do you expect me to do?
Sit around here and let people come in and stick me up?
I see you've got my apartment address.
Have you been there, too?
While I am ready to pay $5,000 for the statuette, I naturally wanted to save the owner that expense.
Who is the owner?
- What does this black bird look like?
It's a figure, about 12 inches high, in black enamel.
But remember, you're not hiring me to go out and murder or steal.
You simply want me to get the black bird for you in a lawful and honest way.
At least with discretion.
I'm at the Hotel Belvedere if you should wish to communicate with me.
- Good afternoon, Doctor.
- May I have my gun, please?
Go ahead and search, Doc.
You're paying for it.
Been waiting long?
I came over the moment I got your message.
I saw your friend Cairo today.
Do you know Cairo?
He offered me $5,000 for the black bird.
Surely you're not considering it?
But, Mr. Spade, you promised to help me.
Now, don't let's try to figure out how much you've trusted me.
I promised to help you, sure, but you didn't say anything about any black birds.
You won't... Why, you can't treat me like this.
It's more than I can afford to pay you for your loyalty.
That's good, coming from you.
Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else?
Well, if I'm peddling it, I'm selling to the highest bidder.
I love your apartment, Sam.
Don't you ever get lonesome?
Saw your light.
Thought we'd come up and talk to you.
Go ahead and talk.
Love of Mike, you're not gonna make us stand out here, are you?
Afraid you'll have to, Tom.
I can't let you in.
So you won't play along with us.
Still going it alone.
Say, what's on your mind beside your hat?
Just this, there's a lot of talk going around that you and Archer's wife were pretty thick.
Any truth in it?
There's even talk that's why he was put on the spot.
Why don't you stop trying to be a hog, Dundy?
You shouldn't try to pin more than one murder on me.
- I haven't pinned anything on you.
- I know you haven't.
All you've done is sneak around here after hours
- and ask me a lot of silly questions.
- And get a lot of lying answers.
Well, maybe you're right, bucking us.
Glad to see you anytime, Lieutenant.
Drop around when I'm not so busy.
I'll let you in.
Any more of your tricks, and I'll finish you.
Maybe you can tell me.
She hit me over the head.
She would have killed me.
On my word of honor.
Miss Wonderly, I'd like you to meet Lieutenant Dundy and Detective Sergeant Polhaus.
Miss Wonderly is an operator in my employ.
And an old college chum of mine, Dr. Cairo from back East.
The two of them indulging in a friendly little argument, huh?
- I can easily explain that, Lieutenant.
- I'll bet you can.
Miss Wonderly never saw Dr. Cairo before.
And when he came into my apartment by the back way,
- well, naturally, she was frightened.
- Oh, I was.
I was terribly afraid.
And I'm so glad you aren't a burglar, Dr. Cairo.
- You will forgive me, won't you?
- Why, most certainly, mademoiselle.
Why should your dear old college chum go and come through the back door?
I'm sure, I don't know.
Joel, why did you?
Why, as a matter of fact, I have a large sum of money on me, and, naturally, I was alarmed at being trailed.
I'm not usually timid, but in a strange city one never knows.
If I may go with you when you leave, I'll feel much safer.
Rather a brief visit, your old school friend is making.
You won't mind, Sam, will you, if I go along with these gentlemen?
Not at all, Joel.
- Come and see me again sometime soon.
- Why, I certainly will.
I'm sorry this little thing happened.
Oh, that's all right, that's all right.
And Miss Wonderly, is she also afraid to go home in the dark?
Miss Wonderly is taking some notes that I haven't finished as yet.
In that case, we'll leave you to your conference.
If those detectives are waiting outside for me, they're going to have a long wait.
You can take my bedroom.
I'll sleep out here.
I hope I won't be putting you out.
Are you comfortable, honey?
Come on, dear, tell me all about that black bird.
Oh, I'm so tired, Sam.
Tired of everything, of myself, of lying, of thinking up lies until I don't know a lie from the truth.
I wish I...
Don't shoot, honey.
It's only Sam the grocery man.
- I went down to get the groceries.
I'm sorry I frightened you, babe.
I'll get breakfast ready, if you run my bath for me.
That's fair enough, sugar.
- Hello, Iva.
How are you, honey?
I came to talk to you, Sam.
- Can't I go in?
- I'm very busy right now.
I came to talk to you, and I'm not going to stay out here.
Who's that dame wearing my kimono?
Now behave yourself, honey.
I suppose I haven't any right where you're concerned.
Well, I thought I had.
I thought your pretending to love me gave me some.
Well, let's not talk about that now.
Just to talk to you, Sam.
All right.
If you won't listen to me, I know someone who will.
Lieutenant Dundy might be interested in what I've got to say.
I'll be seeing you.
All quiet?
Everything's under control, honey.
You have a lot of trouble with your women, don't you, Sam?
Here's to plain speaking and clear understanding.
- A cigar, sir?
- You're a close-mouthed man, sir.
- I like to talk.
- We'll talk if you like.
And I'll tell you right now that I'm a man who likes to talk to a man who likes to talk.
- Let's talk about the black bird.
- Splendid. Splendid.
No beating about the bush, straight to the point.
- Let's get to the point.
You are here, Mr. Spade, as Miss Wonderly's representative?
I'm here looking out for myself.
That's wonderful, sir.
I do like a man who says right off he's looking out for himself.
Don't we all?
Let's talk about the black bird, huh?
Mr. Spade, have you any idea how much that little black bird is worth?
I know it's valuable,
- but I don't know what it is.
- You don't know what it is?
What do you know, sir, of the ancient Order of St. John of Jerusalem,
- afterwards called the Knights of Rhodes?
- They were crusaders or something.
in acknowledgment that Malta was still under Spain.
- You understand?
Have you any idea, sir, of the immense, the immeasurable wealth of the Order of St. John?
As far as I can remember, they were pretty well-fixed.
"They were pretty well-fixed. "
For years, they had taken the cream of the East as spoils of victory.
We all know that to them the Holy Wars were merely a matter of loot.
Holy Wars?
I'll bet that was a great racket.
The knights wanted to express their gratitude to the Emperor.
So the bird they sent him for the first year's tribute wasn't an insignificant live bird, but a glorious, golden falcon encrusted with the finest jewels in their coffers.
The finest, largest jewels out of Asia.
- Those are historical facts, sir.
"All right," you say.
But the falcon never reached the Emperor.
Pirates captured the boat on which it was shipped to Spain and took the bird.
I've traced the history of that bird all over Europe, sir.
In 1840 it turned up in Paris.
By that time, to hide its real identity, it was enameled over to look like nothing more than a fairly interesting statuette.
- And it's still the same way?
- Under that disguise, it was kicked around the gutters of Paris for 70 years.
- In 1911, a Greek found it and discovered its real value.
His home was raided, and he was murdered.
No one else knew what the bird was, and so it was lost again.
- And it's still lost.
- That was 20 years ago, sir.
It took me that time to locate it, but I did it.
I traced it to the home of a Russian in Constantinople.
Kemidov.
He wouldn't sell it.
So I sent some agents to get it for me.
They got it, and I haven't got it.
So it doesn't belong to any of you.
- It belongs to General Kemidov.
- Belongs?
You might as well say it belongs to the King of Spain.
But I don't see how you can say it belongs to anyone, except by right of possession.
- Then it belongs to Miss Wonderly now.
- No, sir,
- except as my agent.
- You're sure she has it?
Yeah, but you know where to get it.
At the right time and for the right price.
Well, now, before we begin talking price, how soon can you deliver the falcon?
- A couple of days.
- That's satisfactory.
Now, I have two proposals to make, sir.
I will pay you $25,000 when you deliver the falcon to me, and another $25,000 when I get to New York.
- That's one.
I will give you 25°/0, one-quarter of what I realize on the falcon.
Now, take your choice.
Either an immediate $50,000, or a much greater sum within, say, a couple of months.
- How much greater?
If I were to tell you the probable minimum, you'd call me a liar.
Not even if I thought so.
Well, what do you say, sir, to a half a million as your share?
And you really believe this bird is worth $2 million?
Now, Mr. Gutman, what about a deposit to cinch this deal?
Why, what was I thinking?
How about $1,000?
Now I have your word that you won't back out.
My word!
You've got my $1,000 dollars, besides.
The doctor is here.
Excuse me, sir, I have a medical appointment.
Joel, my boy.
Does this mean that you've come back to the fold?
I just offered him $25,000 for the falcon.
And I offered him $5,000.
We were both of us fools.
- He hasn't got it.
- He hasn't got it?
Why, I just gave him a thousand bucks to bind the deal.
He says he can get it within two days.
- We can get it without him today.
- You remember Jacobi? Captain Jacobi?
- Jacobi?
I mentioned him in my report from Hong Kong.
I wrote you I'd seen the Wonderly girl there with him.
- His boat was La Paloma.
Well, what's all this got to do with it?
Oh, you don't connect it with the falcon in any way, huh?
- Miss Wonderly has the falcon. - No, she hasn't.
I've searched her apartment.
The falcon is not there.
Because she gave it to Jacobi in Hong Kong.
Gave it to him?
To bring back to America, while she and Thursby took another boat.
What time does the Paloma dock?
I phoned the harbor.
She's expected in before midnight.
- We better hurry.
- Well, he still has got my money.
Wilmer can take care of him.
I know a better way.
My technique is not so abrupt as Wilmer's.
My apologies for the interruption, Mr. Spade.
Had we finished our little deal, or hadn't we?
- We certainly had.
- I am delighted to hear you say that, sir.
We shall drink to an affiliation which will prove, I am sure, a pleasure and a benefit to us both.
Well, here's to clear understanding.
All successful business deals are floated on the wave of good fellowship.
- Do you agree with me, Mr. Spade?
I thought you would, Mr. Spade.
Hey, what are you doing here this hour of the night?
Well, you told me to stick around till you came back.
- Wait a minute.
- He's dead, honey.
- Oh, but, Sam,
- don't you think we ought to get a doctor?
- Well, a doctor won't do any good.
Quick, lock that door.
"John Jacobi.
"Captain of the La Paloma.
Arrived San Francisco from Hong Kong. "
Let's have a look at the bag.
Ruth Wonderly.
Unlatch that, honey.
Sam, what is that?
Honey, it's the black bird they're all after.
I don't know why it's so valuable, but it's worth a fortune.
Sam, whoever shot that captain will do the same to you.
Oh, stop worrying, honey.
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Now, don't ask questions.
- Check this.
- Writing love letters, Sam?
- Don't go too far with that.
It's one of the best ways of getting in trouble.
Are you telling me?
I'm looking for you all night to tell you something.
From Dundy?
No, the District Attorney this time.
What's he want to see me for?
It's Iva Archer, Sam.
She's been dishing plenty of dirt.
Spade, who killed Miles Archer?
You certainly could make an excellent guess.
My guesses might be excellent, but I'm not silly enough to make them in front of a District Attorney.
I don't think I'm convinced yet that the police have the right theory.
Well, I'm glad of that.
They've narrowed the solution down to just two things.
Number one,
Archer was killed by a woman who wanted him out of the way.
Number two, the wife's paramour committed the crime with the object of removing Archer as an obstacle to their illicit relations.
And number three,
Archer died of old age.
Spade, you're concealing information that will enable us to solve this.
And by withholding that information, you make yourself an accomplice to a murder.
I thought this was gonna be an informal talk.
I am a sworn officer of the law 24 hours a day, and neither formality or informality justifies you in withholding from me evidence of a crime.
Unless, of course, you're afraid of incriminating yourself.
I've got nothing to tell you or the police.
Now, if you have anything more to say to me, why, have me pinched, and I'll come down here with my lawyer.
I've been thinking of doing that.
Well, when you make up your mind, let me know.
And when I do, Spade, you'll know that we have information about you and Miles Archer's wife that will require a lot of explanation.
Well, the only chance I see of saving myself would be to bring in the murderers all tied up in a nice little bouquet.
I'll give you just 24 hours to do that.
I'll make a note of it on my cuff.
And remember this, Spade, if you don't come through by this time tomorrow, I'll order you arrested for the murder of Miles Archer.
You can always get me at my office or my home, Mr. Bryant.
I aim to give service at all times, night and day.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Sam, I didn't think you'd ever get here.
I've been waiting hours for you.
I think there's someone following me.
Take me upstairs, quick.
Oh, so we have company, huh?
Well, sir, we're all here.
Shall we sit down and be comfortable while we discuss the matter?
We know, of course, that you have the falcon.
Well, when can you make the first payment?
You know we were talking of more money than this.
We were, sir, but we were just talking.
This is actual coin.
Permit me to remind you, Mr. Spade, you may have the falcon, but we most certainly have you.
I'm not gonna let that worry me.
Now listen to me carefully, every one of you.
There's an angle to this deal you've all overlooked.
- And what is that, sir?
- We've got to have a fall guy.
- A fall guy?
We've got to feed the police a victim. Somebody they can stick for those three murders.
You can't expect us to believe that you're afraid of the police and not able to handle them.
I'm not afraid of the police, and I can handle them.
But you've gotta toss them somebody to hang the works on.
You can't be serious, sir.
A fall guy, as you call it, would only lead them to the falcon.
No, we leave well enough alone.
Well, get this through your brain, Gutman.
The police are not asleep, they're laying low and waiting.
And I'm in this mess up to my neck, and they know it.
You're not a man that worries about a little trouble, sir.
You'll manage that.
While you skip to New York or China or someplace, huh?
Well, I'm in business here, remember that.
This is my town and my racket, and I know what's best for us.
Gutman, we're sunk, unless we hand over a fall guy.
Well, none of us exactly qualifies for the part, sir.
My dear sir, it's too ridiculous.
Why, I feel toward Wilmer exactly as if he were my own son.
Well, you can easily pick another son, but there's only one black bird.
- Remember that.
- Lf your scheme were practical, which it isn't, what would prevent Wilmer from telling the police about the falcon and all of us?
Oh, we can have him shot for resisting arrest.
My fondness for Wilmer renders it impossible.
Well, I have another suggestion to make.
Why don't you give them Cairo?
Why not you or Miss Wonderly?
All I insist on is a fall guy.
You seem to forget that you are not in a position to insist on anything.
I am in a swell position, and don't you forget it.
Let's settle this.
You've received your money, why can't we have the falcon now?
I said I want 20,000 bucks, and besides, I couldn't get the bird before daylight.
Daylight?
Well, in that case, perhaps it will be best for us all if we don't get out of each other's sight until our business has been transacted.
Wilmer, lock that door.
See that nobody leaves or enters.
You have the envelope?
Honey, it's a long wait before daylight.
You better go and fix some eggs, some sandwiches and some coffee.
We must entertain our guests.
You will all excuse me, won't you?
Now just a moment, my dear.
Better leave the envelope.
You don't want to get any grease spots on it.
Oh, how stupid of me.
There are only nine bills here now, but when I gave them to you, there were 10.
Say, you had the money last, now one of the bills is missing.
- I didn't take it, Sam.
- Maybe you didn't, but I have to find out.
- You won't take my word for it?
No, I won't take your word for it.
- Oh, yes, you will.
- Well, I certainly won't.
I'll have them take them off for you.
- You palmed it, Gutman.
I said you palmed it.
Now, if you don't admit it, I'm gonna frisk you.
I was curious to know what you would do.
That's a trick I'd expect from somebody the skunk's age.
So you're trying to frame Miss Wonderly, huh?
Frame her?
You were going to let her be the fall guy.
Well, I'm gonna decide right now who it's going to be.
It's gonna be Wilmer.
What do you think of the idea, Wilmer?
Funny, hey?
- I'll give him something to laugh at.
- Now, now, Wilmer.
You shouldn't attach so much importance to these things.
The gentleman is only joking.
Well, make him lay off me, or I'll fog him.
- And nothing'll stop me.
- Now, now, Wilmer.
Now, now, sit down.
I'll lay you two to one, they're selling you out, kid.
Spade...
Well, here's our fall guy.
- There's no but about it.
You say yes right now, or I'll turn the black bird and the whole gang of you in.
Well, you can have him, sir.
What about you, Cairo?
Are you with us or against us?
- That's swell.
Now we're getting someplace.
Berkeley 007.
Poor Wilmer.
- Hello, honey.
I'm sorry to get you out of bed.
Listen, dear, you know our general delivery box at the post office?
There's an envelope in my handwriting.
There's a baggage checker for that suitcase we got last night.
I want you to bring it over to my apartment early this morning.
- Atta girl.
- I'll take the envelope now.
- With the greatest of pleasure, sir.
- All right, Gutman.
Now, let's get the details fixed.
Just why did Wilmer kill Thursby, and how did he kill Captain Jacobi?
Thursby was a notorious killer, sir, and Miss Wonderly's protector.
We tried to persuade him to join us, but we couldn't.
So Wilmer followed him to his hotel and did what he did.
If Wilmer killed both of them with the same gun then the bullets will match.
Captain Jacobi's death was entirely Miss Wonderly's fault.
Just how do you mean that?
He would never have been killed if she hadn't entrusted the falcon to him in Hong Kong.
Then he was in on the deal with all of you?
He knew nothing about it.
But after he came under the influence of Miss Wonderly's charm, he agreed to bring the falcon to America
- while she came on a fast boat.
- With Thursby?
The falcon went from Thursby to Jacobi, and from Jacobi, at her instructions, to you.
Then I was next in line after Captain Jacobi.
Miss Wonderly's admirers have been many, sir, and she has used them all to her great advantage.
Say, what's the matter with you?
Just a fly.
- No, I'll see you later at the office.
- All right, goodbye.
Well, here's your black bird.
It's the falcon, all right.
But we make sure.
Get a knife.
This is a fake.
This is not the real falcon.
Well, that's the only one I know about.
You've had your little joke, why don't you tell them where the real one is?
Oh, no, Sam.
I swear this is the one I got from Kemidov.
It was the Russian.
You have bungled the whole thing, you fathead!
You let him know it was valuable, and he made a duplicate.
And what fools he's made of us.
Chasing each other around the world for a lump of lead.
Yes, it's the Russian.
There's no doubt of that.
Well, I have to admit the fault is mine.
Well, shall we stand here and call each other names, or shall we go back to Constantinople and Kemidov?
- You're going to try for it again?
- Certainly. Why not?
I am with you.
Wilmer, you'll go, of course.
- Your little boyfriend checked out.
Oh, well. That's too bad.
Yeah, his services would have been invaluable.
And I loved him like a son.
I'll trouble you for that envelope, sir.
Don't be silly, Gutman.
It's your hard luck, not mine.
My $10,000, please.
I deeply regret that you are left without a fall guy.
I'll do all right.
Union 2000.
- Hello, Tom.
- Sam Spade.
Listen, move up fast on three crooks leaving town.
Gutman, Palace Hotel, Room 900.
And Cairo.
Yes, you met the guy over here.
And a kid named Wilmer Cook.
Cook shot Thursby and Jacobi.
I've got the gun the kid used.
I've got it right here in my place.
And you better step on it.
Listen, honey, let me get this straight with you.
You and Cairo double-crossed Gutman, and then you ditched Cairo in favor of Thursby.
Just why did you give the black bird to Jacobi?
I was afraid that Thursby couldn't be trusted.
- That Gutman might buy him over.
- That's a lie.
You had him hooked, and you knew it.
What was your scheme for disposing of Thursby?
I thought if he saw that Archer was following him, it might frighten him into leaving town.
I didn't think he'd really shoot Archer.
Well, if you thought that you were right, Thursby never killed Archer.
But he'd have gone up that alley with you, honey.
Sam, don't talk to me like that.
And if you had asked him to go up that alley with you, and he knew no one else were there, he would've gone.
How did you know he grinned?
I know Archer, and I want to know why you killed him.
Well, you did kill him, didn't you?
I didn't mean to at first.
I meant what I said when I told you that I just wanted Thursby frightened.
- But when I found out I couldn't, I...
- Oh, stop lying.
I'll tell you why you shot him.
You figured that Thursby would be nailed for the killing, and then you could get the black bird for yourself.
But when you found out Thursby was shot, you needed a protector, and so you came back to me, right?
I would have come back to you sooner or later.
You know, from the first time I saw you, I knew that sometime I'd come back to you.
You angel.
Well, with a lucky break you ought to be out of San Quentin in 20 years, and then you can come back to me.
I hope they don't hang you, honey.
You know, it'd be a shame to stretch that pretty little neck of yours.
Sam, don't say such things.
Not even in fun.
You can't! Not after what we've been to each other.
Don't be silly, sister.
You're gonna take the fall.
You mean you're really gonna send me over?
I don't mean anything else but.
Then you've been pretending.
You don't care.
- Oh, I think I do.
I'm not Thursby or Jacobi, and I won't play the sap for you.
You know down in your heart that in spite of everything I've done
You haven't been on the level with me for a half-hour at a stretch.
Why, you double-crossed every man
- that was fool enough to fall for you.
- Not you, Sam.
Oh, it...
It's easy enough to be nuts about you, too.
That'll all pass.
Oh, I'll have some rotten nights. They won't mean anything.
I'll get over you in time.
Oh, hello, boys.
Hello, Spade.
There you are, Tom.
These are the guns the kid used to kill Thursby and Jacobi.
Yeah, well, he used another one since.
The hotel says Gutman is dead.
Shot to death by Wilmer Cook.
- The kid got him, eh?
- Yeah, him and Cairo.
We grabbed the kid just as he was leaving the hotel.
- Well, I guess that settles everything.
There's another murder to clear up before noon.
- Got it all figured out how I did it?
- I've done a lot of figuring.
Gentlemen, you know Miss Wonderly.
- Yeah, how do?
She killed Archer with Thursby's gun.
She's an accomplice of Cairo and the kid.
Have you got enough on her to make a pinch?
Don't worry, Dundy.
I've got enough evidence to cinch everything that I say.
Come on, sister, let's be going.
What a pity the detective agencies haven't more men with your strength of character, Mr. Spade.
Don't worry about me, Miss Wonderly.
There's nothing funny about this.
- When will we see you?
- I'll be down later.
- She's in number 10, sir.
Say, kid. Got a cigarette?
Hi, boy.
Cigarette, honey?
How's the food?
Rotten?
You just couldn't keep away from me, could you?
Well, not when I've got good news for you.
They just made me Chief Investigator for the District Attorney's office.
Well, they couldn't find a better man for the job.
I thought you'd like to know.
You helped me get it.
I assure you it was a labor of love.
Love?
Just that, Sam.
Well, if there's any little thing you need, why, let me know.
I want you to be very nice to that girl in number 10.
Give her anything she wants.
Cigarettes and candy.
- Very well, Sam.
Just as you say.
But who will I charge it to?
Send the bill to the District Attorney's office.
I'll okay it.
But would that be all right?
Yes, sir.
Well, well, well!
Jimmie Powers.
You old son of a gun.
I'm afraid there must be some mistake.
You trying to kid me,Jimmie?
What do you know?
He's trying to kid me.
L-Let me get this straight.
You mean to tell me you're notJimmie Powers?
I'm afraid that's exactly what I mean to tell you.
Well, I've heard everything.
Say, if you aren'tJimmie Powers, I'll- - I'll eat your hat.
Well, in that event, I suppose I really owe it to you to make assurance doubly sure.
Oh, as I thought.
I am not Mr.Jimmie, uh, uh-- what was it, uh-
- Powers at all.
Well, I'll be whatever it is.
Of course, now, I might be mistaken.
Perhaps I should take up the habit of carrying my birth certificate around with me.
Come on,Joe. I told you not to take that last double Bronx.
If you gentlemen will excuse me.
Please convey my compliments, to Mr., uh, uh, uh, what's-his-name, and tell him that I don't really resemble him on purpose.
Oh, come on,Joe.
I never heard of anything like it before.
And he says he ain't.
You could be mistaken, couldn't ya?
No, I couldn't.
Why, he was the managing editor of that newspaper back in Springfield.
I used to-- Six years ago.
I used to run into him every day.
And then he got into some kind of a jam and-- just disappeared.
What kind of a jam?
Maybe he was trying to high-hat you just now.
It's no skin off your back, is it? Uh, Mr. Taylor, please.
Why, he was the most promising newspaperman in the country.
Michael Trevor calling.
Mr. Taylor said you were to come right up.
Room 309, sir.
Thank you.
Glad to see you. How are you, Mr. Taylor?
Come on in. Sit down.
Thank you.
Well, it's nice to see you again.
I tried to call you up myself, but I didn't know where to get hold of you.
I guess I was a little tight that day I met you at the Ritz.
Oh. I kind of forgot to get your phone number.
Well, I got yours.
So, here we are.
Oh, thank you, no.
- I had a purpose in phoning you this morning, Mr. Taylor.
Aside from my desire to see you again, of course.
Glad you did.
I'll try to be as brief as possible.
I don't know if you know very much about me.
Oh, sure, I do.
You're just being modest.
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Trevor.
They tell me you're over here writing a great novel.
Ah. I wish I could be as sure of that as they are.
Well, all I know is that some four years ago I quit being a newspaperman in America.
Now I'm over here to see if I can really write.
You've been in Paris four years?
Mmm. I wish I could stay over here four years.
Hmm. I've only been here a week.
For the most part, we have a very nice crowd of Americans living here in Paris permanently.
Paris is certainly a liberal education.
I thought I'd seen a lot, but let me tell you.
These Frenchmen--
Uh, French.
And how!
Unfortunately, there are a few Americans living in this town who are not exactly all they might be.
Frankly, there's only a handful, but they're what I've come to see you about.
There was a little redhead at the Folies-Bergere the other night.
And let me tell you-- Ah, yes.
I know. I know.
Now, uh, these fellows I'm talking about, Mr. Taylor, live by their wits-- and by other people's lack of them.
I ran into one of them last night.
He helps get out a weekly paper here, printed in English.
No good here.
Me, I didn't come to Paris to read.
Uh, this paper isn't circulated much in Paris.
It's meant chiefly for American consumption.
This fellow was drunk, and he talked too much.
Among other things, he showed me a copy of an item they're going to run in their next week's issue.
I... put it in my pocket when he wasn't looking.
Just leave it here, and I'll read it.
Well, I think you had better read it right away.
It's, uh- - It's about you.
About me?
Well, what's it say?
Well--
Shall I read it to you?
It says,
'"Tis a pity that some of our compatriots are so naive and lacking in worldly knowledge.
"With whom he seemed to be on such intimate terms at Zelli's the other morning at 4:00.
"Those in the know were forced to smile broadly... "as this strangely assorted couple left the restaurant... "arm in arm.
Watch your step, Harry boy."
We, uh, got so well acquainted that day at the Ritz, Mr. Taylor, that I thought I'd take the liberty of bringing this item to you.
You could do those of us living here a great service.
We know who gets out this sheet.
And what we would like you to do... is to take this item to the police and get the whole gang arrested. Arrested?
Exactly.
You could put him where he belongs:
behind the bars.
Say.Just a minute.
If I- - If I go to the police, it'll get in the papers, won't it?
Well, that's something I don't want any part of.
Ah, but, Mr. Taylor-- I can't afford to have this item get back to America.
And I- - I can't afford to let it be known that I had it stopped.
It's always the same old thing.
Every time we get something on this fellow that could send him to jail, the victim is unwilling to prosecute.
I'd like to help you out, but-- but I can't.
Well, I'm sorry I wasted your time, Mr. Taylor.
I'll say good day.
Oh. Oh,just a minute. Uh, wait a minute.
How would I go about getting this fella not to print this little item?
I don't suppose it would be very difficult.
You think not?
It would be worth something to me not to have it appear.
Say, I wonder if you'd do me a favor?
How about, uh, you seeing this fellow for me?
My seeing him?
He'd probably listen to you, where he wouldn't to me.
Chances are he'd try to hold me up for more.
Of course, uh, I'd be prepared to pay something for it.
Pay him, of course. Oh. Oh.
I didn't mean, uh--
Say, you'd be doing me an awful service if you'd help me out on this.
Well, I'll certainly be glad to do anything I can. Ah.
Suppose a couple of thousand? Uh--
Wait a minute. Comment?
Don't pull up your flag.
Why do I always have to get chauffeurs who don't speak English?
Now maybe he'll get the idea I want him to wait.
Don't you want to come in a minute, Frank?
There what goes again?
Oh, Mary.
I know you have to go, Frank, but it's that kind of thing that keeps me from making up my mind.
I don't want to-- to get engaged to a man who thinks of nothing but business all the time.
Oh, Mary, if you'd only say you'll marry me, I'd cut out business-- if you wanted me to.
That's just it.
I don't want you to stop doing the things you want to do, just on account of me.
I was only fooling, Frank.
I'm not really mad.
I wish you'd blow a whistle from now on when you're fooling.
I never can tell.
I never want you to be able to tell.
We seem to be causing a traffic jam.
They can work up a tra-- traffic jam in this town with just one car.
7:00.
Don't forget. I won't.
And whatever the French is for "Try and get me there alive." I can't tell you how much obliged I am to you, Mr. Trevor.
I'll see that he gets this.
I think I can guarantee you this is the last you'll hear of the matter.
From what they say of this fellow, he seems to be living from hand to mouth, so I'm sure your donation will be more than enough to shut him up.
Of course, I would have rather had you bring charges against him.
Oh, no, no. No, no. That's out of the question.
Well, I suppose so.
I wish you'd have dinner with me some night before I go.
Oh, thank you. I don't get out very much, but if I do get the chance--
Uh-- Oh. Excuse me.
That's all right, Mary.
A real good friend of mind.
Mr. Trevor. Mr. Trevor, this is my niece Mary. Mary Kendall.
How do you do, Mr. Trevor?
Been shopping?
Uh, where's Frank?
Mean to tell me he's left you alone for five minutes?
Received a wire to come to London tonight.
He's going to meet that Dutch inventor tomorrow.
I wish you could meet Frank.
He and Mary are going--
Uncle Harry has the soul of a matchmaker, Mr. Trevor.
Just because Frank and I grew up together and are fond of each other--
Well, in my time, you didn't need much more than to grow up together and be fond of each other.
Wait till you meet him, Mr. Trevor.
He's got the stuff, that kid.
He's going to be one of the richest men in the state before he's through.
I'm sure Mr. Trevor isn't interested-- You're right. I-
- I guess I do talk a little too much.
I'm afraid I'll have to be running along now.
I wish you'd wait and have a drink.
Some other time perhaps.
Say, wait. Uh--
I'll bet you know all the places in Paris.
Where's a good place to have dinner?
Oh, Uncle Harry.
Oh, it's a pleasure, Miss Kendall.
There's Ciro's of course, but all Americans go there.
We did.
Uh, have you tried, uh, the Paradis d'Azur?
Paradis d'Azur? "Blue Heaven"?
Good orchestra?
We'll try it tonight.
Good-bye, Miss Kendall.
Good-bye, Mr. Trevor.
Good-bye, Mr. Taylor.
And thanks a thousand.
Uh, two thousand.
That's one swell guy, that fellow.
Is he?
I'll say so.
He did me a big favor.
I'd certainly like to do something for him sometime.
Some business deal?
He's a writer living in Paris.
I'd like to live in Paris.
Of course, a fellow would have to watch his step, but... I'll bet it'd be a lot of fun once you got to know the place.
How do you like my new hat?
Oh, it's a humdinger.
Why don't you come along to dinner with me and Frank tonight?
No, no. I have a business meeting.
I hope this business meeting breaks up before daylight.
Do you know what time the elevator man told me you got in last night?
There's a fortune waiting for any elevator man who can't tell time.
Bonsoir, Marie.
Bonsoir, Monsieur Trevor.
How is every little thing, big boy?
Hotsy-totsy?
You're getting on, Marie.
Good evening, Louis.
Good evening, Monsieur Trevor.
Only table four and 1 7, Monsieur Trevor.
The lady at table four is a Mrs.Jowitt, from St. Louis.
Well, here's to you.
Why, that's the Mrs.Jowitt who got here last month, isn't it?
She's just a babe in the woods-- especially for Spade Henderson.
The waiter reports that Mrs.Jowitt... picked up Spade at Henry's Bar an hour ago.
Well, I may make this Mrs.Jowitt the object of my good deed today.
I am at peace with the world, Louis.
Fortune has been kind to me.
Besides, it might be just as well for my friend Henderson... to learn to follow my rule of keeping women off his list of customers.
Excellent rule, Mr. Trevor.
And, uh, number 1 7?
A very, very wealthy Mr. Bradkins from Chicago.
The prettiest hand I ever saw.
The lady with him is not his wife.
Not his wife?
Louis, I'm afraid you're losing your illusions.
The pleasantest of occupations, Monsieur Trevor. Mmm.
This note may be of interest to Spade.
He needn't know who sent it.
Yes, Mr. Trevor.
Thank you, Louis.
No supper, Louis.
Just a small bottle of Perrier.
Yes, Monsieur Trevor.
A friend of Uncle Harry's.
I met him this afternoon.
Another old friend whom your uncle never saw before today.
Oh, you never can tell.
Uncle says he's a very clever novelist.
Who gave you this note?
It was left at the door, monsieur, a moment ago.
Bad news?
- Say, Mrs.Jowitt, I wonder if you'd excuse me?
Uh, an important call.
I've gotta see a fella right away.
Oh, here.
I thought we were going to go places and do things.
Some other time maybe.
Well, if this is Paris, something tells me I'm not going to like it.
Oh, Frank, I wish you weren't going.
I'll only be gone 1 0 days-- or less.
Ten days is pretty long.
I wouldn't be going if I didn't have to see this fellow.
I wish I could have gotten a stateroom.
I get seasick so easy, and the thought of having to sit up for three hours... while I'm being tossed around on that channel doesn't make me any too happy.
Sometimes I think I'd have been better off if I'd spent my summer in Pittsburgh.
There must be some way of getting a stateroom.
The porter at the hotel did everything he could.
He said there wasn't a chance.
Phone the company.
Maybe somebody turned back a reservation.
No. I've changed my mind.
I'd rather swim the Channel than tackle one of these French phones.
But you've got to get a stateroom.
Not if I have to phone, I don't.
Oh, you big baby.
If you won't do something, I will. I know who can do it.
You've got a lot of crust, if you ask me, Mary.
Mr. Trevor, may I present Mr. Reynolds?
How do you do, Mr. Reynolds?
Won't you sit down, Mr. Trevor?
Oh, thank you. I wonder if you'd do us a favor?
Frank has to go to London tonight.
He was going to fly this afternoon, but they called off the service on account of fog.
Now he has a ticket on the boat, but no stateroom. They were all sold out.
You would like me to help you to get a stateroom.
You get the general idea.
Oui, monsieur. Uh, what time does your train leave, Mr. Reynolds?
2:00.
Uh, that's all.
I asked him to wire the purser.
There'll be a stateroom waiting for you in my name.
How about a little wine, Mr. Trevor?
Oh. I think not.
We're awfully obliged to you.
How is Paris treating you?
I'm afraid we don't know the places to go to.
I think this place is lovely, but I would like to see some French people.
This has been a favorite hangout of Americans for years.
The prices are higher here than anywhere else.
Uncle Harry says you know Paris so well, Mr. Trevor.
Where should we go from here?
Well, if you've time, uh, there's a little place I make a habit of dropping into at night... just before going to bed when I'm really hungry.
If you like, uh, why not come there with me?
It's very French.
Say, that's an idea.
But surely we've taken all the advantage of you-- Oh, not at all.
If you're sure we wouldn't be intruding. I'd like to get away from this tourist stuff for awhile.
Well, uh, will you be my guests?
Not to give you a short answer, Mr. Trevor, yes.
Good.
Ready, Frank?
I never know whether I'm getting change or owe the place money.
Merci, monsieur. If you say this is the real stuff, I suppose it is.
But I had Paris figured out all different.
Well, I suppose Paris means something different for everyone.
For you, I imagine it means clothes.
To Mr. Reynolds, uh, an interlude.
Pause between business deals.
To your uncle, I daresay it means, uh, change.
And to you?
There was a time when it meant everything:
gaiety, glamour, adventure.
Now-- And now?
Now it's just a place to live... and eat onion soup at 1 :00 in the morning.
In America at this hour I suppose it would mean chop suey.
Give me chop suey every time.
I don't know but what I agree with you.
You know, years ago I used to be a-- a reporter.
After we put the paper to bed at night, we used to stop in at a little place on the corner for chop suey and, uh--
Foo yong.
I hadn't thought of that for years.
I suppose living in Paris makes up for not having a bowl of chop suey.
It's not the chop suey you miss.
Home.
Fellows I used to know.
Plain things without sauces.
Hello, Mr. Trevor.
Oh, hello, Fred.
Off your beaten path a bit tonight, aren't you?
Yes. I guess I am.
You know, these folks want to see all the sights marked on the picture postcards.
I'm beginning to think they've been getting the wrong kind of postcards.
The best American guide in Paris, that fellow.
He doesn't seem to be any better than you are.
That man back there was Michael Trevor.
Very prominent American writer. Very prominent.
What's he written?
Novels I guess you'd call 'em.
When you get right down to it, what are they?
Nothing but books.
It's five past 1 :00.
I've got to be going.
It's been very nice of you to show us around like this, Mr. Trevor.
Ah. My pleasure.
I'll only be gone 1 0 days.
I'd be tickled to death if you'd be my guest some night when I get back.
You'd better hurry back.
Uncle Harry will go out of his mind if has to spend all his time with me.
Pretty tough. His first week in Paris, and having to take you around wherever he goes.
I can't imagine his ever regarding you as a burden.
Only in Paris, I hope. Oh.
If I can, uh, relieve him of any part of it--
If you could take Mary around a bit, that would be great.
That's fine. Now all we need is Mar-- uh, Miss Kendall's consent.
Mary consents with very unmaidenly rapidity.
I'd like to call you tomorrow, if I may.
There's a special cup race at Longchamps.
Oh, I'd love to go!
Suppose I call for you tomorrow at, uh, 1 :00?
Oh, that'll be fine.
Well, I think I'll walk home.
I wouldn't dare walk five steps from this door. I'd get lost.
There'll be a taxi along, uh, almost any minute, I'm sure.
Thanks a lot for showing us around.
Not at all.
Until tomorrow then?
I like that guy.
He's very nice.
He's--Well, I mean, he's, uh--
He's very charming and sophisticated.
It's a great break for you to get a man like that, that knows all about Paris to ask you to go out with him.
To ask me to go out with him?
Don't be silly. We did everything but lasso him.
If I'd say "Hotel de Régent," where do you think we'd wind up?
Hotel de Régent. 2:00.
He'll probably be along any day now.
No need getting up on your ear about it.
Nothing's happened to him.
I told you. I saw him myself at Papa Jules's less than an hour ago.
Well, I'm not gonna wait around half the night for him.
You've had a lot of practice doing it.
But I quit worrying about him personally six months ago.
Kind of mutual, wasn't it?
Mutual or not, strictly business.
That's little Irenie from now on.
You know, I don't mind your kidding me, but I kind of hate to see you kid somebody else.
Somebody else?
Yourself.
Now, wouldn't you know it?
It's all your life is worth to even turn around in this room.
Say, that guy's got books where I wouldn't put... hairpins.
What does he do with them all?
Read them?
Well, what do you suppose he does?
Practice juggling?
Say, that cuckoo would rather read than eat.
The Money Systems of the Middle Ages.
There's a hot subject for you.
As far as I'm concerned, there's just one little book we need.
Good old Dun Bradstreet:
who's who, and how much has he got?
When you're through with a guy, it's how much did he have, isn't it?
I manage to get along pretty well.
If you only weren't so shy and uncommunicative, Irene.
Fancy seeing you here!
You must have forgotten.
You were supposed to meet us here two hours ago.
Oh, so that was it.
Somehow I, uh, couldn't recall what it was I had forgotten.
I hope your fit of aphasia didn't include Harry Taylor.
My dear Irene, armed with nothing but my trusty fountain pen and galley proofs, I stalked Mr. Taylor to his lair and bagged this.
Too bad you can't have checks stuffed and hung above the fireplace.
Did he make any fuss?
Fuss?
As a matter of fact, I'm a friend of the family now.
Guess where I've been.
At the Ritz bar.
Well, then I can't guess.
Dining with Taylor's niece and her young man.
Oh, that's the people you were with at Papa Jules's.
You mean you met the girl?
Well, we are lucky.
You know, when I was getting the dope on them, I had a feeling we were blowing into the wrong end of the horn.
Now I know it.
Here's a chance to make a real killing.
You just give that dame the works and see how quick her uncle will come across.
I tell you.
It's money from home.
Taking money from women isn't in my line.
It never has been, and you know it.
Oh, it's not as if you'd really hurt anybody.
Gee. The girl doesn't have to know anything about it.
You just put her in a spot where it'll look bad for her if she gets found out, and... her uncle will take care of the rest.
Yes. I know the mechanics of the business.
Well, maybe you don't know this:
I've got to have some money, and I've got to have it quick.
You're a fine, great big protector of womanhood.
Only little Irenie doesn't matter.
I'm not the type to put on a sob act, Michael.
But if I tell you I've got to have it, that there's no other chance of keeping them from sending my brother to the jug back home, you'll believe me.
I've never lied to you yet, Michael.
This is the first time I've ever asked you to break that funny little rule of yours.
Oh, it's been all over between us for a long time, I know, but what do you say?
I need the dough like I never needed it before.
Irene, you know I'd do anything I could for you--
We could all use the dough.
That's the one argument I can never get around.
"We could all use the dough."
But first, last and only.
Anything you want me to do?
No. I can handle this alone.
Say, what's been getting into you lately?
I wish I did.
Well, I'll tell you, if you want to know.
You've been getting ideas.
You've been doing everything but wearing a plume in your hat.
The first thing I know, you'll be helping old ladies across the street.
I used to help a Mrs. Allison across the street on account of her age.
She was old, you see.
You'd better snap out of it.
You've been playing Robin Hood so long, you're beginning to believe in it yourself.
Well, if that's all that's on your mind-- Yes.
If I think of anything else, I'll send word by special messenger.
Maybe we can find someplace where there aren't so many books.
Maybe there'll be a few glasses in sight.
You're going to buy Irenie a little nightcap before you do.
I know better than to argue with you.
I wish I could say as much for everybody in this room.
So long, Mr. Trevor.
French or not French, they look just like any other horses to me. Oh.
You mean to say that you, uh, don't find even a trace of that je ne sais quoi for which France is so famous?
Not a jenny.
Anyway, I didn't come to Paris to look at horses.
There's plenty of horses back home if I want to look at 'em.
But these are champions, Uncle Harry.
Well, I've seen champions before.
They're no treat to me.
Say, how about going back to the bar and having another one of those funny little green drinks?
Ah, yes. If you wish.
If I had my wish about this party, we'd never have left the bar in the first place.
The idea of spending a lovely afternoon like this looking at horses.
But it keeps you out in the open air, Uncle Harry.
Well, I had all the open air I wanted back home.
Hello, Mr. Trevor.
Fred, you don't mean to tell me you're showing Miss Harper the town?
There was a trainer down here in the paddock she didn't know.
So I said I'd introduce her to him. Ah. I see.
Oh, allow me.
Uh, Miss Kendall, uh, Miss Harper.
Uh, Mr. Taylor, Miss Harper.
Miss Harper has been one of the shining ornaments of our little colony here in Paris for several years.
Oh, excuse me, Fred.
Fred is the best American guide in Paris.
You're just the fellow I want to see.
Let me tell you something, mister.
There's a fortune waiting for any guide who don't know anything about monuments, painting, historical edifices or--
A pen picture of Fred if ever I heard one.
You've been doing pretty well dodging monuments and paintings, Uncle Harry, without a guide.
Well, as I remember the old U.S.A., there's plenty of monuments right there.
You're terrible, Uncle Harry.
Not terrible.Just honest.
Most of the time it's the same thing.
Well, to be perfectly honest, would you think it terrible if I were to suggest a little drink?
My error.
I'll join you folks later.
Uh, don't send out an alarm for me until I've been lost for at least 1 0 days.
Well, so long, Mr. Trevor. I got some customers I gotta take to the Louvre.
I should think you would know those pictures pretty well by now.
Oh, I don't look at 'em, Mr. Trevor.
I just explain 'em. Uh--
I didn't dare suggest it while your uncle was here, but, uh, what about seeing something of the race?
What an old-fashioned idea.
Let's.
See if they're set right.
Oh, yes. Watch that number 1 1.
Beautiful thing, isn't it?
Oh, I hope he wins.
Who won what?
The man with the black and gold cap.
Did you bet anything on him?
Then what are you getting so excited about?
There's thousands of races won every day someplace.
I don't figure it's sensible to get excited about horses unless you win something.
Why don't you give me something so I can win?
Well, what did you do with that money I gave you yesterday?
Putting your heart in your work, aren't you?
Now I guess we can go back to the bar and get one of those funny-colored drinks.
Oh, Mary can stay here with Mr. Trevor for the next race if she wants to.
I'm sure Mr. Trevor would rather remain here, wouldn't he?
If I must answer yes or no, yes.
We'll be back in a couple of minutes.
Oh, Mr. Trevor, I'm afraid I'll have to renege on that opera tonight.
But that Russian's going to conduct.
Oh, I didn't mean I didn't want you to go.
No, I really think you ought to go.
It's just that Miss Harper here was telling me... about a new place in Montmartre that's opening up and I thought--
If Miss Harper knows of a new place in Montmartre that's opening up, I'm sure it's the kind of place that you would like.
If Miss Kendall wouldn't mind going to the opera with me alone,
I should be delighted to-- What do you say, Mary?
I don't want to go to the opera if you don't want to.
Well, I wouldn't like to have it generally known, but the opera I want to go to doesn't exist.
Then it's settled.
Come on, Miss Harper.
I have a feeling we can get that fella to make some of that orange stuff... with some of that iced green stuff, and turn out something really beautiful.
I suppose I ought to feel angry with Uncle Harry, but somehow I don't.
For forcing us to go to the opera alone?
That isn't what I meant.
I mean angry for seeing so little of what Paris really can be.
I adore it so, don't you?
I'm not so sure but what he's seeing more of Paris than people who've lived here all their lives.
Besides, I'm rather indebted to him for--
For the opera.
I should think you'd never want to finish writing your novel if it meant you had to leave Paris.
I've had a guilty feeling these last few days that I've made you neglect your work.
Ah, on the contrary.
As a matter of fact, I've been thinking of changing my story entirely, throwing away everything I've written so far.
Well, I was writing the life of a man whom I thought I knew pretty well.
It was all very definite in my mind.
I didn't know exactly what the end was to be, but... it wasn't very hard to guess.
But now it's all different.
I may keep the same man for my hero, but... I think I'll change the entire course of his life.
You see, it's not entirely up to me.
But if you're writing it--
In everything we do, whether we know it or not, there's always a collaborator.
In this case, my hero has... fallen in love with a girl he's just met.
Funny, I'd have bet a million dollars... that he wasn't the type to fall in love at first sight.
But he has.
It's quite a problem.
He doesn't know whether she cares anything for him.
I'm- - I'm not a novelist, but I know how to solve that.
He ought to ask her.
Perhaps.
But suppose-- Suppose what?
Suppose he's not the man she thinks he is, that he seems to be in the opening chapters.
I may have to end it as I first planned it.
If she's the girl you think you've written about, you won't.
Don't you want to go back to your hotel?
But I suppose we'd better.
I suppose we'd better.
Say, where have you been all this time?
I've been taking a walk.
Seems to me you've been doing a lot of walking these last four or five nights.
There may not be many more nights when we have to get out this beautiful little weekly of mine.
That's never very difficult.
Here, Fred.
Now, be sure you get these corrections right.
Let's print the corrections first next time.
Meaning?
I wasn't born yesterday.
You have a gift for unnecessary remarks.
Never mind my gift.
We'll never mind all your gifts.
To spare you the trouble of asking a lot of questions, I'll try to tell it to you as compactly as I can.
Through with what?
Through with all this.
With that printing press, with everything that's ever been printed on it, with-- with the whole works.
You've fallen for that kid.
I thought you had that afternoon at the races... when I saw you looking at her in that funny way.
But I wasn't sure.
I suppose you think that you're in love.
I believe I am in love.
And I suppose she's in love with you?
I think she is.
Well, then think again.
There's a fair chance that she's fallen for you, but she's not in love with you.
You're different from anything she's ever met before.
But she's not in love with you.
There's not a chance in the world for a girl like that to be in love with you.
I suppose you neglected to tell her who you really are and what you really do.
That's over.
Suppose I were to tell her a few things.
You won't have to.
I decided to let her know exactly what I am.
Well, if it's all the same to you, I've got work to do.
Somebody's gotta get those papers out.
And if you're not gonna do your share, I guess I'll have to.
Giving me the silence cure, huh?
Aw, you'll get this silly kid out of your system.
No, Mary Kendall.
Hello.
Oh, hello.
This is Michael.
I'm so glad you told me.
I might never have known.
Mary, I'd like to see you.
That makes it easier.
I would like to see you.
I'll come to the hotel and pick you up if you want, but... I'd prefer to meet you somewhere else.
Somewhere else it is, milord.
Well, can you be at that statue in the Bois in an hour?
Uh, the statue of Cupid?
You sound like a railroad schedule, but I'll be there.
Before I ask you to listen to me, I must warn you... that I'm going to do a lot of talking about myself.
I could think of nothing I could like better.
No, you're wrong.
You don't know anything about me--
I knew everything about you the moment I saw you.
Do you know what I do for a living?
You used to be a newspaperman, and now you're over here writing for yourself.
I used to be a newspaperman.
Until I made a fool of myself.
And then I came over here because... there was nothing further open to me among decent people, among my own people.
Did your uncle say anything about how we met?
I've met a lot of people that way.
I live by my wits.
By finding out things that people don't want to have known about themselves... and by getting paid to keep quiet.
There was a time when I wouldn't have believed it myself.
But that was back home, before--
Well, the details don't matter.
I was a sap.
And they made me pay for it.
So I made up my mind to make other people pay my way from then on.
Why have you told me this?
Because I felt you ought to know.
Why did you feel I ought to know?
Because--
My telling you has served its purpose.
You know now what kind of man I am.
I know now what kind of man you were.
What you're talking about used to be, didn't it?
It's part of a past... to which I'll never return.
Then what difference does it make?
You know so much more than I do.
You've seen so much more of the world than I have.
And you make such a bad job of trying to fool me, Michael.
I wasn't trying to fool you, Mary. I wish I were.
That isn't what I mean, you silly Michael.
You thought by telling me what you used to be... you could cure me of my love for you.
Mary-- What you're saying isn't important now.
It isn't true anymore.
I'm even almost glad it's happened.
Glad?
I don't think I could've stood it if you hadn't had some kind of flaw, Michael.
It's funny, you're trying to tell me you're not worthy of me, when all the time-- Oh, Mary.
Before you called this morning, I tried to write a letter to Frank.
He's fine, good, everything a man should be.
And I don't love him.
Mary, do you mean that in spite of every--
I do mean.
The past is what it was for both of us.
Don't you see that's all that matters? Perhaps we can find a bench where-- Where we can talk?
Where we can talk.
And it was all fixed up for Michael to walk in and ask this guy... what he thought he was doing with his wife.
Good for 5,000 bucks this guy was too.
Mike is supposed to walk in at 4:00.
And sharp 7:00, he shows up.
You can't imagine what I went through those three hours.
Yes, I can.
Hurrah, a caller.
Hmm, it talks.
Say, not wanting to change the subject, but you were supposed to be here at 4:00.
I have something to say to you, Irene.
Well, what am I supposed to do, handsprings?
I think I'll blow along.
Don't bother, Fred.
Anything the district attorney has got to say to me, he can say in front of you.
Oh, uh, excuse me for using the word "district attorney."
I forgot you're very sensitive.
You don't seem to hold your audiences somehow, Michael.
And when you've finished, I want to talk to you seriously.
You know what I told you last night?
You say so many things I can't remember them all.
You put a sort of riddle to me... and answered it yourself.
You were a bit wrong in your answer.
Miss Kendall and I are going to be married.
On the level?
On the level.
And that goes in every way.
And that's what I came to tell you.
Now I'll tell you something.
You're not going to marry that girl, now or ever.
Interesting, but untrue.
I've told her all about myself.
You see, interesting and true.
Don't bother inviting me to the wedding, Michael, because I'll be there anyway.
I'll bring a couple of cops along for protection... and to pull you in as soon as the ceremony is performed.
There are a lot of things the cops in this town would like to know, and I'm just the little lady that can tell them.
I don't suppose you stopped to think of that.
I have a notion you won't do that.
You've been getting a lot of funny notions lately.
And they're not healthy for you.
You are what you are and you're never going to be able to change, because there are a lot of people you've done things to who won't let you.
No matter if you stayed honest from now on until you died.
I'm just like you are, only I ain't kidding myself.
I don't intend to go on as I have.
But you've got to, whether you want to or not.
Let's say you're really in love with this girl.
What kind of love do you think it is?
Because you love her, are you gonna take her no matter what happens to her?
I know, you love each other.
That's all that matters, isn't it?
She can spend five years, 1 0 years of her life as Mrs. Convict Trevor, or whatever one of your aliases they get you under.
If I don't squeal, it doesn't have to be me, something will pop up one of these days and get you... and you know it.
I don't know it.
You're too smart not to have figured it all out for yourself.
Why don't you take a little trip?
She'll forget all about you in a month.
Not that girl.
Then what difference does it make?
And you're never going to be able to change.
Don't you see that's all that matters?
Ten years ofher life as Mrs. Convict Trevor, and you know it.
Never been in love in my life until then.
What kind oflove do you think it is?
Because you love her, are you gonna take her no matter what happens to her? I don't believe it.
Frankly, I don't care whether you believe it or not.
My only interest is in the amount of the check you're going to give me.
That's the fourth time you've said that.
Say it again, and I walk out.
That first gag about holding me up on that item about me and that blonde.
All right, I'll believe that.
But you and Mary--
It's down there in black and white just like that other item.
You can suit yourself about believing it, but that's the way it gets printed unless--
I ought to break every bone in your body.
Well, in the first place, I don't think you can.
And in the second place, the item gets printed whether you do or not.
I've heard about your kind of scoundrel, but I really didn't believe he existed.
Now you know.
This rat is trying to--
That kind of talk will do you no good, except to raise the price.
He wants $1 0,000 to keep that out of a dirty scandal sheet he runs.
It's some kind of joke.
You'll find out how much of a joke it is.
According to this piece, yesterday you and I visited a cheap and notorious inn near Versailles.
You know that this whole thing is a lie.
You know that yesterday, we spent the morning... and most of the afternoon in the Bois.
The item speaks for itself.
If the paper is wrong, I'm sure it will publish a retraction.
Unfortunately, however, a retraction is seldom read... by all the people who read the original statement.
This whole thing is a lie, and you propose to publish it, is that right?
There's one way of stopping publication.
May I speak to-- to Mr. Trevor alone?
I prefer Mr. Taylor to remain in the room.
You are serious about this?
Decidedly.
If Mr. Taylor doesn't listen to reason, that item will be printed in the paper next week.
I, uh, imagine Frank will be interested in reading it.
I think that Frank's interests need concern you no longer.
I don't see what we can do, Mary, except pay him.
And the sooner you take care of it, the sooner I can be on my way.
The sooner you get out ofhere, the better it suits me.
Why did you tell me about yourself if you didn't mean what you said?
If you weren't really--
You are a silly little girl, aren't you?
Suppose someone had seen you with me before I had everything ready.
They might have found out who I was and have told you.
So I told you myself.
I congratulate you.
After all, he has me to thank for it.
It'll be all right, Mary.
You'll forget all about it as soon as Frank gets back.
Monsieur Trevor. Monsieur Trevor.
Inspector Lyons from the prefecture of police. I will be brief.
However, the French government has no desire... to fill its jails with such undesirable foreigners.
You would be conferring a favor upon this man... by letting him know that the police will call upon him tomorrow at this time.
They would be pleased if they were unable to arrest him... because by that hour, he had left the frontiers of France behind him for all time.
If they do arrest him, it will go very hard with him.
Do you understand, Mr. Trevor?
Yes, thoroughly.
That will be all then until 4:00 tomorrow.
Long trip?
Any place in particular?
I was thinking of Cape Town.
Africa, hmm?
They say it's very nice there.
I suppose you know that I tipped off the little lads of the law.
I've been keeping tabs on you.
You went to see her and her uncle at their hotel today.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
Thinking of you and her.
You were right about her. I, uh-
- I convinced her you were right.
It wasn't very difficult.
I just made a couple of things clear to her.
You're a great guy, Michael Trevor.
I suppose I'm the only one in the whole world who thinks so.
But the world's been wrong before.
I wasn't going to let you go through with holding them up, after I found out how much you cared for her.
I sold those platinum bracelets of mine yesterday and wired the money to my brother.
You're something of a swell guy yourself, Irene.
I've never been to South Africa.
Well, I'm taking so much excess baggage, I... suppose I might as well take you too.
What are you thinking about, honey?
All my life, I've dreamed of Paris.
And now all I can think of is that it's four days before we get back to Pittsburgh.
The head man on the ship says we reach Cape Town in about 10 days.
I thought I could never get along without Paris.
Now I'm happier with every mile we get farther away from it.
- Hey, Marius.
- Yes, Fanny?
Liar.
- You think I never do?
- Only when you see me.
Buy me a coffee.
All right. Father's asleep.
Tell me... why weren't you at the dance last night?
There's a dance every Sunday at the Cascade.
- Do you go?
- You meet nice people.
André, Monsieur Bouzique, Victor.
I danced with Victor all evening.
Does he dance as stupidly as he walks?
You're awful.
- I could teach you.
I'd rather not.
I went for a walk, to breathe the night air on the jetty.
- Yes, but I ran into Monsieur Brun.
- Yesterday.
Why did he go?
To take a course.
He went to Paris a clerk and came back an inspector.
- Inspectors earn a lot of money.
- Monsieur Brun? They need to, with all those starched collars they wear.
That's the Saigon.
- And the Yara's whistle.
What's that?
- That whistle.
- It's the Yara.
It's the percolator.
You bought her a coffee?
Want a cup?
Why?
There'll be nothing left for our customers.
You begrudge me a cup of coffee?
- It's the principle of the thing.
- What principle?
Drinking the profits.
You make me look so small.
Make you look small? How?
What do you take me for?
A son who must obey his father.
I was 32 when I felt my father's boot for the last time.
We knew what love and respect were in those days.
- And a kick in the pants.
- We didn't answer back.
I can't imagine Mother hitting me.
You'd snivel in a corner.
It's a pity your father isn't here to whip you into shape.
All our children do is poison our lives.
Poison your life?
I share the work.
Some sharing.
Never here when you're wanted.
- I'm here all day.
- He's right.
What business is it of yours?
You work the whole time with such a sad, sorry expression.
Anyone would think you were a teetotaler.
Maybe I'm neurasthenic.
- Is that catching?
- It just happens.
Don't try to make fun of your father.
And you go and sell your shellfish. Leave us alone.
You're a slacker.
Just like your Uncle Emil.
Just dragging his own shadow along wore him out.
You moon about, don't know your job.
You don't even know your own job.
You can't make a vermouth and black currant.
And as for a Picon-Curaçao, forget it.
Yesterday old Cougard came to complain.
And yet it's easy.
You put one third Curaçao.
A very small third, mind you.
A third of lemon.
A good third of Picon.
And then a large third of water.
That's four thirds.
A glass only holds three thirds.
That depends on the size of the thirds.
- No, it doesn't.
It's arithmetic.
Well, don't try to change the subject.
And the drip on the bottle. Is that arithmetic too? What drip?
The drip you always leave on the bottle.
It's not difficult.
You have to pour it like this.
Twist the bottle and put the drip back with the cork.
But Master Marius doesn't care, so it trickles onto the label.
That's why the bottles are easier to pick up than put down.
- Funny, is it?
- You're laughing too.
If I didn't, I'd cry.
Tomorrow at 9:00 all hands on deck.
Drumroll!
Leading Seaman Piquoiseau, I declare you Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.
Drumroll!
Have you gone crazy?
There's a spy on board.
Admiral Escartefigue, you're reduced to the ranks.
Put him in irons till we reach Manila.
Admiral Escartefigue is reduced to the ranks.
- Isn't it time we left, Captain?
- Are there enough people?
- They're signaling like mad on the quay.
It's probably just some Italians talking.
No, they're gesticulating.
I'll see to it later.
Meanwhile, raise some steam and pull the whistle.
Only three blasts or you'll use up all the steam.
And don't open the throttle too far.
Otherwise it will never shut again.
The ferry isn't popular anymore?
The transporter bridge has taken away my customers.
Now they all use the bridge.
It's modern, and they aren't seasick.
You've had people get seasick on your boat?
- On a 300-foot crossing?
- What 300 feet?
It's 675 feet.
I should know.
I've crossed every day for the last 30 years.
Thirty years.
Monsieur Escartefigue, how do you feel when you see the others?
The boats that go out rather than across the harbor.
Why should I think anything?
They go so far.
Yes, and sometimes so deep.
Last thing at night, when you see all the lights on the water, haven't you ever wanted to turn round and put out to sea?
Out to sea? You're mad, my poor Marius.
- No. I see through you.
- And what do you see?
You hate being stuck here.
- I hate it?
- Yes, own up.
When you drink with the captains back from Brazil or Madagascar, when they tell you about their voyages,
I can see you care.
I'm glad they're home safe and sound.
Marius, I'm proud to be a sailor and a captain, master on board after God.
But Madagascar can go to hell.
I've nothing against patriotism.
I'm glad the French flag flies over those faraway lands, though I can't say it does much for me.
But to go there - especially by boat - no thanks.
I'm quite happy here.
I can't believe my ears.
Well, so long.
He hates to keep passengers waiting.
Such a good lad.
He's using up all my steam. The silly ass!
Full steam ahead.
So, Monsieur Brun, what did you think of Paris?
Sensational.
Did you manage to explore at all?
I took a stroll each evening.
- So you met Landolfi.
He was in the army with me.
Tall and fair.
With a mustache and a constant blink.
You can't miss him.
Then you can't have been in Paris.
But I was.
- And you didn't see Landolfi? - No.
Then he must be dead.
- Paris is very big, you know.
- Sure, it's big.
It's a lot bigger than Marseilles, right?
Forty times as big.
That trip has gone to your head.
They say we Marseillais exaggerate.
But 40 times bigger.
That's a good one.
You're a true Lyonnais.
Oh, my God, it's 12:30.
To change.
Today's Monday.
- What's so special about Mondays?
Every Monday my father has lunch with his girlfriend.
A beautiful buxom Italian.
No, he's changed to a Dutch woman at least twice the size.
When he goes to see her, he makes excuses to hide it.
But it's no crime. He's a widower.
A widower?
Please!
Don't say that word, Monsieur Brun.
- You don't know of my misfortune?
- What misfortune?
Madame Panisse?
Three months tomorrow.
On Friday, she'd eaten a sumptuous dish of snails and fish.
- And that Sunday she passed away.
- Just like that?
Say what you will, the good Lord is not very kind.
Such a devoted wife, and so good at putting the employees to work.
And at home she loved a laugh.
She was always ready for a little joke.
At breakfast, I'd chase her round the table in her shift.
I'd give her little slaps. I'd pinch her nicely... in fun.
In revenge, she'd tickle me.
I'm sure you'd rather not talk about it.
When I think that all that is gone forever.
I weep every night.
I can't go on, Monsieur Brun.
What's to be done?
I've made up my mind.
Come on now.
I have already. I can't endure such suffering any longer.
Don't act hastily.
I've decided to marry again at once.
After all, she's dead.
I can't bring her back.
Some may say I've not waited long enough, but my conscience is clear.
I've wept more in four months than others do in years.
Tears as big as that, Monsieur Brun.
And moans and cries - I don't know how I've borne it.
Yes, I'm to be pitied.
I'll wager you've got someone in mind.
I'm going to propose today.
I can't tell you yet.
But I'll be sending you an invitation to the wedding.
I'm inviting all my clients and friends.
There will be only one person missing.
My poor Felicity.
She always loved a party.
But that's life. It wasn't God's will.
She'll be happier up there looking down on events.
The Malaisie's mate is here.
It's a big order.
I must put my best foot forward.
They asked about sails yesterday.
- A large ship?
- Yes, leaving on an expedition.
On a three-master?
They'll be studying winds and currents in the South Seas.
There's an auxiliary engine.
Panisse, hurry up.
That's enough.
All in good time.
- You want to kill me?
- We must all die one day.
When one isn't rich, one has to work.
He's none too happy.
In Marseilles, nothing comes harder than work.
So, Fanny, is it settled?
I may ask your mother for your hand?
Anyone may ask.
You don't think I'm being foolish?
That's for Mother to decide.
The exquisite modesty of a true maiden.
There you are, sir.
I won't keep you a moment.
Pretend you know nothing.
He thinks no one knows.
Well, I'm going out.
Just for a little walk round the town.
Nothing important.
I really must get rid of this hat.
I may pop into Mostegui's for some fish soup and a steak with fries.
Well, I'm off.
No need to explain yourself.
I'm not explaining myself.
Why should I, at my age?
I'm just informing you that I'm going to Mostegui's.
So that's where we can find you.
No, there's no need for anyone to come to Mostegui's.
If you want something, ask me now.
You said...
I said...
I've nothing to say.
I don't need your permission to go out.
Of course not.
Damn it, what does this inquisition mean?
If I were 86, I'd understand your spying on me.
But I'm not senile.
I won't drown.
Dad, off you go. It's quite natural.
There you are.
My son says it's quite natural.
I shall go - naturally.
People should mind their own business.
It's mere suspicion.
And I won't be suspected by a Lyonnais.
No offense meant.
If Picon comes, take 12 bottles.
That'll be 240 francs.
Twelve bottles.
Don't forget.
No need to tell me.
Leave it to me.
Good God, give me patience.
What did I do to deserve such a son?
He can't be mine. I don't believe it.
If Picon comes, take 12 bottles.
On second thought, don't.
- My poor boy.
You'll be late for your own funeral.
Panisse, have you really thought about this?
Of course I have.
She's 30 years your junior.
Is that my fault?
I'll give her everything she wants - money, jewels...
You're a good man, but I'm afraid she might find something lacking.
I'll say no more.
Don't talk about what you don't know.
- I know love is wonderful.
- Agreed.
- But it's best at 20.
- She is 20.
- But you're 50.
- And I've got lots of money.
My dear Panisse, nightgowns don't have pockets.
I'm only speaking for your own good.
You'd be a good catch, but when I look at you, I see a huge pair of horns.
Just say yes and leave the rest to me.
I'm going to be married.
No one knows yet.
I'm telling you because I need some advice.
- He asked for my hand.
- Perhaps I shouldn't say.
- Don't then.
You'll know soon enough.
Everybody knows that.
He comes every night for your shellfish.
It's a wonder he hasn't died.
- Proving what?
- He's an idiot.
And he won't get the shop till his dad dies.
I don't want the shop, and I don't care a fig for Victor.
What? Old Panisse?
- So you won't advise me?
- Yes, when you find a better story.
The man has bags under his eyes.
Taking a rest, my dear?
Keeping cool.
Yes, "The sun is king today but hide your lovely face lest he should burn in his embrace the pride of Love's nosegay."
- Well said.
- Did you make that up?
I'd say I did, but you'd only see it on the pots of face cream in the window of the corner shop.
But the right poem at the right time lends tone to a conversation.
Marius, two anisettes.
- Is one of those for me?
- Who else? Come and sit down.
I talked to your mother.
She's checking my accounts, but I think she'll agree, if you say yes.
Give me a few days to consider.
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be even more pleased when you say yes.
- How many workers do you have?
Fill up those glasses, my boy.
- They are full.
I'm lying?
- Then let me fill them. - Careful!
You're spilling it.
He's a bit tired today.
That's no way to behave.
Darn.
I forgot my matches.
Wait, Panisse.
How delightful a light is when proffered by a pretty hand.
My hands aren't pretty.
They're so small.
So soft... and warm.
And such a pretty ring.
- Very much.
Is it gold?
I don't know. It was in a cracker.
Then it must be brass.
Do you have a gold ring?
But your necklace is gold?
Yes, my Aunt Zoé gave it to me for my First Communion.
It's very pretty.
What's the medallion on it?
Just a minute. I'll show you.
- What does it say?
Fanny, your mother's calling you.
- I didn't hear anything.
- Well, she is.
She knows where to find you.
Let's talk seriously.
Your mother and I have discussed figures and...
Am I disturbing your chat?
You stopped talking.
We may have private matters to discuss.
Some filth, I reckon.
Filth?
Don't be so rude.
Remember whom you're addressing.
Looking at you makes me feel sick.
Don't look then.
- And don't scowl at me.
- So now I'm scowling at you?
- Have you gone mad?
- Poor lunatic.
Lunatics can be very dangerous.
I know one who'd love to hit you.
Hit me?
My poor boy.
Come out here, if you're a man.
- You're still wet behind the ears.
- Just see if I am.
You're afraid.
Marius, you don't want to see me roused.
Don't I?
You miserable wretch.
Wretch?
Did you call me a wretch?
Leave this to us men.
Hold my hat.
- Go on, hit me!
- Box my ears.
- Miserable wretch.
- Poor boy.
- Shopkeeper!
- All talk and no action.
- You're all hot air.
- If I'd less control...
- If your hair weren't gray.
You want me to tear it out? Is that it?
You've got customers.
Thank your lucky stars.
Fanny, business calls.
Will you come over for tea later?
I'll never set foot in this bar again. People should know their place.
Your Parisian accent doesn't impress me.
I will expect you later.
Two anisettes at two francs twenty-five. That's four francs fifty.
Here's five francs.
Keep the change... waiter.
You shouldn't get worked up over things that don't concern you.
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes!
It's shameful what you're doing to that poor old man. What poor old man?
You might have killed him.
When he looked down your blouse, he went as red as a lobster.
You went redder.
Besides, I'm wearing a bra.
- And it's none of your business anyway.
I've got better things to worry about.
I don't like to see you becoming like your Aunt Zoé.
Don't I have a right to marry?
Come on.
Think it through.
Marriage doesn't end at the church.
It's a start.
- And after that?
- The wedding breakfast.
- Then what?
- He'll kiss you.
- If he must.
He'll kiss you on the neck and lips.
Don't talk about that.
I have to. It'll be too late afterwards.
He'll take you in his arms... the dirty old man.
Dirty bastard!
You can laugh, but it's not true.
What's not true?
You have to be in love to be jealous.
Exactly. And I'm not.
We're friends, nothing more.
Mind you, I could easily have fallen for you. You're so pretty.
But I didn't want to.
- Can you look after the place a moment?
- What if there's a customer?
I won't be long.
Bartoli will take you on.
Ten months?
Suez, Aden, Bombay, Colombo, Makassar,
The same voyage as the Malaisie.
It's not a sure thing yet.
I've signed on a Corsican.
But if he's not here tonight, you can take his place.
We sail at midnight.
So soon?
So much the better.
- How will I know?
- I'll come and tell you.
Your papers are in order?
Just a headache.
Was that why you were crying all night long too?
Enough of this nonsense.
Tell me the truth.
I'm leaving for Aix tonight, and I'm not going till you tell me.
Don't worry, Mother.
I suppose it's that worthless Marius.
I've been watching him for a long time.
How stupid can you be?
You can have Monsieur Panisse.
Such a nice man, so kind, so charming and so rich too.
Yet you weep over a boy who washes glasses.
Well, if that's what you want, I won't stop you.
Come on, you little ninny.
If you want him, you'll have him.
He doesn't want me.
He doesn't want you?
He said that?
Where? Why?
Go and tell Panisse to come over for some champagne.
It's only a step.
Get a move on.
- What will you give me if I go?
- A glass of wine.
Now go!
Come and have some champagne with Monsieur César.
You damned idiot!
You'll have every drunk in town rushing in here.
Here's some for you.
I didn't see you yesterday.
Let's have some champagne.
Since you ask me, it would be impolite to refuse.
But I swore I'd never set foot in this place again.
Why would you swear that?
Your son was very rude.
My son was rude?
Yes, very rude.
Next time I see him, I will kick him in the backside.
Notice I'm not wearing espadrilles.
I've got shoes on today.
- You say that to me?
- Yes, to you.
Lay a hand on Marius and I'll kick you so hard your teeth will chatter.
Lay a finger on Marius and you'll wake up in the hospital.
Touch one hair of his head and you'll wake up in the cemetery.
I've knocked out bigger men than you.
Holy Virgin, it's murder- but you asked for it.
The champagne!
What a pity.
It's not chilled.
Yes, it's a bit warm.
But it's not bad.
I'll put a bottle down the well for tomorrow.
We'll soon arrange it. Don't worry.
But if you don't want Monsieur Panisse, you should tell him so right away.
I'll speak to César, that brute!
No, Mother, please don't tell anyone.
Let me deal with this myself, please.
I promise.
Though I'd like to give that barman who rejected you a piece of my mind!
Come on, silly.
And don't cry into it.
It's salty enough as it is.
Panisse, if you meet Marius, don't kick him.
You know I won't.
It was only my pride talking.
To your health.
- What did the boy do?
- He provoked me.
He mocked me and my gray hair.
You must have said something.
You picked a quarrel with him.
I know I've got a quick temper, but I'd never start a quarrel that could end in a massacre.
I wasn't even looking at him when he pounced on me.
Really?
He tried to strangle me.
If he starts throttling my customers, what will become of us?
- Something's wrong with that boy.
I don't know. Haven't you noticed anything?
Yes, that he tried to strangle me.
That's not important.
Do you know if he has a mistress?
It's a woman, mark my words.
Love makes men so stupid.
You don't think he fancies Fanny, do you?
Surely not.
They've known each other too long.
I say that because, when he attacked me, I was sitting beside Fanny.
- Meaning what?
- Maybe he thought I was courting her.
You?
Go on. You're joking.
He wouldn't be jealous of an old man like you.
Look at you.
You're like an old monkey.
No, a woman must be making him suffer.
I'm afraid it's
Madame Escartefigue.
She's made enough men happy.
She'd hardly turn away the son of a friend.
Speak to Marius.
I suppose I must.
Marius may be 23, but I'd still cuff him if need be.
All the same, I can't talk to him about women.
- It's my stupid modesty.
- Modesty?
Paternal modesty.
You're very fastidious.
You'd feel the same way if you had a son.
This shoe is pressing on my corn.
Those are fine shoes you have there.
- Are they torpedoes too?
- They're my wedding shoes.
You must have kept them in mothballs.
They're so tight, I think they'll burst.
Maybe they won't come off.
I can always use scissors.
No hard feelings, César?
Don't worry about your son.
It will pass.
You look like a ballet dancer.
Don't go playing football in those shoes.
Good-bye, my friend.
She's a fine ship.
Come on board.
Still out at this hour?
I'm leaving on the midnight train to see my sister.
I came here early because I wanted to talk to you.
Go ahead.
- It's not that easy.
It's about Fanny.
Fanny... and Marius.
That's a nice hat.
What will you have to drink?
A mandarin and lemon.
What's up between Fanny and Marius?
Is it so hard to say?
Panisse wants my child.
In marriage.
Panisse wants to marry Fanny?
He asked me this morning.
He's out of his mind.
He wants my answer tomorrow.
What does Fanny say?
She'll say yes if she can't have the one she wants.
And it's Marius she wants?
Now I understand yesterday's carnage.
A terrible fight.
It was pandemonium.
Marius wants her to reject Panisse.
Did he say he loved her?
He hinted at it.
Did he kiss her?
He hinted at it, she said.
Without kissing her?
That's odd.
But they want each other?
Marius said he couldn't marry her.
He won't say why.
He doesn't answer, and he makes her cry.
What's he waiting for?
Don't lose your temper, Norine.
Maybe he doesn't love her.
Then why is he jealous of Panisse?
This should be easy to settle.
Do it then, because if my child goes on crying, I'll set fire to this place.
Calm down now, and sit down.
We'll ask Marius about it when he comes in.
- Not me.
He mustn't know I was here.
I know what men are like.
If he hears I came to ask, whenever she lets fall a remark, he'll say,
"You asked for me.
Your mother said you cried," etc.
He'll hate her, and they'll be unhappy.
But Fanny mustn't talk about Panisse either.
I know what women are like.
Their first quarrel and she'll say,
"I turned down a wealthy man for you.
I'd have had a car, a maid, a boat," etc.
It would be the end of him.
I know all about that from my poor wife.
In 20 years she never let me forget the cattle dealer who proposed to her.
But there'll never be another like her.
You say nothing, and I'll see she never mentions Panisse.
Shall we drink to it?
To your health.
Do you like the idea of this marriage?
That remains to be seen.
What would you give Fanny?
The cockle business.
With a good assistant, it could bring in 40 francs a day, net profit.
That's not much.
Some people would be glad to take her with nothing.
My girl isn't a hunchback.
And my boy isn't lame.
You may find taller, bigger men, but none more handsome.
Laugh if you like, but it's the truth.
I'm not saying it because the lad's mine, but he's a fine boy.
Very handsome!
Don't make me angry.
Just 'cause he's handsome, does he have to marry a Rothschild?
Of course not. But, if they get married right away, and if they have kids, they'll need money.
In that case, I'd give them an allowance as long as I had my fish stall.
What will you give your boy?
He'll help me in the bar till I retire.
They can live here.
And I'll give him 1,500 francs a month.
You must give him more than that.
You should give him a cod steak, some fresh turbot, a few crabs and some bream.
You better stop drinking.
It's bad for you.
I'd rather have some crayfish.
Is this for fish soup?
Fish soup.
So you're just getting in?
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Yes, that sort of soup won't keep.
I'm off.
Hello, my dear.
What can I do for you?
Where did you go tonight?
I was playing billiards at the Brasserie Suisse.
I'm sure that's not true.
You were somewhere else.
I've something serious to tell you.
What?
I've lost my cap.
Behind you, on the table.
One of these days you'll get married.
It's natural, and good for business.
Surely you don't want to remain a bachelor.
I've given it no thought.
Maybe it's time you did.
Panisse has asked Fanny to marry him.
I don't see the connection.
Marius, don't take me for an idiot.
Can't you hear me? Don't take me for an idiot.
I know you love Fanny.
A clever little bird.
You love Fanny, and I can prove it.
That's why you attacked Panisse like a wild beast, nearly throttling the poor old chap.
He's out to find you.
He's put shoes on. He's walking around like this.
- We just had a little quarrel about... - About what?
I don't even know what.
It was about Fanny.
You wanted to eliminate a rival.
You idiot. If you want to eliminate your rival, propose to Fanny.
You think she'd accept?
You talked to her mother?
What was that?
What do you mean?
Ah, her mother.
She has a pretty hat.
No, I didn't talk to her, but I think she'd say yes.
But I'm not interested.
I don't think I love her enough to marry her.
You're lying.
- 'Cause you're lying.
- I'm lying?
I said you're lying.
You love Fanny.
You're furious because someone else wants her, yet you refuse to marry her.
You're very trying, Marius.
If you're crazy, be honest and tell me.
I'll send you to the loony bin.
If you're not, trust me and tell the truth.
There's a woman at the bottom of this, isn't there?
Yes... you're right.
I guessed as much.
I'm embarrassed to talk about it.
But I want to know why you're being so stupid.
You can't love the girl.
Maybe I pity her.
And that's what makes you stupid?
Listen, Marius.
All right, I'll explain.
I loved a girl, and she's in love with me.
I'd hurt her if I said I was getting married.
She might kill herself.
Don't exaggerate.
I need time to get her used to the idea.
It's as simple as that.
Well, let's forget it.
I won't ask her name, because you wouldn't tell me.
It's not Madame Escartefigue, is it?
No, it isn't.
- I just told you.
Be careful.
Monsieur Escartefigue is a friend of mine, and a good customer.
I don't want you playing around with the customers' wives.
We won't say anything more about it.
But what shall we do about Fanny?
Leave it.
Give me the receipts.
- What if she accepts Panisse?
- She won't accept.
But if she did.
If she accepts him, it's just too bad.
Stop that nonsense.
That's no way to talk.
We'll go over it in the morning.
It's going to prey on my mind all night.
I doubt it, the way you're yawning.
I'm very fond of you, you know.
I'm very fond of you.b
I'm fond of you too.
What made you say that?
I don't know.s
You've been thinking and worrying about me.
It reminds me that I love you.
Good night. son.
Sometimes I say you'll be the death of me.
Has the Corsican come?
The big ship isn't in the harbor yet, but she's coming.p
Go quickly.
When you come back, knock on the shutter.
See you tomorrow.
And don't worry about me.
It's nothing.d
I forgot the key to my stall, so I couldn't lock up till I'd gotten it.
Then I saw a light through the crack, so I knocked.
I'm glad you did.n
Besides, I wanted to tell you
- I followed your advice.
I turned down Panisse.
Perhaps that was a mistake.
You advised me to do it.
Maybe you were a bit hasty.
Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut and not taken the responsibility.
Listen, Fanny... my father hasn't gone to bed yet.
See you tomorrow.n
Since you're turning me away.
I'm not turning you away.
Fanny, don't be angry.
Come in for a moment.
Let's talk about this marriage.
I want to speak to you like a brother.
But you're not.
- You're like my sister.
- No, I'm not.
What is it, Fanny?
It's you I love and you I want.
Do me a favor and don't look at me.
You shouldn't have told me.
Don't you love me too?
Yes, you love me.
Tell me you do.
I can't marry.
Because you have a mistress?
Come out with it.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I asked Anna if it was her.
- What?
- What will she think?
- I couldn't care less.
I won't rest till I've found out who it is.
- It's no one!
- Some girl has sunk her claws into you.
Maybe she's had a child by you.
You've got a child?
I can't say I have when I haven't.
Then it's just that you don't want me.
Are you ashamed of my Aunt Zoé?
If I were going to get married, I'd marry you.
Now don't ask any more questions.
Who's with you?
I'm tidying up.
Listen to that.
Can't you sleep?
Go to bed, you idiot.
Check the third beer keg and make sure the tap is turned off.
I'll take a look.s
We'll talk again tomorrow.
You might not understand. You might betray me.
Betray you? e
All right. I'll tell you.
- Leaving?
Anywhere.
Is it your father?
What is driving you away?
Nothing... it's just a longing.
Take me with you..
No, I can't.
It's the sea!
Is this Piquoiseau's idea?
No. I've wanted to go for a long time.
One night, a sailing ship berthed right here.
Her cargo was wood from the West Indies.
Black wood, all golden inside, smelling of camphor and pepper.
The ship came from the Leeward Islands.
The crew came in here and told me about their country.
I drank the rum they'd brought.
It was very sweet and spicy.
Then, one night, they left, and I went out on the pier.
I looked at that fine three-master sailing into the sun
towards the Leeward Islands.
Since then, I've been under a spell.
Was there a woman on the boat?
I knew you wouldn't understand.
Is it the islands, then?
I'd prefer never to go there, but to keep them as I imagined them.
I long for distant places.
It's something I can't explain, but that's how it is.
And that's why you want to leave me?
Now that you know, you'd better go.
If I go now, I feel I may never see you again.
You'll see me here in the morning.
You're leaving tonight.
If they call me.
Marius, please, don't go.
Go on some other boat, some other day.
You don't love me.
I don't love you?
If I didn't, I'd have left long ago.
- But now I've made up my mind. - But why?
Can't you understand why?
When I'm on the pier, looking at the sky, I'm already away.
Every ship on the sea tugs at me.
I forget where I am, what I'm doing.
It's as if I were mad.
Remember when we went on the transporter bridge?
You were dizzy, afraid you'd fall.
That's how I feel.
When I see a ship leaving,
I'm drawn towards her.
I can't control myself.
I wouldn't make you happy.
You've only got one life.
I'd ruin it.
If you leave, my life is finished.
You're young. You'll forget.
That's impossible, Marius.
I've always loved you, even when I still had pigtails.
When you were in the army,
I learned to sew, so I could wear a new dress when you came on leave.
Every time you spoke to a girl, I wished she'd drop dead.
You were always in my dreams of the future.
I longed to grow up to become your wife.
Every morning I thought, "He'll say something today."
I've tried everything to make you talk.
And now that you've said you love me, you're leaving.
Someone knocked!
I'll love you always, Marius.
It's no use crying. It won't change my mind.
Never, Marius.
I'll wait for you.
Don't.
I'll leave again.
Don't answer!
r I'll drown myself.
The Corsican is back.
You're not leaving, Marius.
Don't be sad - please.
I'll love you so much you'll be cured.
It's over now, Marius.
I'm keeping you.
Give us a bottle of rum.
You're still up.
We can see your light.
What's all that noise about?
We want some rum.d
There's no rum.
We're closed.
Are you in bed?
Dad's coming down.r
What can he be doing? n
Never.r
It's your turn to play.
I know, but I can't decide.
Make up your mind.
We're all waiting, Captain.
It's a serious moment.
They're ahead.
This hand settles the game.
Is Panisse trumping hearts?
If you'd been concentrating, you'd know.
Why don't you just show him your cards?
I never said a thing.
You're not allowed to speak.
In a competition, you'd be disqualified.
I've played in lots of competitions, but I never saw you at any of them.
I still don't know if Panisse is trumping hearts.
When you're playing, you mustn't say anything.
I'm only thinking aloud.
Well, don't.
There's no need to talk.
I must ask you not to make signs.
Keep your eyes on your cards.
You too! o
If you go on making faces, I'm going home.
They've lost anyway.
I wouldn't hesitate a second if I knew Panisse was trumping hearts.
There they go, making faces.
You watch him, and I'll watch César.
You'd treat an old school buddy like a cheat?
Have I upset you?
Not at all.
Treat me like a gangster.
Go ahead.
You break my heart.
You break my heart!
Aren't we playing any longer?
He broke my heart.
What about you?
I see. Good.
Hearts.
Do you take me for a fool?
You gave him to understand I was trumping hearts.
There, take your cards!
I don't play with cheats!
Nobody takes Panisse for a ride.
Breaking your heart indeed!
He's not pleased.
He's really cross.
You really shouldn't have cheated.
If you can't cheat among friends, why bother to play?
And it was a clever ruse.
He has such a temper. He's impossible.
Let's play one last hand.
Loser pays for the drinks.
Off to bed already?
No, I'm taking Mother to the station.
That's a very nice thing to do.
See she catches her train.
It's a good thing Fanny doesn't know where he's going.
- He's off to see his old mistress.
- That rascal!
- He'll spend the night there.
- Tell us more.
In a minute he'll come out and say, "Good night, Dad."
I'll say, "Going out?" And he'll say, "Yes, to the movies."
He goes out, climbs back through the window, and locks his door on the inside.
I wake him in the morning.
If the door is locked, I think he's sleeping.
He's not stupid, my son, but then, neither am I.
I've never told him that I've looked in through his window.
It's all good fun.
Going out?
Just to the movies.
Need any money? a
I have enough.
Doesn't he look smart?
Smarter than both of you.
I didn't really mean it.
A bow tie, even.
- Don't be late.
- Midnight or 1:00. No later.
And be good.
He'll be off round the back now.
Tell me, César... who is Marius's mistress?
I've never tried to find out.
It's a delicate issue.
The boy is an adult now.
But I suspect it's a sailor's wife.
If he spends the whole night with her, her husband must be away.
Thirty-seven? j
Besides, everyone knows the navy is full of cuckolds.
What? i
The navy is full of cuckolds. I called 40!
Feeling cold?
You need your jacket on?
Was it what I said about the navy?
Forgive me, old chap.
Are you speaking to the sailor or the cuckold?
Both.v
It's no laughing matter.
There's no need to be so angry.
It's not your fault you're a cuckold.
After all, everyone knows.
Monsieur Brun didn't.
He's the one who told me!
Besides, it's common knowledge.
It's none of your business, and I forbid you to insult the French navy.
After what you said, I can play no longer.
That's the end of it.
I'll expect your apology in the morning.
If it's an apology you want, I'll say I'm sorry right now.
No, I demand an apology that reflects the gravity of your remarks.
Come on, Felix, don't be stupid.
I had no intention of insulting the navy.
I admire the French navy..
Maybe you do admire the French navy, but the French navy says go to hell!
What on earth did he mean?
It's not nice what they've done to you.
They've left you to pay for the drinks.
You mean they left us to pay?
Yes, we were partners.
- We'll play for it.
- It's rather late.
We've never played écarté together, have we?
And you wanted to leave for the land of the monkeys!
Wasn't that silly? o
It was totally inexplicable.
You won't think about it anymore, will you?
Not as I did before.
The spell is broken forever.
- So when do we marry?
I'll talk to Dad in the morning and your mother tomorrow evening.
Shall I tell you my idea for where we'll live?
- You've got a plan?
- I've already imagined everything.
Go on then. Tell me.
We'll take over your father's room.
That's a bad start.
Father will never give it up.
w
Think about it.
That's where Mother died.
Since she died, nothing has been moved.
All right, then, we'll use yours.
I'll fix it up real nice.
I'll have it papered in blue - it goes well with my hair.
Then there's the furniture.
Between the windows I'll put Aunt Zoé's chest of drawers.
It's very old and worth a lot of money.
On the other side...y
It's a ship sounding its horn so it doesn't have a collision.
It must be a big ship.
What are we going to put across from the chest of drawers?
I'm putting down a king.
Another?
- I do it all the time.
- That could seem odd.
Not odd, but difficult.
You admit you're cheating?
Yes. But since you can't detect it, it's all right.
Then I may as well pay at once.
What does it come to?
That will be 24 francs.
That hat suits you.
And here's two francs for the waiter.
I'll give it to him later.
Well, good-bye, Monsieur Brun.
Don't tell anyone Escartefigue is a cuckold!
He's not here.
Where there's Fanny, there's Marius.
Sorry to disturb you.
Marius, I must talk to you.
Listen, Marius, I wanted to say...
Say it in front of me, or go.
All right. I'm sorry, I'm sure.
I'll wait for you in front of your bar.
Good night, lovebirds.
That's a nuisance.
He'll know I haven't gone home to sleep.
You can say he missed you.
He's bound to tell everyone.
I'd better get rid of him at once.
- You'll tell me everything?
Hurry up!
The mate of the Malaisie wants to see you.
All the time I've been here, you've said you wanted to go.
I've had to send an injured man to the hospital.
I gave the captain your papers, and now you want to back out.
You should have said so sooner.
I can't go.r
I'll never trust a Marseillais again.
I need more courage to stay than go.
I'll say- shifting bottles!
- I bet it's on account of a girl.
That cockle girl?
She's nice enough, but there are girls the world over.
Are you that badly smitten?
- I have to stay.
I owe it to her.
Plenty of men wouldn't give a damn.
It's up to you, but you'll live to regret it.
Never more than now.
He's desperate to go.
I'd do anything to go.
I'm desperate to go, but we can't always do what we want.
It's no use insisting.n
Then I'll offer the job to Chevalier.
I'll come to the bar tomorrow at 11:00 to say good-bye.
That lad is going to cry every night.
Where's Chevalier?
Don't look for him.s
You said he'd cry every night.
Do you really think he will?
Listen, young lady,r it's obvious the lad won't always be happy.
You saw how he cried.
You're destroying his life.
Could you wait till tomorrow morning to replace him?
He might go.
Whatever you do, he'll refuse to go now.
Come to the bar tomorrow at 10:00.
But don't tell him you saw me.
Go, hurry!
What did Piquoiseau want?
He just wanted some money.
I gave him some.
Promise you'll never love another woman.
You know I won't.
I'll never love another woman.
You say you pity her. Since last night, you've had plenty of time for that.
Time you had pity on your father.
I can't believe it.
Oh, good God!
look at that.
You recognize that belt? e
Did Marius have an accident?
He deserves to, the bastard.
Though anyone else would have been worse.
They must get married at once.
What's wrong?
I went to Aix as I do every Wednesday.
- You go to Aix every Wednesday?
- To see my sister.
I didn't take the train back because Monsieur Amourdedieu gave me a lift.
When I arrived home, what did I find?
A bottle, two glasses... and that belt on a chair.
Who'd have thought it?
Though a belt means nothing.
It made my blood run cold.
I ran to Fanny's room and opened the door.
Holy Virgin, what have I done?
My goodness.
I was so ashamed.i
I left without a sound.
Marius, that's going a bit far.
What have you done, my son?
He's a real rascal.
She's only 18.
She'll end up like her Aunt Zoé.
How can you say that about Fanny?
It doesn't encourage me to give my consent.
Don't cry, Honorine.
We'll think of something.
Come on, stop crying.
It'd be worse if she'd broken a leg.
Who'd ever have thought it?
She seemed so innocent - such a child.
Let's hope there's none on the way.
How can you laugh about it?
Don't you see what it's doing to me?
I'm in such a state..
- What will you have?
- Just a mandarin and lemon.
It's a nuisance, but life isn't all laughs.
Things will turn out all right.
Don't cry into the croissants.
That won't help matters.
I mean, really.o
Let's have a drink and examine the situation.
It's quite simple.
I'm going to tear Fanny apart.
You wouldn't do that.
Just you watch.
Let me go, César.
I'll kill her.
Come, Honorine.
Have a seat and calm down.
Do you want the whole town to know?
- Think about yourself.
- There's no time for that.
What if your mother had killed you when you were Curly's fiancée?
That was different.
He lived just across the hall.
And it was I who went across to him.
Your Marius...
I never told Fanny about that.
Don't cry.
Damn your Marius!
How dare he come to my own house?
He raped my daughter.
She can't have screamed very loud.
We'll marry them and say no more about it.
Children are something.
They're so nice when they're tiny.
But what can you expect?
Youth doesn't last long.
I know, but all the same...
My poor Norine.
Youth passes all too quickly and never comes back.
That will be Marius climbing back in.
I'd strangle him.
No, not that way.
Go into the kitchen.
And stop crying.
Stop crying.
You trust me, don't you?
I promise you they'll be married in two weeks.
You can dry your eyes on the dishcloth.
It's clean.
He'll have to stop showing pity now.m
I'll give him time to rehearse his little charade.
Just getting here? .
I did the housework before coming.
You must have done a very thorough job of it.
Meanwhile, your stall isn't open.
I've got a good mind to give you a thrashing!
You should cry after what you've done.
I was home at 7:00. Do you follow me?
No, I can't.
It's unpardonable.
You, my own daughter!
Couldn't you have gotten married first? None of us was against it.
You behaved like Zoé.
You might have waited till it was legal.
He wanted to see you asleep?
He has to marry you.
I want a proposal by midday.
Tell your Marius to hurry up or else!
I've never touched a gun in my life, but I swear I'll learn real quick!
I'll talk to him myself.
No, Mother!
If he refuses, don't bother coming home.
You'll no longer be my daughter.
I'll lock myself in my room and drown in my own tears.
Mother, please don't cry.
Look at that thief.
What are you after?
The fishmonger.
What do you want?
The Hotel Universal placed an order.
That's right.
The fish are still in the tank.
I'll be right over.
I won't kiss you until you're engaged.
No, Fanny, don't.
Let me go.
Just getting up?
Just past 9:00.
Gosh!
I stayed up reading in bed last night. It was dawn before I fell asleep.
You shouldn't stay up reading so late.
It's bad for your health.
You don't look too good.
I don't?
Those books you read must be very tiring.
If I didn't know better, I'd wonder where you'd been.
Did you call me around 7:00?
Just before 7:00.
I called you, but you went on sleeping.
We heard your snores in here.
That's impossible.
Why? u
I never snore.
You even made the customers laugh.
Your door was locked, so that was that.
Yes, I must have locked it without thinking.
Without thinking, eh?
Pour your coffee.
Breakfast is ready.
Your trousers are sliding down.
- Looks that way.
Maybe I've lost weight.
At this rate, you'll end up thin as a rake.
Why don't you wear a belt?
You're right. I have to get one.
That's easily done.
What a boy.
You've got a good appetite.
Not bad.
Reading makes you hungry.
What a boy.r
Tell me.That old mistress of yours.
You know, the woman you pitied so much.
The one who might kill herself.
- You're still seeing her?
You're truly amazing.
What a boy!
Tell me... did you tell her you're getting married?
Not yet, but all the same...
I gave her to understand that someday...
You don't explain too well, but I get the picture.
You may be being kind to that girl, but it's hardly fair on Fanny.
Why?
Because you're keeping her dangling.
- Have you decided to marry her?
Then why don't you talk to us parents?
- She keeps postponing the date.
Whenever I ask her, she says, "We've got plenty of time."
- That's odd.
Sometimes I wonder if she prefers Panisse.
She couldn't care less about that old man.
- Then why keep putting it off?
- That's your fault.
Yes, it's your fault!
You don't understand women yet.
Let me explain.
Women are proud and easily hurt.
And it's no use trying to hide things from them. They've got a sixth sense.
Fanny sees you're in no hurry, so she says, "We've got plenty of time."
But if you said, "Meet me at the church tomorrow,"
- I know I'm right.
I'm right, I tell you.
When you see Fanny, have a serious talk with her.
You should bear in mind what happened to Zoé.
Such a nice girl.
I don't see what she has to do with me.
You don't know the story?
It's not very pretty.
Zoé was good-looking, a bit of a flirt, but she meant no harm.
I can still see her passing by the bar.
So cute under her big straw hat.
She had a way about her.
All the men watched her.
She'd smile at them, but it never went further than that.
Then she fell for a Spanish sailor.
He promised to marry her, and said he'd stay.
So they rushed things a bit.
And then one day he left.
He deserted her?
He deserted her.
Then Zoé...
It was terrible.
The poor kid.
Poor girl.
When a man deceives a woman, she feels a great revulsion.
She can never love again, and she takes to the streets.
And, once she gets started there, she has nothing to lose.
Honor is like a match. It can only be used once.
Why tell me all this? o
So you don't just use Fanny for a good time.
Understand? b
I'm sure she's a virgin, and I've seen and know nothing.
But if you've been exchanging glances and caresses,t you must get married as soon as possible.
Talk to her.
Be very insistent.
Because, if you want my opinion, that sailor of Zoé's was no man.
Are you coming?
No.
I told you last night.
Did you get a replacement?
No, I thought you might change your mind.
You shouldn't have come.
Especially to tell me that.
You're staying here?
But if you change your mind, we're across the quay.
I won't change my mind.
You're making a mistake.
A big mistake.
Why did you tell me he'd go?
Now I'm short a man.
He'll be coming.
Yes, it certainly looks like it!
Go get your mother. We must speak to her at once!
Why the hurry?
If you love me, don't lose a moment.
Do you really want to marry me so much?
Marriage is a serious business.
It ties you down for life.
Call your mother, I tell you.
Are you sure you love me enough?
You saw that ship out there?
- The Malaisie.
I've got a place on the crew.
Theyjust told me.
My bag is packed.
I've only got to cross the quay. But, as you see, I'm staying.
Here, with you.
Forever, if you help me.
But you'll never be happy if you marry me.
You want to marry me because you feel responsible.
But there's no need.
You asked for nothing.
It was I who came to you.
The fault is entirely mine.
Go, Marius.
Follow your desires.
They don't include me.
Fanny, don't tempt me.
Just cross the quay.
If you love me, take me in your arms, cover my eyes.
Hold me as tight as you can.
You don't have to suffer.
You've still got time.
I've thought of that.
You've thought of that?
Or someone else.
You've spoken to him?
Have you?
Several times.a
So you were lying when you said you'd turned him down?
I'm not doing it for myself.
I have to think of my mother.
She's not as young as she was.
Love isn't the only thing in life.
There are other things stronger than love.
So, while I've been struggling with my conscience and suffering in silence,
this was all being arranged.e
You see?
Go ahead and marry Panisse's money.
I'm marrying the sea.
You're staying after all?
I can't get by.
My father's standing out there.
Marius...s climb out the window as if you were going to meet your love.
In the meantime, I'll keep your father here.
No, don't say anything!
If he'd loved me as I love him, he'd have understood.
Marius is over there.
He wants to see you.
No, he's at the station, getting my baskets.
- He won't be long.
- What's wrong with you?
I don't like what I see going on.
You should open your eyes.
You idiot, I saw it all a long time ago.
How flushed you are.
Have you been crying? Is that it?
Then Marius must have talked to you.
So it's settled?
I'm glad to hear that.
Do you know how long I've been thinking about this wedding?
Months? a
For the last 11 - no, more like 14 years.
Since before you left for Algeria, when you were knee-high to a grasshopper.
One night, in this very bar, Marius's mother lifted you up and asked,
"Fanny, are you really going to marry Marius?"
Everyone laughed - except you.
With wide eyes, you said, "Yes."
And now it's happening.
Let's take a stroll on the quay.
- But the customers...
- Let them wait.
I'd prefer to stay here.
We've got things to talk about.
Where we'll live.
We'll need a room.
You'll live here with me.
You don't think I want to live alone, do you?
You know, I bully Marius from time to time, but he's my son, after all.
I'd die if I didn't see him for six months.
I've an idea for your lodgings.
Have you seen my room?
Then I'll show it to you.
It's nice here.
You can't imagine how nice it is in the morning to be woken up by the sun.
In summer it reaches the bed.
And in winter it climbs up to the clock.
Well, what do you think of this room?
It's larger than Marius's.
Much larger.
So this is what I thought.
I'm old now.
I don't need so much space.
I'll take Marius's room, and this one will be yours.
Yes, there's certainly more space.
There's only one thing I'd ask of you.
Leave the bed where it is.
Yes... that's where he was born.
And it's also where she died.
The ship's leaving.
That's the Malaisie leaving.
God protect all who sail on her.
You see that door?
It leads to a small little room.
Well, if you'd like - and I'd like it very much - we'll find a tiny bed.
We'll put a tiny bed in there, won't we?
Marius, bring some rum!
Fanny has fainted!
Marius, where have you gone?
- Sorry to have to report... there are four stowaways in the forward hatch.
Stowaways? How do you know there are four of them?
They were singing Sweet Adeline.
Get them out of there, you hear?
But we can't find them.
And besides, they've been writing insulting notes.
So, I'm an old goat, am I?
Find them if you have to clear out that whole hatch!
- Captain, when do we get in?
- In all my dreams
- Your fair face beams
You're the idol of my heart
Sweet Adeline
My Adeline
This is the only way to travel, boys. The only way.
I was gonna bring the wife and kiddies... but the grocer couldn't spare another barrel.
I was gonna bring my grandfather, but there's no room for his beard.
Why not send for the old swine, let his beard come later?
- I sent for his beard.
- You did? It's coming by "hair" mail.
Fellas, I think I hear someone.
If it's the captain, I'm gonna have a few words with him.
My hot water's been cold for three days and I haven't got room to swing a cat.
In fact, I haven't even got a cat.
- My grandfather can swing a cat.
- He can?
That'd make a good job for him.
Come on, men. Snap it up.
Listen, fellas.
We've got to find those stowaways.
- And when we do, we'll put them in irons.
Take a look in behind those cases.
You fellows, look behind those boxes.
- Never mind the barrels.
- I just said "aye, aye, sir."
- Never mind that.
Find those men.
- They're not here, sir.
- Oh, yes, they are.
Hoist all this stuff up on deck.
- And get these barrels out of the way.
- Very well, sir.
Lower away up there.
Hurry up with that sling.
- You'll never find them standing around.
You look in back of those bales.
- You look in those boxes.
Make it snappy up there!
You fellas, go aft.
You fellas, take a look in behind those lifeboats.
Captain, tell us about the stowaways.
I'll have them in the brig before long.
That's terribly romantic.
I'd love to meet a stowaway.
Are these your gloves?
I found them in your trunk.
- Go to your rooms.
I'll be down shortly. - Who are you?
Are you the floorwalker?
I want to register a complaint.
- Matter enough.
You know who sneaked into my stateroom at 3:00 a.m.?
- Nobody, and that's my complaint.
I want gaiety, laughter, ha-cha-cha.
I wanna dance till the cows come home
Just what do you mean by this?
I don't like the way you're running this boat.
Get in the backseat and let your wife drive.
I've been captain of this ship for 22 years.
Twenty-two years?
If you were a man, you'd go in business for yourself.
I know a fellow, started last year with a canoe.
He has more women than you can shake a stick at, if you enjoy that.
One more word, and I'll throw you in irons.
You can't do it with irons. It's a mashie shot.
It's a mashie shot if the wind is against you.
If the wind isn't, I am.
How about those barrels down below?
- I wouldn't put a pig in there.
- See here, you...
Not even if you got down on your knees.
And here's your gloves.
You would take them, wouldn't you?
And keep away from my office.
Now, see here, you!
How dare you invade the sanctity of the captain's quarters?
I thought you was the captain.
I'm gonna find something to eat.
I'll take care of that.
Hello. - Send up the captain's lunch.
Send up his dinner, too.
I'm the captain.
You want to choose up sides?
Engineer, will you tell them to stop the boat from rocking?
I'm gonna have lunch.
- What's the matter with me?
I'm hungry. - I didn't eat in three days.
- Three days?
- We've only been on the boat two days.
- I didn't eat yesterday... I didn't eat today, and I won't eat tomorrow.
That makes three days.
State your business. I've got to shiver my timbers.
I got no business.
I come up to see the captain's bridge.
Captain's bridge?
I'm sorry. He always keeps it in a glass... while he's eating.
Would you like to see where he sleeps?
That's the bunk.
You're wasting your breath, and that's no great loss.
A fine sailor you are.
You bet I'm a fine sailor.
You know, my whole family was sailors?
My father was partners with Columbus. What do you think of that?
- Your father and Columbus were partners?
- You bet. Columbus has been dead 400 years.
They told me it was my father.
Hop up there, and I'll show you a few things you don't know about history.
There's Columbus.
That's Columbus Circle.
Would you mind getting up off that flypaper and giving the flies a chance?
You're crazy. Flies can't read papers.
Now, Columbus sailed from Spain to India looking for a shortcut.
You mean strawberry shortcut.
When I woke up, there was the nurse taking care of me.
What's the matter? Couldn't the nurse take care of herself?
You bet she could, but I found it out too late.
Enough of this.
Let's get back to Columbus.
- I'd rather get back to the nurse.
But Columbus was sailing along on his vessel.
- On his what?
- Not on his what. On his vessel.
- Don't you know what "vessel" is?
- Sure. I can vessel.
Do you suppose I could buy back my introduction to you?
Now, one night Columbus' sailors started a mutiny.
No mutinies at night.
They're in the afternoon.
You know, mutinies Wednesdays and Saturdays.
There's my argument.
Restrict immigration.
Of all the colossal impudence!
Why don't you stand up?
Can't you see he has no chair?
- Why, you...
- You better keep quiet.
We're a couple of big stockholders in this company.
Stockholders?
You look like a couple of stowaways to me.
Don't forget that the stockholder of yesteryear is the stowaway of today.
Well, you look exactly like them.
What do they look like?
One of them goes around with a black moustache.
So do I. If I had my choice, I'd go around with a little blonde.
I said one goes around with a black moustache.
You couldn't expect a moustache to go around by itself.
Don't you think a moustache ever gets lonely, Captain?
Sure, it gets lonely.
When my grandfather's beard gets here, I'd like it to meet your moustache.
I'll talk it over with my moustache.
Has your grandfather's beard got any money?
- Money? Why, it fell hair to a fortune.
- Now, listen!
Stockholders or no stockholders, you clear out of here!
There's someone in that room.
There's somebody in that closet, and I think it's you, Captain.
- Now, we can eat in peace. - All right.
Here's a piece for you.
That a baby.
- Beg pardon, Captain.
- How dare you enter the captain's quarters...
- while I'm eating.
Don't forget the butter.
You know, there's some mighty pretty country around here.
- Pardon me.
Is this yours? - Why, no.
As I was saying, there's some mighty beautiful country around here.
- The trees are lovely.
- You bet they are. I love them.
Gibson. Come out of there.
I want to report I found a...
Gibson, you've been drinking again... and you know what my orders were.
But those stowaways, I just caught one of them in there.
- Stowaway, huh?
- Yes. There he is.
You're choking me!
That's one now.
That's a dummy. Come with me.
First officer.
I'm telling you, that's him.
This has gone far enough.
Get up to your quarters.
Would you like anything before lunch?
Yes, breakfast.
Nobody eats in here.
Mustard's no good without roast beef.
Do you want your nails trimmed long?
About an hour and a half.
I got nothing to do.
You're a nice-looking gal, all right.
You got it.
And you can keep it.
That's a nice gal?
You're next, Cap.
I'm looking for a couple of mugs.
- No, you boys look on B Deck.
How about a shave?
- Sure. Give me a once-over.
- Once-over, partner.
- No, a shave.
- On the face. All right.
- Wake me up when you get through.
- We'll take care of you, all right.
We take the tonsils last.
I think we work on the moustache first.
Give him a little snoop.
This side's too long.
Give him a little snoop this side.
Now this side is too short.
The other side is too long.
Snoop him up.
That's better, but the side that was too short now is too long... and the side that was too long is too short.
I think you got to give him one more snoop.
I think we better measure.
It's about a foot too much.
No, the measure's a foot too much.
Now it looks much better.
It can stand one more snoop in the middle, I think.
In the middle, one snoop.
I think it's a little bit rough right here.
You know, I'm never going on this boat again.
The food is no good. Of course, I no eat yet, but even if I don't eat, I like the food good.
One more snoop.
That's beautiful?
That's what you call a work of art.
Hey, you know, I think you give him one snoop too much.
And I want you to know, I'm fed up on your alibis.
You're getting all excited.
Now where do you think you're going?
I'm running this racket.
Just stay here and keep out of sight like I told you.
No you don't.
Now, listen to me, Mr. Alky Briggs.
You can't keep me cooped up like this.
I've played second fiddle on this ship long enough.
Now you listen. I'm not after any dames.
I'm after Joe Helton, I tell you, and he can't get away from me on this boat.
He's got to put his okay on my gang, or he's gonna get this.
I'm the tailor.
That reminds me.
You've got them on.
Pardon me while I step into the closet.
And get a load of this, if you come in again at 3:00 a.
M... - Stop bothering me.
Tell it to the tailor.
- Alky!
- You can't stay in that closet.
- I can't, can I?
That's what they said to Thomas Edison, mighty inventor... Thomas Lindbergh, mighty flier, and Thomas Shefsky, mighty like a rose.
Just remember that if there weren't any closets, there wouldn't be any hooks... and if there weren't any hooks, there'd be no fish, and that would suit me fine.
Don't try to hide. I know you're in that closet.
- Did you see me go in the closet?
- Am I in the closet now?
Then how do you know I was in the closet?
Your Honour, I rest my case.
Come here, brown eyes.
You're not gonna get me off this bed.
I didn't know you were a lawyer.
You're awfully shy for a lawyer.
You bet I'm shy. I'm a shyster lawyer.
Then what do you think of an egg that would give me...
You've been getting nothing but dirty breaks.
We can clean and tighten your brakes... but you'll have to stay in the garage all night.
I want excitement. I want to ha-cha-cha-cha.
You don't realise it.
From the time he got the marriage license, I've led a dog's life.
Are you sure he didn't get a dog's license?
Alky can't make a fool of me.
I want to go places. I want to do things.
I want freedom, I want liberty, I want justice!
Madam, you're making history.
In fact, you're making me.
And I wish you'd keep my hands to yourself.
I want life, I want laughter, I want gaiety.
I want to ha-cha-cha-cha.
Madam, before I get through with you, you will have a clear case for divorce... and so will my wife.
The first thing to do is to arrange for a settlement.
You take the children, your husband takes the house.
Junior burns the house, you take the insurance and I take you.
But I haven't any children.
That's the trouble with this country.
You haven't any children.
And as for me, I'm going back in the closet where men are empty overcoats.
Brown eyes.
Sir, this is an outrage, breaking into a man's home.
There'll be a letter about this in the Times tomorrow morning.
But you won't read it, 'cause I'm gonna lay you out pretty.
You're gonna lay me out pretty?
That's the thanks I get for freeing an innocent girl... who, although she is hiding at the moment... has promised to become the mother of her children.
And with that, sir, I bid you a fond farewell.
Come out of there. I want to talk to you.
I'm sorry, but we're using the old-fashioned iceman... and we find him very satisfactory for keeping the house warm.
Just as I thought, you're yellow, grabbing at a woman's skirts.
- I'm wise.
- You're wise?
What's the capital of Nebraska?
What's the capital of the Chase National Bank?
Now, I'll try you on an easy one.
How many Frenchmen can't be wrong?
- You were warm and so was she.
With a little study you'll go a long way.
- And I'd wish you'd start now.
- Do you see this gat?
Cute, isn't it?
Santa Claus bring it for Christmas?
I got a fire engine. Listen, mug. Do you know who I am?
Are you animal or vegetable?
- Get this. I'm Alky Briggs.
- And I'm the fellow who talks so much.
Fancy meeting you here after all these drinks.
- Wait a minute.
- Sorry, I can't stay.
The captain's waiting to chase me.
You can stay, all right, until I finish with you.
Alky, darling, please!
Don't "darling" me.
Get in that next room and stay there!
Get in that next room.
I'm not good enough for her, am I?
Is there anything you've got to say before I drill you?
- Yes, I'd like to ask you one question.
Do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?
Don't you think that although girls go out with boys like me... they always marry the other kind?
If you're gonna kill me, hurry up. I have to take my tonic at 2:00.
I can use a guy with your nerve.
I think we could get along well together.
Of course, the first year we might have our little squabbles.
But, then, that's inevitable, don't you think?
And what do you want here?
I've known him for years. He used to live in the next barrel to me.
The stowaways.
I can help you bozos.
- Mr. Bozos to you.
- All right, Mr. Bozo.
I'm shorthanded, and I want to get a guy on this boat.
It's too late to get him on now. Should've said so before we sailed.
Listen. This is a map of B Deck. There's Joe Helton's stateroom.
And he's a tough egg.
And you're coming with me... while I have it out with Joe.
Do you know who Joe Helton is?
I think I'll get off this boat until this blows over.
If you know what's good for you, you'll stick with me.
You keep the windows covered while I go in.
What is the idea of this?
I make a move for you.
- I'll call the captain!
- The captain don't play chess.
- Purser! - Steward!
- Too much noise here for us.
We better go someplace where it's quiet.
- Your cigars, sir.
Dad, now look at you.
You aren't even dressed yet.
You can do all the dressing for the family, Mary.
Old Joe Helton is taking things easy for the rest of his life.
We're big shots now, baby.
- Hello, Briggs.
I just wanted to have a friendly talk.
I'm sort of worried about business.
Step in the other room, baby.
- Run along, honey.
Your kid?
She's cute, isn't she?
I don't think we've got anything to talk about.
Not before I get your okay on my gang.
- I'm not doing you any favours.
You're gonna sign this.
I'm taking over your territory, or there's gonna be trouble.
I'm taking no sides.
You'll have to fight it out with Butch and the gang.
I'm stepping into your shoes as boss.
I'm not backing up any small-time chiseller.
Don't put on the Ritz with me.
Don't get cocky with me, Briggs.
I'm talking turkey.
You can't make all the dough and then run out on your pals.
I'm not taking orders from a mug like you!
Here's mine!
So you got your gang with you?
I'll get you later.
What are you doing in my room?
That's my partner, but he no speak.
He's dumb and deaf.
You guys don't know it, but you just scared a pretty tough egg out of this room.
Sure, we're a couple of tough guys.
- Do you want to make some money?
Money? Feel this muscle.
Feel his muscle.
How much you pay?
Just how tough are you?
You pay little bit, we're little bit tough.
You pay very much, very much tough.
You pay too much, we're too much tough.
- How much you pay?
- I pay plenty.
Then we're plenty tough.
And we show you, too.
Partner, show him how tough we are.
That's nothing.
That's free. Now we give you the real stuff this time.
Come on. Put some pep in it.
The one-two uppercut.
You know, on the button.
No downstairs button. Upstairs button.
That's good, all right.
I tell him you're tough, and you punch like a lily. What's a matter?
You wanna lose this job?
Give him the stuff this time.
He can do much better... but he no work good today.
He no get paid.
When he get paid, you watch him.
Come on. This time we give him the works.
On the button this time.
Come on, I tell you. On the button.
Give me the punch.
Come on! Punch!
That's enough.
- What do you think of us?
Not so loud. You want him to get a swell head?
You guys are plenty tough, all right.
I'm spying on you.
You're just the fellows I need.
- We're great, huh?
- You're great.
- My partner?
My grandfather's great. He's a great-grandfather.
When Helton comes out of his room, plug him.
- What'll we plug him with?
- Didn't I give you two gats?
We had to drown the gat, but we saved you a little black gitten.
Here, take these, and hang onto them now.
Don't leave me for a minute.
And keep your eye on that guy that just went out of here.
Anybody come near the boss, let him have it.
You're all right now, boss.
Anybody comes near you...
What's a matter with you?
Look out. That's all right. He was just practicing.
Now I can take a walk out on deck and feel safe. Come on. Let's go.
There he comes now.
Get him. Don't worry. We'll get him.
I've got my finger on the trigger.
Anybody comes near the boss, let him have it.
He's got a disguise.
Take off the whiskers. We know you.
Why didn't you get him?
Not afraid, are you?
Afraid?
A man who's licked his weight... in wild caterpillars?
Afraid? You bet I'm afraid.
How are things in the closet?
You know, I still smell of mothballs.
I don't want to talk to you.
So here you are, loafing around with these tramps.
I came down to see Joe Helton.
- Don't you think we'd better go?
- What? And leave this woman alone with her husband?
Suppose her sweetheart came in.
Alky Briggs, don't think you can keep me cooped up in that stateroom.
Because you're crazy!
You'll stay down there and keep out of my business.
- Keep out of my business.
You were going to show me a good time. A good time!
I might as well have stayed home and played solitaire!
I've more important things than you to worry about.
You say that again and I'll scratch your eyes out!
You take this gun.
You're gonna need it more than I will.
Just the man I wanna see. If I show you how to save 20%... would you be interested? Of course you would.
First, your overhead is too high and your brow is too low.
Interested already, aren't you?
Wait till I get through.
- Two fellows are trying to attack you... and two fellows are trying to defend you.
Now, that's 50% waste.
Why can't you be attacked by your bodyguards?
Your life will be saved, and that's 100% waste.
Now what have you got?
Me, and I'll attack you for nothing.
- I anticipated that.
How does an army travel?
On its stomach.
And you? On a ship.
Of course, you're saving your stomach.
- The same common sense...
- I don't think you realise...
I realise it's a penny here and there, but look at me.
I've worked myself up from nothing to extreme poverty.
- I'll tell you what I say...
- Then it's all settled.
I'm to be your new bodyguard.
In case I attack you... I'll be there to defend you, too.
When you want to be attacked, I'll defend you 10 minutes later.
I've already got two bodyguards, but I'll think it over.
- I've got a frog in my throat.
- A frog in my throat.
- You've got a frog in your throat.
You can't do that to my customers!
Say, what's the matter with you? Are you crazy or something?
Have your landing cards and passports ready, please.
- How do you do, Madame Swempski?
- Hello, boys. - Any statement for the press?
Nothing of interest on this tour.
Is it true the opera is on the decline in Central Europe?
I predict they're going to have the greatest year they've ever had.
Is it true that you're gonna get married again while on this tour?
- Gentlemen, I don't know what to say.
- Gentlemen, I'd say just this.
The bicycle will never replace the horse.
But, the horse will never replace the bicycle... which is quite a horse on the bicycle if I ever saw one, and I never did.
I dare you to print that, you muckrakers.
- Have a cigar, babe.
- Okay for the picture, Joe.
Here's a little sex stuff for your front page.
Now, hold it steady, please.
You can say it was a real love match.
We married for money.
Eh, my shrinking violet?
It won't hurt you to shrink 30 or 40 pounds.
You impudent cad!
- I'll report you to your paper.
- Let me do the reporting.
Is it true you'll get a divorce as soon as your husband recovers his sight?
Is it true you wash your hair in clam broth?
- Is it true you danced in a flea circus?
- This is outrageous!
- If you don't stop, I'll call the captain.
- So that's it.
Infatuated with a pretty uniform.
We don't count. We gave you our best years, now you want an officer.
I don't like this innuendo.
That's what I always say, love flies out the door when money comes innuendo.
It's nice to have seen you, but I've got nobody to blame but myself.
- Could you tell me...
You're awfully glum.
I was just thinking, after the boat lands, I may never see you again.
Does it matter to you whether you ever see me again?
I can't think of anything in the world that matters more.
Mary, I'll never leave you.
Tag.
I'm just trying to sneak off the boat, that's all.
I'm looking for the man who owns...
Wait a minute.
I don't like to speak about it, Officer, but I happen to be... a good friend of the meat supplier to this boat.
- Well, do you like lamb chops?
- Yes, what of it?
- This man doesn't handle lamb chops.
But the roast beef is very good today.
You fellows can't get off the boat without showing passports.
Get on back there at the end of the line and get your passports open.
Go on. Get back there.
Stuffed shirt.
When he said that to me... you could've knocked me over with a feather.
He gives you service.
It looks like we're up against it.
It's up to you to get us a passport.
I got you, didn't I?
Well, you'll have to get up pretty early in the morning to steal from me.
He did get up early this morning, but you weren't here.
Well, come on. Let's try another one.
What's the idea, putting your hand in my pocket?
Just a little mistake.
I had a suit that looked just like that and I thought those were my pants.
How could they be yours, when I've got them on?
This suit had two pairs of pants.
Better keep your hands to yourself.
Do you know who's on this boat? Maurice Chevalier, the movie actor.
- I just ran into him.
- Did you hurt him?
- How do you know it was Chevalier?
- I got his passport right there.
Now he can't get off the boat.
Hey, he looks like Chevalier.
And I can look like Chevalier.
- I certainly look like Chevalier.
- But that's not enough.
You have to sing his song to get off this boat.
If a nightingale could sing like you
They'd sing much better than you do
Dandy. Sing like that, they'll throw us all off the boat.
- Well, let's try it.
- All right. Come on.
Have your passports ready.
Straight out... you'll find the baggage on the deck.
Keep in line, everybody. 945.
Keep in line, everybody.
1092.
Hey, if you want to get off the boat...
- get in the back.
- Oh, I didn't get on in the back.
- I got on in the front.
- You're right...
- I told them to stay in line. - Yeah?
Show me your passport.
- Yeah, right here.
That's my name. - Maurice Chevalier?
- This picture doesn't look like you.
- Sure, I'm Maurice Chevalier.
I'll sing for you.
If a nightingale could sing like you
They'd sing much better than they do
Here, never mind that.
Get back in line where you belong.
I was ahead of you!
Let me have your passport.
This picture doesn't look like you.
It don't look like me from the front, but go in the back of the boat, just like me.
You're not Maurice Chevalier.
- Are you Maurice Chevalier?
- No. Well, there you are. Wait.
I prove it. If a nightingale could sing like you He sing much better than you do and
- No push me!
Get back in line where you belong.
- It doesn't look like you either.
- This man has no moustache.
- The barbershop wasn't open.
- Why, look at that face.
- Well, look at that face.
Hey, are you going to identify yourself, or else...
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me
Out! Back in line where you belong!
Get off there!
- Get off the table!
- What do you think this is here?
- Put that down!
- Lunatic!
- You want to break that?
Here, let it alone!
Passport. I said passport, not pasteboard.
Come on with that passport!
Not washboard!
Chevalier?
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me
And if the sandman brought me dreams of you
I'd want to dream my whole life through
Get him out of here!
- Put him back there where he belongs!
- Take it easy, folks.
The gangplank is to the left, please.
Don't crowd. Don't crowd.
- Take your time.
Ladies first. - Let me off the boat. I'm a sick man.
- I feel faint.
- I don't care, take your time.
I tell you, I feel faint. I'm going to faint.
- Someone get a doctor!
- Somebody fainted.
Where's a doctor? A doctor! I want a doctor!
Look, she's got a chill, cover her up.
No, get off.
No purse, put it back. Pulse.
I think you best take her temperature.
That's good, we'll take care of you, lady.
You fools, I'm not the patient.
We're not the doctor. Come on.
Doctor! Is there a doctor on the boat?
- Sure, I'm a doctor.
- A man fainted over here.
- Man fainted? I'll soon fix him.
Just my hard luck it couldn't be a woman.
Here's the doctor.
Just as I thought, smoking too much.
Here he is here, Doctor.
Don't tell me. I'll find him myself.
I can't do anything for that man.
What he needs is an ocean voyage.
In the meantime, get him off the boat and have his baggage examined.
Gangway!
You all get close so he won't recover.
Step right around here.
Step lively down there.
Back that ambulance in here!
Helton's throwing his party tonight, and this time we blow the works.
Now, you guys are going in as musicians.
And stay that way until I give you the office.
Say, what about those four guys in the house?
The ones you said were on the boat.
Don't worry about them.
They eat out of my hand.
The thing for you to worry about is that girl.
Keep your eye on her. Get me?
That ought be easy to take.
Sit tight and I'll give you a call.
Have you guys got an invitation?
We give you invitation of Chevalier.
When the nightingale sings like you
Cut it out!
And stay away from this door, see?
You certainly had me worried.
I thought you'd forgotten your own party.
You haven't been doing all the worrying.
My, but, there are a lot of strange-looking people here.
Ladies and gentlemen! Quiet, everybody.
A lady's diamond earring has been lost.
It looks exactly like this.
In fact, this is it.
How about you and I passing out on the veranda?
Or would you rather pass out here?
Sir, you have the advantage of me.
Not yet, but wait till I get you outside.
You're pretty fresh, aren't you?
That's my wife and I don't like the way you're acting here.
If you don't like our country, go back where you came from.
I should sink that right in your scalp.
- Run for your life! The Indians are coming!
Put your scalp in your pocket. Here.
The Indians.
Have a good time, kid.
This is going to be a real party.
Is this a party?
The beer is warm, the women are cold... and I'm hot under the collar.
In fact, a more poisonous little barbecue I've never attended.
You're a funny kind of a duck, but I like you.
You stuck by me, and I'll stick by you.
Sheriff, I ain't much on flowery sentiments... but there's something I just got to tell you.
Sheriff, I ain't forgetting.
Whoa, there, Bossie.
My friends, this is indeed a surprise.
You couldn't have pleased me better.
I want you to meet the sweetest little thing in the whole wide world.
No, it's special for Mr. Helton, sir.
Come back in a half hour, and I'll give you another look at it.
Keep your eye on Helton.
We're gonna grab his daughter and take her to the old barn.
Old barn?
A fine tinhorn sport you are.
With all the good shows in town, taking a girl to an old barn!
Once we get a hold of that girl, he'll take orders from me.
- I'll show him...
- Enough small talk.
- Where's your wife, Lucille?
- Would you...
Be back next Thursday, and bring a specimen of your handwriting.
And, above all, don't worry.
It's midsummer madness.
The music is in my temples... the hot blood of youth.
Come, Kapellmeister. Let the violas throb.
My regiment leaves at dawn.
I guess my regiment can go without me.
No, don't, my husband might be inside.
If he finds me out here, he'll wallop me.
Always thinking of your husband.
Couldn't I wallop you just as well?
I heard Alky talking about this party.
I've dreamed of a night like this, I tell you.
You tell me about some of your dreams.
I can't even sleep anymore, wondering who he's chasing around with.
Why can't we break away from all this, just you and I... and lodge with my fleas in the hills?
I mean, flee to my lodge in the hills.
No, I couldn't think of it.
Don't be afraid. You can join this lodge for a few pennies.
You won't even have to take a physical examination... unless you insist on one.
What a swell home life I've got.
Why, I think I'd almost marry you to spite that double-crossing crook.
Mrs. Briggs... I've known and respected your husband Alky for many years... and what's good enough for him is good enough for me.
Henry, carefully, somebody may see us.
I've been careful too long.
Now that you've brought it up, how long have you been careful?
- They saw us!
- Be calm, Emily. I'll talk to them.
You won't say anything about this?
Sir, are you trying to offer me a bribe?
You see, I'm not happy with my husband.
He should've married some little housewife.
Madam, I resent that.
Some of my best friends are housewives.
Now, see here, if you're going to...
You're living in a fool's paradise.
You intend to spend $10 to buy this woman a ring?
It's solid brass and $1.50 takes it away.
I know it'll fit her.
I got it from the nose of a savage.
$1.50.
You can have it for $1.
Fifty cents and not a nickel under.
Now, my friends, what am I offered for this fine French piece of bric-a-brac?
I know what it is to be unhappy.
How do you think I feel?
I'm stuck with this ring.
I've been married for four years, four years of neglect... four years of battling, four years of heartbreaks.
That makes 12 years.
You must've been married in rompers.
Mighty pretty country around there.
Do you think you'll ever go back?
Come here, babe.
I like you. I shouldn't.
Maybe we can get a girl for him.
Married to her 12 years and you ask me?
I told you to spy on Helton.
- I did spy on him.
- He was spying on me.
No. I was too foxy for him.
All he could do was spy on me.
Well, get back in there.
We're all set to cop his girl.
Okay, chief.
They got some good stuff outside.
You want a drink?
Beat you that time.
- Very swell.
Let me get you some punch.
- I'd love it.
Well, how's it coming, kid?
- Got everything you want?
- Sure, how about a job for my grandfather?
Your grandfather, what does he do?
He puts cheese in the mousetraps.
Why, we haven't got any mice here.
He brings his own mice with him.
You know, Mary, everyone seems to be having nearly as much fun as I am.
I beg your pardon, but there's someone to see you, Miss Helton.
- Pardon me, and I'll hurry right back.
No, you're wrong, girls, you're wrong.
In the first place, Gary Cooper is much taller than I am.
I wish you'd announce this singer. I can't make out the name.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to announce... that the buffet will be served in the next room in five minutes.
To get you in that room quickly...
Mrs. Schmalhausen will sing a soprano solo in this room.
You wanna get thrown out again?
Play something nice.
I tell you what you play.
Play...
That's magnifico.
Mary! They've kidnapped her!
Who's been kidnapped?
Mary, my daughter!
But who could've done it?
It's that Alky Briggs!
You saw them drag her into the car.
First, they blindfolded me and then they...
Of course, they took her to the barn.
Fellows, let's all pack up a lunch and go down to the old barn.
Fred, you go down to the North Road.
Jack, you head down by Front Street.
I'll go pick up a couple of the boys.
And I'll take care of picking up a couple of dames.
This is no time for women.
On to the barn!
Gee, I wish I had a horse.
Hurry it up, boys.
No use yelling, kid.
Nobody will hear you in here.
You wait till my father hears about this!
He's gonna hear about it because I'm gonna tell him myself.
Don't get all excited.
Come on. You take your hands off of me!
Listen, kid. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
You'll be out in an hour if your dad comes through.
Butch, you take care of the girl while I telephone Joe.
You take your hands off of me!
Now, make yourself at home, but shut up!
- $1.10.
- Here's $1.
- But I said $1.10.
- Give me $1.
I'll keep the change.
That's a half a dollar I owe you.
You call this a barn?
This looks like a stable.
It looks like a barn but smells like a stable.
Well, let's just look at it.
Have you got a girl in that hayloft?
You're a bigger fool than I thought.
Beat it, I tell you!
- I said beat it!
He said beat it.
Gee, I wish I'd said that.
Everybody's repeating it.
I'm coming down there and get you!
Don't bother. We'll come right up.
Come on. I'm going in to get him.
Here we are at the old barn, all set for a nice picnic lunch.
Gosh, the picnic is off, we haven't got any red ants.
I know an Indian who's got a couple of Red aunts.
Don't you think we'd better go look for the girl?
Let's wait till we eat, there's hardly enough lunch for two.
I don't see why she couldn't get kidnapped near a restaurant.
Some dark night, I think I'll come and lay for you if the hens don't get sore.
Go over to that filling station and get some milk.
Grade-A.
Well, come on. Where's the milk?
There's a customer ahead of me.
What about you, kidnapping a girl?
Old-fashioned piece of melodrama... kidnapping a girl!
You've been reading too many dime novels.
Go on. You get him. I'll wait for you outside.
Keep out of this loft!
It's better to have loft and lost than never to have loft at all.
- Nice work.
- Beat it, or I'll throw you out!
- Take your face out of my foot!
- I gotcha!
So, thought we were afraid? Thought we were afraid, did you?
Now I'm gonna give it to you guys right!
You, get out of that loft!
Butch, what happened?
Come up here, Butch.
Where's all those farmers' daughters I've been hearing about for years?
Why don't you boys fight over there? You want to break my glasses?
Come on, folks. Step right up.
Only 10 cents a chance. Attaboy!
Here you are.
Ten cents gets you in the only game in the stable.
Let's see.
Number 16 wins. And the lucky number.
There you are, young man.
Sorry you didn't get a better one.
Here we go! Let's see what comes up.
Well, if he isn't the lucky guy.
Double 0.
Two shots for the price of one.
Folks, this is the best game in all...
You're a mother, you understand.
How would you like to have somebody... steal one of your heifers?
I know, heifer cow is better than none... but this is no time for puns.
Get in that battle over there.
Here we are again at the ringside, and it looks like a great battle.
Now the boys are locked in the centre of the ring.
What a grudge fight. Zowie!
Zowie! Zowie!
That makes three zowies, and a man gets a base on balls.
Ending of the first inning.
No runs, no errors, but plenty of hits.
This program comes to you courtesy of the Golden Goose Furniture Company... with three stores: 125th Street, 125th Street and 125th Street.
You furnish the girl, we tar and feather your nest.
Look for our advertisement in today's ash can.
Now the boys are at it in the centre of the ring!
Oh! That one hurt!
Come on, you palookas! Stop stalling!
Oh, mama, if I only had my youth again.
Both boys are fiddling in the ring, and I don't think much of the tune.
Briggs is bobbing and weaving.
It's nice work if you can get it.
Now they're trying. Very trying.
I copped that one from an almanac.
Now they're in the centre of the ring, and the crowd hurrahs.
Are you all right, honey?
Remember, old Joe Helton never forgot a friend.
This is one job that certainly was a pleasure.
- What are you doing?
Haven't we been announced?
I am Fräulein von Kesten.
Please, don't get up, Your Excellency
I'll take a seat too.
I am afraid to say that the Headmistress is indisposed at present
I'm so sorry
She regrets very much not being able to welcome you herself
Please, tell the Headmistress that I also regret it very much
I wanted to introduce our little niece myself
Manuela, make a curtsey
– Well, you're pretty big for fourteen.
– Fourteen and a half
How is her education progressing?
Her education so far could have been better
She's almost an orphan
My brother-in-law is certainly a good man
But you know what army officers are like
They don't understand about educating young girls
Unfortunately, my poor sister died too soon
She's overly sensitive and a bit of a scatterbrain.
– There, there, now There's no harm in a few tears. You'll get over it
Manuela, pull yourself together
An officer's daughter crying!
You can't go up there
– Why not?
– Come down.
It's forbidden
I am Margo von Rasso. I'm to look after you
So, Manuela...
Chin up now. Make your father proud of you
Work hard and do as you're told. I want you to get good results Don't spoil my plans for your future
– Do you promise?
– Of course, Aunt
Give me a kiss then
Adieu, Fräulein von Kesten.
– Goodbye, Your Excellency
Thank you for everything you will do for the child
Do well, Manuela
This way
The main stairs are only for the Headmistress and guests
First, we'll get your uniform.
The wardrobe mistress is expecting you
It's on the fourth floor.
I'll show you the ropes
But you must do things for me too.
– Yes, Marga
In the morning you'll bring me water for washing
That's just the under class
"And everyone shouts as loud as they can:
"When do we eat?"
"And everyone shouts as loud as they can:
"When do we eat?"
I'm hungry as a hunter
That's the new girl
– I'm Oda von Oldensleben.
– I'm Barbara von Beckendorf
I'm Ilse von Treischke.
Do you know what dormitory you're in?
Marga says I'm in Fräulein von Bernburg's
So am I. Be careful you don't fall in love
Because all the girls have a crush on Fräulein von Bernburg
God! I can't bear to listen to it
"Ilse, how I envy you!
You're in her dormitory
"Oh God, oh God
"Tell me, is it true that she kisses you at night?"
I've had lots of weird governesses
I didn't pay attention to them.
– It's funny with her
You never know how to take her
One minute she looks at you terribly Then, all of a sudden, she's very kind
She's really strange, that Bernburg
Ilse, you shouldn't call her just Bernburg
Ah, be glad I don't call her the Golden One
Manuela, where have you been?
Come with me
Nice girl, isn't she?
Come in here. Come here
So you're No. 124.
Come on, get undressed
– What are you doing with my dress?
– Keep quiet, little one
In five weeks, if you behave, you'll have a day out
Then you'll get your clothes back.
Now come over here
Come here, sit on this chair
Now for your hair
Oh please, don't do that
It is the rules.
The hair must be plaited tightly
– It hurts.
– You will get used to it
– Oh, those hairpins!
– It's the rules, too.
Soon you won't notice it
Come with me.
We'll put on your dress
It is too long.
We have to pin it up
– Someone's worn this before.
– Of course, what do you think?
A new dress for each girl wouldn't be economical says Fräulein von Kesten.
No, no, we are not that generous
When a girl leaves, her dress is handed on until it's worn out
Look, what does this mean?
A heart and the letters "E. v. B."
This means Elisabeth von Bernburg
The girl who wore that dress before must have been infatuated with Fräulein von Bernburg
So, you are the new girl?
Show me how you look
Now turn around
Your hair needs to be tidier
Why are you shivering?
Are you nervous?
That's good
Manuela, I demand total discipline
You must notify me before leaving the dormitory
Talking while dressing and undressing is strictly forbidden
Is that clear?
You may go to the others
This is your cupboard.
The key's there, open it
They are forbidden.
You must give them to me
– Have you any money?
– Some
– Why's that?
– It's not allowed.
They keep it for you
Come over here
Grand, eh?
Mia stuck up a picture of Henny Porten
But I've got Hans Albers
And he's got a lot of...
What's it called?
What do they call what all the movie stars have?
Sex appeal?
Yes, he's got that
– Chocolate?
Have to give it up.
– But I... – No buts.
Rules are rules.
– Heavens, Marga, don't be like that!
It's nothing to do with you.
I'm in charge of the new girl
My name's Edelgard
Can I help you?
Yes, please
What's that book?
– I was going to read it on the journey
It's from my Uncle's library. I haven't read it yet
Wow!
This is great
– You must give it to me.
– No, I must not
It's my book!
– What's all this? Marga!
– Yes, Fräulein von Kesten
– Something forbidden?
– Yes, Fräulein von Kesten
Take these things away
Meinhardis, come here
I keep my good and bad marks in here
If anything forbidden is found in your cupboard, you get a black mark
If you get more than five black marks in four weeks, you're not allowed out
So... watch out
Dismissed!
Here are the bills, Headmistress
Headmistress, please
You must reduce expenses.
They are too high
Yes, Headmistress.
We do our best
The children are already complaining of hunger
Hunger?
We Prussians know how to hunger.
They are children of soldiers
And God willing, mothers of soldiers too
What they need is discipline, not a life of luxury
– How true, Headmistress, how true.
– Poverty is no sin
It enobles.
Let the others gorge themselves. They'll be sorry
What I like best is stuffed roast hare
Our cook makes a big coffee cake with a crumble topping this thick
Eclairs with whipped cream are even better
Through discipline and hunger, hunger and discipline we shall be great again.
Or not at all!
My Mother wrote that they've been slaughtering on the farm
Oh, why can't she send me a ham?
Nobody must have more than anyone else
But if she just sent a whole ham? Some girls' parents aren't well off any more
I'd give them some
I wouldn't eat it all myself
Why scrape so much butter off?
Don't blame me, there's only half a pound for fifty girls
The girls are as meek as lambs
They daren't complain about anything
Everything is discipline and order here
Line up!
Hurry up
The little Meinhardis, Headmistress
Well, well
Get ready for the prayers.
March forward!
Closer!
Forward!
Closer
We'll sing the first verse of the hymn "So take my hand"
"So take my hand
"And lead me on
"To my joyful end
"For all eternity
"I wish not to walk alone
"A single step of the way
"Where You will both go and stay
"I'll be by Your side"
I have something further to say
It has reached my ears that certain rules are being disobeyed
Letters are being sent without prior approval with unfounded complaints about the school
Staff will report any further incidents to me
The first culprit will be severely punished
Days out will be cancelled and wearing uniform forbidden
Own clothes will have to be worn when walking through town
Just imagine her naked
You have been warned
I wouldn't send my children to a boarding school
– I'd have to think about it
That's the infantry
That's the cavalry
Girls, come here a minute
Look, what Marie can do
Come here, Marie.
Come on, Marie. – Leave me alone.
You're always laughing at me
No, no.
Just take a deep breath
What a body!
What's all this noise?
Edelgard!
What are you doing?
We were talking of Manuela's mother
She died a long time ago.
Manuela told me about her
Go and wash
You have no mother?
Otherwise I wouldn't be here
Come now.
Is that so terrible?
Don't tell yourself it's awful here
It's still strange to you You don't know the other girls yet
But you mustn't think you'll always be unhappy
Listen to me. You must tell yourself that you'll be very happy here
Pray to God every night and ask Him to help you
Will you promise me?
See what a reasonable girl you are
Now go to bed.
I'll come back to say goodnight
"It has reached my ears... "...that certain rules are being disobeyed"
"You have been warned"
Everybody to bed
– Well, are you all ready?
– Yes, Fräulein von Bernburg
Gives each one a smacker
Watch, Manuela.
It's my turn next
Step, step, step!
Hey, Josi Bleicher has a crush on me.
"Dearest, sweetest Mia...
"Let me be with you and sit near you at table
"From your loving, little Josi"
What's that note?
Show me
Hurry up. I'm waiting
I'm not interested in your silly games
Throw it in the basket and remember, once and for all:
writing notes is strictly forbidden.
– Thank you!
That was awfully nice of Fräulein von Bernburg
She is always so decent
I try to be a friend to the children
– On equal terms?
– Why not?
How do you maintain authority?
You are their superior and must keep your distance
We must awaken the children's ambition
Excellent, Fräulein von Attems
Affinity has no place here
That might lead to emotionalism
Always love!
Discipline is the main thing
The German classics must be cultivated
Fräulein von Bernburg, I have noticed that you give very few black marks
I've no need to punish the children, they obey me and learn well
Indeed! And Manuela von Meinhardis?
Yes... she doesn't do well.
But that will change
I find her charming.
And she does her work superbly
Oh, Manuela is so ladylike.
She learns excellently with me
She prepares my lessons better than the other girls
So far, although I say it myself the results of my teaching have always been good
Yes, exceptionally good
Ladies, please!
Yes, we know that. And we appreciate it
But please, do not try to exceed your duties
Certainly not
But the children must trust us
Sit down
"Jacob was in a strange land with his father-in-law Laban... "... and wanted to return to Canaan with his wives Rachel and Lea and his children"
Who wants to tell the story?
"Jacob lifted up his eyes and behold, Esau came"
He was his brother. "Of his many wives... "... the most beautiful one was Rachel, and with little Joseph and Benjamin...
"... he put her behind him." – Why behind him?
Because he was afraid.
He'd given Esau some red pottage and feared he might still be angry
"And the sheep he put in front
"Esau approached and warmly embraced him
"Then Jacob rejoiced"
That's very nice.
Be seated
How is our work for today?
Edelgard, first verse
"Oh, that I had a thousand tongues and a thousand mouths
"Then would I use them all to sing from the depths of my heart
"Praises for all eternity
"Of what God has done for me"
Well done, sit down
Manuela, second verse
"Oh, that my voice would carry...
"to...
Unprepared again
Edelgard, this is too terrible
I really learned it well, but in front of Fräulein von Bernburg I forget everyting
Fräulein von Bernburg wants to see you
I wonder why?
I feel sorry for Fräulein Manuela
Sorry for her?
Why, may I ask?
She cries a lot at night.
Her pillow is always wet through
Of course not
She must be homesick
I won't be able to say a thing.
I feel faint
Ah, never mind
Come here
Look at this
Tell me, haven't you any new clothes?
Where were you before you came here?
– At my aunt's
At your aunt's?
Full of holes
My aunt thought it would do
That it won't do
I agree, it won't do
Perhaps we can find a new petticoat somewhere
It may be a bit long, but we can take it up
For me?
Too good for me.
– Silly child
What an emotional girl you are
Come
Have a good cry.
I'm not unhappy at all
Are you homesick?
Homesick? No.
I just feel like crying sometimes
And you don't know why?
Or is it something you can't trust me with?
I can trust you with everything, but it's hard to say
I'd really like to know
When you say goodnight and leave, and shut the door to your room I stare at the door in the darkness
I want to get up and come to you but I know that I can't
And I think of when I get older and have to leave the school and every night you will kiss other girls
– What thoughts you have!
– I love you so much!
But you're always so distant.
I can't ever go to your room and talk to you or hold your hands...
– Well, child, control yourself
Don't be a little girl. Be a good comrade
You know I can't make exceptions Or the other girls will be jealous
I think of you often, Manuela
Oh, I am so glad!
– Now, you won't cry anymore?
– No, no more
Well, there you are
What is it now?
May I ask you something?
You can't imagine how wonderful it is to live for you children
Now just run downstairs to the others. And take your washing with you
Girls, another boring Sunday!
My mother says I mustn't be weak
"The Fatherland needs people of steel"
My mother spent four years here, too
Has she forgotten how awful it is?
How deep it is!
Come here, Marga.
– What are you doing?
How deep is this hole?
Silly, you can test it by the law of gravity
– How do you do it?
– You count the seconds it takes to reach the bottom, then add the acceleration of gravity – 9.81
Great!
I'll try with a firework.
– No, don't!
You'll only make a noise
Watch, girls!
Listen to this
"Dear Parents, today is another horrid Sunday
"Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days?
"Please, send me something to eat
"Your loving daughter, Ilse"
If the Headmistress got hold of that!
But she won't. I'm going to smuggle it out
Well, children...
Isn't it a nice Sunday?
– Yes, very nice
Doing good work?
Show me
Very nice.
Also good
Show me your stockings, Marie
Also very good
Show me your stocking
You'll get a good mark for it
Goodbye, children.
– Goodbye, Fräulein von Kesten
Please, smuggle this letter out.
Don't get caught
Don't worry, Fräulein Ilse
I'll make sure no one sees
Thank you very much, Johanna!
Goodbye
"To celebrate the birthday of our distinguished Headmistress"
"Hold, o Queen!
"Long was I sunk in a delusive dream
"I loved, but now I am at last awake"
Oh Manuela, you look so handsome!
Do you think she will like me?
She must like me.
– Of course
Just watch. Today I certainly won't forget my lines!
"Long was I sunk in a delusive dream
"All alone, Madam?" "Madman!"
"With none of your ladies-in-waiting?"
"To what rude boldness my indulgence leads!"
"Our pleasant sojourn in Aranjuez Is over now...
"...and yet your highness quits / These joyous scenes no happier than before"
Elise, where is my beard?
Quiet, now comes our scene
"Cannot some letters be discovered?"
"Truly, an intercepted letter from the prince...
"...would work with rare effect"
This letter came back because it was wrongly addressed
Ilse von Westhagen
"By Heaven!
I'm all amazement.
Compass this
"And I'll bow down to thee, Dominican!"
"Soft!
Some one comes
"'Tis she – 'tis she herself!"
"Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days?"
Charming words!
Now listen to me
Children who lie and smuggle letters cannot be in plays.
Take your costume off!
I can't be in the play?
Fortunately, the letter was wrongly addressed
Your parents have been spared the anguish of an ungrateful child
Leave me alone
Stop dreaming!
"And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne"
No, child.
How often do I have to tell you? Don't just speak.
Declaim!
"And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne"
Oh go. You have no talent, child. Next, please!
Posa!
Repeat the sentence you always stumble on
I know it very well!
Good grief, child! "One pen-stroke now, one motion of your hand..."
"One pen-stroke now, one motion of your hand..."
On your knees! Arms open!
– I thought...
– Don't think, obey!
"Grant us liberty of thought," Fräulein von Attems!
Of course...
Little Eboli, come
Repeat your sentences
"O Carlos, how cruelly you play with me"
Here you must bring into play the whole art of feminine seduction
Just listen to me.
She looks at him and says
"O Carlos, how cruelly you play with me"
Excuse me, Fräulein von Attems, but it's about to start
– Good evening, children.
– Good evening, Headmistress
Be seated
I will not leave you here, Hans
Because of internal difficulties the role of Domingo will be read by Liese von Zieritz
"Our pleasant sojourn in Aranjuez Is over now...
You've got yourself in a fine mess!
Come, it's not that bad
I'm not in the play either
Wash your face and come downstairs
She's so adorable!
"At length 'tis come – the happy moment's come
"Carlos may touch this all-beloved hand"
"I hear a step.
What boldness!
"Arise!"
"I will not rise.
Here will I kneel forever
"Here will I lie enchanted at your feet And grow to the dear ground you tread on"
"Madman!
To what rude boldness my indulgence leads!
"Know you, it is the Queen, your mother
"Whom you address in such presumptuous strain?"
"And know that I must die! "Let them come here, and drag me to the scaffold!
"A moment spent in paradise like this Is not too clearly purchased by a life"
"But then your Queen?"
"God...
"God!
"I'll go
"I will leave you"
Hurry with the lemon
Have a taste
What a fine punch you've brewed!
– It's a real punch.
– It'll make them tipsy!
Know what the Head said?
"She has pretty legs, pretty legs"
– What did Fräulein von Bernburg say?
– It was strange
Bernburg didn't say a single word
But she watched you
You can't imagine how closely she watched you
Now be quiet a moment, children
I was quite satisfied with you
Manuela, you were very good.
Just remember for the next time:
better declaiming and less emotion
Manuela, I want to tell you
You are very talented
If you work hard, you could be a very good actress
I'm very glad of that, Manuela
The children really performed well
It's very good exercise for the girls to learn to recite Schiller
Nothing is better than the German classics
We're grateful to you, Headmistress
The children are so lucky to be here in your charge, Headmistress
We do our best with the little we have
Your Majesties, Your Highnesses Your Excellencies and so on
I am happy that you managed without my assistance to win the applause of the staff and their guests
I wish to congratulate you
Your helmets, swords and boots were polished to perfection
And everything else went well too
But it could have been tighter, tighter, tighter!
Still, you played your parts well
Especially our Don Carlos
To your health, Manuela!
It tastes vile
You Rhine maiden!
That punch you brewed is really something
Look, I like this stuff
I'm quite tipsy
All right.
I'll play "Patern"
Let them enjoy themselves today
Yes, it's good for them to let their hair down
Fräulein von Kesten, keep an eye on them
I was somewhat surprised.
Schiller sometimes writes very freely
– I'm so happy!
– Your hurt me
"E. v. B."?
I want to make a speech
I love you all!
Want to know something?
She gave me a present.
A petticoat.
I've got it on – A petticoat?
She opened her cupboard and gave me a petticoat
I should wear it and think of her
No, she didn't actually say that
But that's what she must have meant.
Now I know for sure – she loves me!
– Who?
Fräulein von Bernburg
She is there
Yes, everyone should know about it!
Long live Fräulein von Bernburg, beloved by all!
Has she gone mad?
Long may she live!
Scandalous!
It was awful to see poor Manuela so drunk
You have to drink sometimes From sorrow or worry
I understand it very well
If it was up to me, I'd expel her immediately
Such a child doesn't deserve to be here.
– You are quite right
I agree.
Her place is in... – A reform school!
– Quite
Edelgard, have you seen Manuela?
– No, I'm not allowed in
No one is.
– I don't understand anything at all
I would advise you to be more careful
Please, no good advise.
I'm tired of being careful
Ma ch? re, you're not going to jeopardise your prospects because of this child? – Perhaps I am
– My God, but why?
– Because I can't stand injustice
Hanni, I feel peculiar
I can't think straight And my head really hurts
Hanni, how did I get here?
You were well and truly drunk
It was quite a spectacle
The disgrace!
This establishment has never seen such a scandal
You are the worst child the school has ever had
If you were younger, you'd be spanked
Look at me! Look at me, I said!
It's hardly creditable
You behaved like a street urchin
You have brought shame to the school
Where is the Headmistress?
Those who behave like you should be cursed
Your punishment will be decided later
You are well aware of what you did to Fräulein von Bernburg
She'll never forgive you
There was a phone call for you
Her Highness is visiting us this afternoon
Manuela must be there.
We must be at full strength
But she may not speak to the others
Hurry with the arrangements.
Her Highness is always punctual
Yes, Headmistress
Always punctual. Of course
The Head says Manuela should be cursed!
– My God, poor Manuela.
– She shouldn't have behaved like that
– Marga, you're always mean to her.
– Shut up!
Did you hear the Head ranting and raving?
Have you heard about Manuela?
– It's mean!
What's the matter?
Why are you staring at me like that?
I have something to say before the Princess arrives
A sorry and unprecedented case of insubordination has occurred
The Headmistress wished to save you from contact with the culprit But because of the visit an exception is being made Manuela von Meinhardis is coming out of the sickroom
The Headmistress puts you on your honour not to associate with her
Whoever speaks to her will be punished. Do you understand?
The Headmistress asked me to tell you not to speak to Manuela
The child must be isolated.
– Really?
A boycott?
That's never happened before
I'll speak to her!
Don't... Manuela will get the blame
We should tell the Princess
That won't help matters
She's important.
What she says, they do
I'll tell her.
I don't care!
Where is Manuela?
Hurry up!
Stand still!
Her Highness has arrived
Good afternoon, Fräulein von G?
rschner. How are you?
– Thank you, very well
Good afternoon, Fräulein von Attems.
Ah, Fräulein von Bernburg
– Very well, thank you
– Mademoiselle Oeuillet.
Comment allez-vous?
– Merci bien, Your Highness
This is our new English teacher, Miss Evans
– Miss Evans, how are you?
– Thank you, very well, Your Highness
I'm going upstairs to see the presentation
Royalty is always beautiful to see
– Don't forget to tell her.
– I intend to
You must tell her now
Yes, child?
What a lovely sight – so many happy children
Without a doubt, Your Highness
Beckendorf...
– Yes, my dear. I didn't forget
Dear Headmistress, I'd like to see the little Beckendorf
Fräulein Beckendorf, do you like it here?
Yes, of course, you do
Meinhardis. – Yes, what is her name?
– Meinhardis
Oh yes, right.
Dear Headmistress, the little Meinhardis girl
She was a very devout woman
I hope you'll try to be like her. You look very pale
I hope she's not ill, dear Headmistress?
– No, not at all, Your Highness
What a charming girl
She will be the pride of the school
Dear Headmistress, I'd like to speak to you about the nursery school
– This way please, Your Highness.
– Goodbye, my ladies
Goodbye, children
Such a big mouth, and then you said nothing
Well, if the Head hadn't been there... – It's just ridiculous!
– That wasn't the reason. You are a coward
Rubbish!
I'm too well brought up
If it were not for her Highness' visit I would have expelled Manuela this very day
Excuse me, Headmistress, but I see it differently
I know Manuela and the others better than you
I'm close to the children. I love them And give them my petticoats?
Manuela was poorly supplied
If a girl hasn't enough clothes, we write to her mother
The girl has no mother
Come in here
Such disobedience!
I wouldn't have expected you to disregard the Headmistress' orders so blatantly
But...
I'm so worried about Manuela!
She is so strange
Listen to me, Edelgard
Your friend isn't worth risking so much for
Associating with her only harms you I'm sure your parents would be very upset to know what a girl you are friends with
Manuela is not bad!
What you call sin, Headmistress I call the great spirit of love which takes a thousand forms
At this age young girls need someone to lean on
I will speak to Manuela and rid her of her exalted ideas
Exalted ideas? Fräulein von Bernburg, don't you see that the contact between you and Manuela must be dissolved?
I forbid you to speak another word with Manuela
– What is it?
– I'm so sorry...
You should be sober by now
Dear Fräulein von Bernburg...
Please, no theatrics
Go to my room and wait for me
– Did you see how pale Manuela was?
– Yes. Terrible
When she curtsied I thought she'd faint
Child!
What is all this crying for?
Pull yourself together
Don't be so feeble.
Come, sit here
Be reasonable now, will you?
What you have done you know
What you have done to me, you know that too
We needn't mention it again
You're to be punished
You'll be locked away
Not like prison... just isolated
Manuela, don't be unfair
They are treating you mildly
You should have been expelled
The Headmistress thought for a long time that would be best
But for once, mercy has prevailed
Will I be allowed to see you?
No, Manuela
But you won't abandon me?
It's better for you
I'm never to see you again?
I couldn't live
Manuela, what sort of talk is that?
You shouldn't think such things, let alone speak them
You must be brought to your senses
You must be cured whatever it takes
Cured?
You should not love me so much
You must go now
I must go
There's no point in your staying any longer
I'm going now
Goodbye, dear Fräulein von Bernburg
I must speak with you
You talked to her although I forbade it
Yes, I did.
I can answer for it
I think I maintained the spirit of your order
If anything happened to Manuela it would be very unpleasant for the Head
Is Manuela with you?
Is she hiding?
– This can't go on.
– We must help Manuela!
This rebellious spirit comes from you
I will not permit revolutionary ideas
Not while I am here
I won't cling to my post.
I know I can't stay here
I can't stand by and see children made into scared, helpless creatures
You go this way, and we'll go here
– Have you seen her?
– Where can she be?
"Our Father which are in Heaven
"Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come "Thy Will be done On Earth as it is in Heaven
"For Thine is the kingdom
"For ever and ever.
Amen"
– All I hear is "help her".
– We're talking about a human being!
You shall leave the school today
Quick, quick
Have you all gone mad?
What are the children doing here?
– Manuela wanted to throw herself down
We must thank God, Headmistress
The girls have prevented a tragedy which we both would have regretted all of our lives
Car smash?
Cement truck hit one of those baby austins.
Fractured skull, I guess.
You know, a man's a fool to ride in those miniature cars.
Be yourself. This is the guy that drove the truck.
Aww. Boy?
Little girl. Ah. Ahem.
Gee, I hope my baby's a boy.
I'll do my best, Archie. Man: Attagirl, mumsy.
Why can't my son have a screen around his bed?
It's against the rules. But this man has one.
Yes. He's dying. Oh.
Oh, nuts.
What makes you think you want to be a nurse?
Why, nursing people has always seemed sort of a second nature with me.
This is your only recommendation?
Who is this gentleman?
What's his business?
He's a grocer.
Oh, I'm sure I can make good if... my decision is final.
What does he mean "the time you were at high school"?
Didn't you graduate?
No, I had to leave when my mother died in the third year.
Probationary nurse must be a high school graduate.
I can make it up easy. I can go to night school.
You'll have neither the time nor the strength with work here.
Oh, I'm sure I would... besides, it wouldn't be allowed.
But I'm sufficiently well educated. There must be some way.
Not here.
Oh, I'm sorry. You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Did I catch the name?
Hart. Lora Hart.
Hart. That's a good name for a nurse.
Sturdy instrument, the heart.
Hello, Miss Dillon. Oh, good afternoon, doctor.
Now, what can we do for this young lady?
My dear, why didn't you mention the doctor?
Of course, doctor, anything you say.
Well, now, suppose you telephone the principal of Miss Hart's high school and if everything is satisfactory, we'll waive the rest.
Oh, thank you, doctor.
I hope you realize what you're letting yourself in for.
Nothing can be too hard.
Now, you take care of her, will you, Miss Dillon?
I've gotta be going.
This lady will take care of you.
By the way, Dillon, you're doing something wonderful with the hospital.
Everything runs like a clock.
I'm sorry you didn't mention Dr. Bell in the beginning. You'll find life here pleasant enough.
But there's one thing you must understand thoroughly:
Rules mean something.
I understand. You'll be told about them later.
You'll have one hour to yourself each afternoon and your evenings after 7.
But you're to be in bed and lights out at 10. There are no exceptions.
This decision is final.
I, ahem, see. Ahem.
You have one night out a week until 12 and quite a severe penalty if you're out later.
Miss Maloney, this is Miss Hart.
Lora: How do you do?
Take Miss Hart to the wardrobe and help her select some uniforms.
She hopes to be a probationer.
Miss Maloney will show you. Thank you.
Miss Maloney, you have no one sleeping in your room.
Miss Hart may go with you.
Yes, ma'am. Yes, Miss Dillon.
Yes, Miss Dillon.
Tails.
Heads. Life is going on for you in the same old way.
Say, I was afraid the hospital would burn down before I could get into it.
Now I have to watch myself with matches.
Well, if you hate it so, why do you stay?
It's the only job I know where they pay you to learn.
Oh, I'm sure in your heart you love it.
Says you. Yeah, says me in a big way, sister.
Goodness. Isn't there a smaller one?
If you don't like it, buy your own.
I can't. I haven't any money. Broke?
In a big way, sister.
Any advice?
What were you doing with the big shot?
Dr. Bell. Say, are you kidding me?
No, why?
You don't know bell?
He's the chief of staff. One of the biggest surgeons in america.
Why, he just stopped me in the hall and offered to help me.
For a beginner, you're not doing so bad.
We'll see if we can find one that fits.
Here, try that.
Oh, that's much better. You better slip off your dress.
Oh, it's okay.
Oh, I suppose so.
I guess everybody around here has seen more than I've got.
Oh, don't be embarrassed. You can't show me a thing.
I just came from the delivery room.
Maloney: What are you doing here, baby-frightener?
I come on behalf of this big institution to welcome the new sister to our midst.
You'll find we're just one big, happy family here.
Maloney: Beat it, eagan.
You're not sore, are you?
Maloney: I'm not laughing, veterinary.
How'd you like to go back to your sick horses?
Sometimes I don't like you, Maloney.
If only I could make that permanent.
What do you say, newcomer?
Lora: The score is 2-0, favor of the lady.
Take my tip and keep away from interns.
They're like cancer. The disease is known, but not the cure.
There's only one guy that can do a nurse any good, a patient with dough.
Catch one with a fever and a low pulse, make him think you saved his life and you'll be getting somewhere. Will i?
And doctors are no good either. Oh, no?
What for? They never marry nurses.
And the trouble with interns is they do.
All a wife means to an intern is someone to sit in his office when he starts practice and play nurse the rest of her life without pay.
Oh, I shouldn't like that. Thing to do is to land an appendicitis case. They've all got dough.
Gee, you look like an ad for sloan's liniment.
I don't care. As long as it means I'm not gonna be a probe anymore.
Oh, dear.
Yes, it's a shame.
Yes, it's a shame. There, there.
I was afraid old hatchet-face would see us. You sap. She'll be in here to see if we're in bed.
We better get in with all our clothes on.
No, no. Slip your dress off, put it on the end of the bed here.
If she sees that, it's okay.
Gee, if she switches on the lights and sees my makeup, I'm sunk.
Well, turn your face to the wall. Oh, don't get funny.
My makeup goes around the back of my neck.
Hurry up, kid.
If we're caught this time, it means a month of no nights off.
Jump in bed. I bet hatchet-face heard you.
Oh, I can't. Not with that. Psst.
Miss Hart, is it possible you have a man in here?
You worm. I hope you get caught in the nurses'quarters.
You know what you'll get for that.
Let him have it, and make it a bull's-eye.
Who threw that slipper?
What, ma'am?
What, Miss Dillon?
Dillon: Did you throw that slipper?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Dillon: Well, Hart?
Well, you see, I...
Dillon: Take two weeks on the night shift at the emergency clinic.
You've both just come in.
We had to walk home. This isn't your first offense, Miss Maloney.
You'll take four weeks on the same night shift.
Thank you. And take two more for impertinence.
See what you get for yelling?
Say, suppose you found a skeleton in your bed.
Maloney: If I could dodge that night shift, I'd live with one.
Oh, quit your trembling, kid. It can't walk around.
Dillon's face took all the pep out of it.
Well, at least he can't clear his throat.
[Lora clears thro at and giggles] Just a scalp wound.
Man: Oh, doctor. Hold tight to my hand when it hurts.
You're certainly charitable with that hand of yours. Was he hit anywhere else?
Sorry, but that's all.
Just put a bandage on him.
Give him a shot of anti-tetanus.
Prevents lockjaw.
Lockjaw?
Ask Miss Maloney about it. She's been fighting it off all her life.
Grit your teeth, prisoner.
Just two more smart cracks and Dr. Mayo is through.
Policeman: Shall I take him to the station house?
Oh, I don't think we'd better.
Let's keep him here tonight.
Yeah, prison ward.
Policeman: Hey, hey. Maloney:
Better get us a lift, lunkhead, he's fainted.
Oh, all right, Florence Nightingale.
Could a guy bum some bandages and iodine in here?
Are you hurt? No.
It's a friend of mine. He got a little cut on his hand.
Come in, I'll see what I can do. Oh, maybe I better wait here.
Come in. Ouch!
You're the one that's hurt.
All right, I'll come in.
Let's see your hand.
You'll have to get up earlier than most bootleggers to fool me.
How do you get that way?
We get many like you in here.
Oh, give us the iodine, will you? I'll fix it.
Say, I could do it myself if you'd just give me the...
I guess I better sit down.
Hey, what's the idea?
It's the arm, isn't it?
Oh, all right.
This one here.
Say, that's silk.
That's how I know you're a bootlegger.
You win.
That looks like a bullet wound.
Well, it's a cinch it ain't a vaccination mark.
I'll have to make a police report of this.
It has to be done on all bullet-wound cases.
Oh, say, that ain't necessary. I have to.
Oh, listen, sister, what's the difference to you?
I could get into trouble if I didn't.
Listen, just give me some bandages and forget you ever saw me.
How did it happen?
Well, a guy was cleaning a gun and it went off.
Oh, nonsense.
Well, that's my story, and a couple of cops with rubber hoses can't make me change it.
Where was this man cleaning the gun?
In a limousine.
It hit a bump and the gun went off.
Why did they wanna get you?
Oh, because I won't buy their bum alcohol.
I don't poison people.
Why don't you tell who these men are and have them arrested?
For the same reason you don't squeal about half the raw work you see down here.
Well, do you?
Why, we have professional ethics.
That goes for my line too.
The things my profession keep quiet about, we believe it's for the public's own good.
Ditto.
Well, it's gone clear through. You've lost a lot of blood.
What's up?
Say, that's a bullet wound.
Hey, nobody sent for you. Go rustle your hot-water bottles.
This is no hot-water bottle.
Did you get this bird's name and address?
I don't think that's necessary.
Maloney: Don't you know that you're supposed to report all bullet wounds?
You didn't see any bullet wound.
Say, what's the idea?
Friend of yours?
Thanks, pal.
He'd have to be hot before I'd take a chance like that.
You said something, sister.
Hold quiet, will you?
Hey, are you really taking a chance?
I'll say she is. All a nurse needs to do is to get into one jam and she's through.
Bootlegger:
Yeah? Oh, don't talk so much.
You might as well turn in your uniform and quit. Maybe 56 bucks a week isn't much, but it's 56 bucks.
Hey, is that all they pay you?
Better than selling apples.
That's probably what she'll be doing if she loses her diploma. Lora:
There you are. It's a nasty cut, but it'll be all right now.
Dump this. Thanks, sister.
My pal.
Eagan: What's his trouble?
Lora: He fell down stairs and cut his shoulder.
Eagan: Walks like he'd lost a lot of blood. Lora:
Hey, Maloney, don't forget to wash that bedpan.
And make it shiny.
Yes, do that.
You've seen blood before.
Just because this is your first don't make it worse.
I know... heaven's sakes if you get dizzy or feel faint, keep an eye on me.
Remember, this is the final test.
And if you pass out this time, you don't graduate.
Okay. Nurse: Wait a minute.
I almost forgot this. A man left this here. He said it was to be given to you before you went into your big test.
He seemed to think you'd know who he was.
Well, of all the... that's what I call a pal.
What'll I do with it?
Put it away for her.
But you're not allowed to drink. What's it good for?
It's swell for cleaning teeth.
Well, I hope Dr. Bell gets away with it.
He's got one chance in a hundred. Oxygen.
No. But when it does, it's bad news.
It's horrible.
Well, come on, let's get out of here. My teeth need cleaning.
Now, young ladies you who are about to graduate to the noble profession of nursing will recite the Florence nightingale pledge.
All: I solemnly pledge myself before god and in the presence of this assembly to pass my life in purity and practice my profession faithfully.
I will abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous and will not take or knowingly administer any harmful drug.
With loyalty will I endeavor to aid the physician in his work and devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my care.
Lora: I'm the new night nurse. Man:
Oh? For the two little girls?
Yes. I had them at the hospital some months ago.
Poor little kiddies.
It's a long time since I've seen them toddling up these stairs.
Good night, kiddies. Girls: Good night, Miss Maloney.
Lora: Hello there. Well, it's about time you showed up.
I'm dying on my feet. How did you wangle me into this job?
I told Svengali the kids knew you at the hospital and were crazy about you.
Thanks. Who's Svengali?
Dr. Ranger. He's a new one on me.
He's not on any hospital staff I know of, but he's sure the boss around here.
Why did they take Dr. Bell off the case?
That's what I'd like to know.
Certainly seems funny to me, replacing a man like Dr. Bell with an unknown.
Say, there's something screwy about this. What do you mean?
Since those kids got back from the hospital, they've been living on nothing but milk.
That's no cure for anemia, or malnutrition either.
I'll say it isn't. They were all right at the hospital.
Dr. Bell said they were getting along great. Aren't they improving?
No, they're getting worse. And I'm beginning to wonder why.
But why should anyone.?
Oh, you're crazy.
Maybe. I don't know a thing.
I just work here.
Any more instructions, Miss Maloney?
No, Miss Hart. Oh, yes, there's a chart pinned up in the kitchenette beyond the children's room.
Kitchenette?
Kitchen, bathroom, sitting room with every bedroom.
This dump's a palace. But not for those kids.
And, say, keep your eye open for old eczema.
Mrs. Maxwell. She's the housekeeper.
Wait till you see her.
Well, so long, honey. I got a date.
Oh, you don't know him.
A gorgeous new boyfriend.
Intern?
I should say not.
I'm not all crazy.
Nanny: Miss Hart. Miss Hart.
Stop it. Lie down, both of you.
Nanny, you silly little girl. You shouldn't try things like that.
You're not strong enough. I tried all I could, Desney.
Of course you did, nanny.
Poor little baby.
I didn't mean any harm.
I know you didn't, Desney.
But now you must both be quiet.
We will, won't we, nanny?
Yes. We will. Lora:
Desney: We like you. Don't we, nanny?
What's your other name? You didn't tell us at the hospital.
It's Lora. Lora Hart.
Lora?
We had a sister named Lora.
But she's dead.
Oh, poor little baby. You mustn't talk about her anymore.
Desney: She was runned over. She was all cut.
Cut in lots of places, wasn't she, nanny?
All over, here and here and here.
Oh, you ought to seen her. You mustn't think about her. You must go to sleep, both of you.
Desney: We didn't see her, but they told us.
Nick told us, and he showed us too.
Who's Nick?
Nanny: He lives here.
That's not your father, is it?
No. Daddy's up in heaven too.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Now, come on, both of you. Into bed.
Nick's not like daddy. Daddy was a nice man.
Isn't Nick a nice man?
No. He's a horrid man. Isn't he, nanny? Lora:
Oh, nanny, darling, don't cry, honey.
Such a nice home, lovely things and you're going to get well real soon.
It isn't a lovely home.
We didn't wanna come home. Did we, nanny?
Desney: Nick scares us.
Doesn't he, nanny?
He says the most awful things.
Lora: You should tell your mother. Desney:
She won't come and see us anymore.
Why aren't you two asleep?
They shouldn't be kept awake like this. I've been trying to make them go to sleep.
Desney: That's true. Then why didn't you?
We were hungry. Weren't we, nanny?
Maxwell:
Hungry? Don't be absurd.
But we are hungry. We're always hungry.
I want to speak to you. Lora: Are you Mrs. Maxwell?
Yes. I have charge of the children.
I don't want to hear another word out of you, either of you.
I wish we had something to eat.
Shh, or she'll come back.
Miss Hart, I must warn you not to be upset by anything the children may tell you.
They've been very sick.
Yes, I know. I had charge of them at the hospital.
Since they've been home, they've had bad dreams. Nightmares.
Dr. Ranger says that's all part of their illness.
But they're too young to know the difference between dreams and facts.
You must realize that whenever they tell you anything.
I see. Thank you.
That's all I had to say.
What do you want?
A lady needs a little assistance.
What lady? Shh.
You'll never guess.
She passed out.
What did you say? Are you going to be decent and leave?
The children's mother?
I've got to undress her.
It's all right.
Just the type.
Come here. Cut that out.
I want a kiss. I want a kiss.
I tell you, I want a kiss.
Lora: Stop it!
Let me alone.
Get busy, give her a stomach wash. I'll call a doctor.
Listen. You'll do what I tell you.
You trying to do what he did?
No, but you're not gonna call.
You're a nurse. You give her the wash. I can't, except under orders.
Oh, yes, you can. And what's more, you will.
I can't very well with a broken wrist.
Operator, get me a doctor, quick. End that or I'll break your neck.
What right have you to?
Plenty.
Hello, big boy. Oh, shut up.
Oh, don't be sore, Nicky. Kiss me.
Get busy. I can't without the proper authority.
I give you the authority.
Who are you?
I'm Nick, the chauffeur.
Operator? Don't be sore, big boy.
Where you going?
You dirty, lousy...
And I tell you, I wouldn't go through another night like that again for all the money they could pay me.
I locked the doors and windows and sat up until morning expecting that brute back. Well, did he?
No, but...
I see. It's unfortunate, Miss Hart, but not much likelihood of its happening again.
I'm going to make sure it doesn't.
Forget it. The police.
What'll that get you?
You don't... who'd believe you?
Believe me?
The Ritcheys wouldn't let you get away with that.
Blackmail's a pretty dangerous game.
Blackmail? You heard me.
Well, then, you don't believe me?
But, Dr. Ranger... I visited that house daily for months.
And I see no evidence of all this rot. Oh, yes, you have. You know you have.
I thought you were a reputable physician. I came here to ask your advice.
You shall have it: Mind your own business.
You're in that house to watch two patients, not to oversee the conduct of its members.
Am I to take blows from its servants?
I've said that wouldn't happen again. You guarantee that?
That'll do, Miss Hart.
You've forgotten your place long enough.
Quiet down, now, and I'll see that you're fully compensated.
It isn't.
Well?
Something's gotta be done.
You speaking of my patients?
You are the doctor.
The way things are going, those babies won't last.
Well, that's news to me.
Dr. Ranger, they're slowly dying of undernourishment.
Aren't my instructions being followed?
I suppose so. Here.
See about... yeah, quite correct.
But I know starvation symptoms when I see them.
I take it you don't approve... no, I don't.
It's your first case, isn't it?
You've been on one night.
It's only natural that you should get excited about something that puzzles you.
You know, Miss Hart, you talk too much.
You've picked up half-baked medical knowledge around the hospital.
All nurses do.
I wouldn't air it quite so freely. You'll talk yourself out of your profession.
Don't think you can muzzle me. I'm not trying to. I'm giving you advice.
You don't wanna take it, get off the case. I resign.
I warn you, if you do, you're through as a licensed nurse.
Oh, a threat?
Exactly. Your kind is too dangerous.
I have no doubt of it, to your kind of doctor but I'm gonna find someone who will listen to me.
Riverside 12468.
Uh, Nick, this is Dr. Ranger.
Now, listen carefully and I'll tell you what I want you to do.
Lora: I know it's my first case. And I know Dr. Ranger's a big man, but I've got to do something.
You got me the job, that's why I came.
But, my dear child... I'm sorry to drag you into this.
But those poor little kids are starving. Anybody can see it in their faces.
And if somebody doesn't do something, they won't last.
Don't get so worked up about it.
Don't you think I know starvation symptoms?
Yes, I suppose you do. Well, then, won't you do something?
You know I can't interfere in another doctor's case.
Why can't you, when things like this are going on?
It's about as unethical... oh, ethics, ethics!
That's all I've heard since I've been in this business.
Isn't there any humanity in it?
Aren't there any ethics about letting babies be murdered?
Steady. You need proof when you talk that way.
What more proof do I need than what I've already got?
Well, why don't you cool down a bit?
Those kids were getting along when you had them.
Why were you taken off the case?
Ranger's a rotten doctor. You know his reputation.
I can't discuss that. It isn't ethical.
Well, I can. Why doesn't he belong to the medical association?
Why hasn't he got a job on some decent hospital staff?
Because he's shady, and you know it, as well as every other doctor in this city.
I know a lot of things inside the profession that I can't advertise.
I also know that Dr. Ranger has a tremendous practice.
And that alone can keep him out of trouble.
If I stir things up, if I go to the authorities, what does it look like?
Jealousy. Argue yourself out of your responsibility.
I'll see this through. Will you be reasonable?
No! I won't see this go on another minute.
I'm going to the police. Lora! Don't you realize they'll only laugh at you?
You, a nurse on her first job, trying to pit your opinion against a man like Dr. Ranger.
Oh, what'll I do?
It's maddening.
Two little babies being murdered.
I could go out and yell it on the street.
Listen, you've got to convince people that what you say is true.
Hysterics won't do it.
I'll calm down, if you'll only tell me what to do.
My advice is for you to go back on that job.
If you are convinced of malpractice you can do more good there than you can shouting around on the outside.
Go back and watch those kids. We've got to play Ranger at his own game.
It's a risky business, and it's right under Ranger's nose. But if he wants to murder those youngsters, we'll make him use a gun.
I came to apologize for the way I acted this morning.
So you've thought it over?
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.
I hadn't gotten over the shock of last night.
I didn't realize what I was saying. I hope you'll overlook it.
Who were you talking to?
Why, I didn't discuss it with anyone.
I just sat in the park and thought things over.
I realized I was simply throwing my career away.
And I can't do that.
I thought you'd come around.
You're not the first hysterical nurse I've seen.
Entirely forgotten.
On both sides.
That little business of last night?
Oh, yes, of course.
I understand that such occurrences are all part of a nurse's experience.
That's it exactly.
Let me give you a little friendly advice, my dear.
The successful nurse is the one who keeps her mouth shut.
You see, we doctors have to do it. It's part of our professional ethics.
So naturally, we want nurses whose discretion we can rely upon.
I realize that now.
Good. Come on, run along, now, back to your case.
I'm sure everything's going to be pleasant. You're generous to keep me on.
Ranger: Since we understand each other, Miss Hart I shall probably have considerable work for you.
Oh, do you think so?
I like your spirit.
Just put it to use in the interest of your doctor, can you?
I think I can.
Good afternoon, doctor. Good afternoon, Miss Hart.
How do you do? I was told you wished to see me.
Oh, yes, I have wanted to talk with you but, oh, my head hurt so.
Lora: I hope it feels better now.
You know, if people only knew the tortures of neurasthenia they'd forgive us everything.
You see, Dr. Ranger forgot to send my bromides.
Oh. I do hope you weren't too upset by the conduct of the chauffeur.
You know... now, listen, poochie, stop that.
You know, we discovered, for some strange reason that Nick seems to irritate me less than any of the other servants.
So as far as feasible, Dr. Ranger wanted him to be my personal attendant.
Well, we'll just forget about it.
I'm sure you understand how much I'm depending upon you.
I'll do everything I can to help the children. Is that all?
Oh, I want you to have this, Miss Hart.
Why, I... just a little appreciation of your tactful conduct.
Oh, thank you very much. Is that all?
I'll be sending for you soon.
Well, what'd she want?
Gee, a hundred bucks. Yeah, isn't that a scream?
Hey, don't handle it like it's rubber.
I won't get very much kick out of spending it.
Listen, belle, for a hundred bucks, I'd take a couple of socks on the chin.
Funny what people think money will do.
Keeping our nose out of patients'private affairs is part of our professional ethics.
I'll kill the next one that says"ethics" to me.
Says you. Yeah, says me in a big way, sister.
Will you make this up for me?
For the little girls, eh?
Are they any better?
I wish I thought so.
Bootlegger: My pal.
Well, of all the places. And drinking a soda too.
Have one?
One of the same. Man: Yes, sir.
How's your friend's hand?
Oh, fine.
Good as new.
Say, you're looking pretty hot yourself. Thanks.
Hey, where'd you get that?
Looks like somebody took a swing.
Oh, a chauffeur at the place where I work got fresh. He socked you? On the level?
Well, not exactly on the level.
From a way down here someplace.
Why, the dirty...
I'll get him. What do you mean?
Say, listen. I know a couple of guys who'll do it as a pleasure.
You wouldn't do anything like that? I don't do a thing but tell a couple of guys I don't like this bozo.
Anyhow, you don't know who he is. All you gotta do is tell me.
I should say not. I don't want you getting in a jam over me.
There's nobody I'd rather get in a jam over.
Well, maybe there's nobody I'd rather keep out of a jam.
Maybe.
I tried to get you at the hospital.
Oh, I'm on private duty now. Nights?
Mm-hm. Then how about a buggy ride some afternoon?
Nurses have reputations.
Oh, I see.
What would you say if I told you I'd quit the racket?
I'd say I didn't believe you. Well, I did. A month ago.
So how about a ride some afternoon?
Tomorrow afternoon.
I'd like to, but I hadn't better.
Oh, come on. I've been crazy to see you ever since that night.
When I go riding it isn't gonna be with anybody that's liable to get shot.
But I tell you I'm all washed up. And I tell you I don't believe you.
On the level, sister.
Hey, you. Those two mugs won't wait forever.
Okay, I'm coming.
Say, we're just going to see the fights. Mm-hm.
Honest.
I'll find you sometime and prove I'm on the level. Hmm.
So long, sister.
She dozed off at last.
Oh, thank goodness.
Say, when did you take to worrying so much?
I didn't realize it was so serious.
It's sort of gotten on my nerves lately. It's about time.
And I heard something yesterday that I didn't like.
What?
Well, I'll tell you about it when I'm sure it's true.
Lora's late again. She would be. Every time I've had a decent date.
I think I'll blow and let you watch the kids till she comes.
Oh, you mustn't, with nanny as low as she is.
I wouldn't know what to do. Keep your chemise on, I didn't mean it.
If she wakes up, hadn't we better try paregoric?
A lot of good that'll do if she can't retain a murphy drip.
Oh, I wish Dr. Ranger would come. He'd know what to do.
Yeah. He would, all right.
I wish you'd try a milk bath. My sister edna saved her baby that way.
She did, I tell you, I was there. Well, let's not go into that again.
But if it worked once... it was a mistake. Well, it's about time.
Good evening. Maxwell: Good evening.
Where've you been?
That rich boyfriend of mine is waiting again.
I just saw eagan downstairs. He tried to duck, but I saw him.
I thought you was out delivering gin with that crush of yours.
I haven't seen him but once since that night in the drugstore.
Say, look, won't nanny love that?
Not the way she was feeling today.
Is she worse?
Yeah, took a nosedive.
I had to send Desney to Mrs. Maxwell's room.
Nanny can't keep anything down or up. Did you try a murphy drip? Mm-hm.
Oh, the poor little baby.
Have you called Dr. Ranger?
Yeah, I can't get him. He's in jersey on a case.
Well, I've done all I can do without orders.
You could give her a milk bath. My sister saved her baby with one.
You've got her started again. Well, good night, kid.
And good luck. And if you need me, give me a ring.
Lora: All right.
Why won't you try a milk bath?
Lora: She couldn't absorb nourishment through her pores.
But she might. We could try.
Oh, I didn't realize it was this serious.
Poor kids, the way we treated them. Lora: Shh.
Nanny. Nanny.
Look what I brought you.
Say, what's going on here?
A costume party?
Well, as I live and breathe.
Now, wait a minute.
Hold on... control yourself, big boy.
You don't know her. Yes, I do.
One time, I had a pain and the doctor put a big cone over my face and told me to take a deep breath.
And I did and I floated right up through the cone and when I came out the other end, there she was.
What have we here? Why, it's little miss iodine herself.
Do you know where I can find Mrs. Ritchey? It's important.
Well, if you're soliciting for a hospital, you're too soon.
Mrs. Ritchey won't need you till morning.
Yes. Do you know where Mrs. Ritchey is?
She's the latest innovation.
All the newest household bars have attachable sick nurses.
What's known as the morning-after pickup.
Pickup, yeah, whatever.
Ah, shut up. Ritchey: Go back and be barkeeper.
Tishy wants a drink.
Oh, tishy wants a drink, mack. Mrs. Ritchey. Mrs. Ritchey.
I wanna speak to you.
Well, go back of the bar and give tishy a little drink.
Nanny is very ill. You must come up to the nursery with me.
Nanny is dangerously ill.
Oh, you're crazy.
Oh, Mrs. Ritchey, I wouldn't come here if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
Nanny is almost dying.
It's my duty to make you come. Ridiculous.
Dr. Ranger is a grand splendid, magnificent doctor.
He's a magnificent doctor. Says she's almost well.
Don't be silly. Dr. Ranger hasn't been near her for two days.
She's sinking very low. You've got to come with me.
Shh. Utter confidence in Dr. Ranger. He's a magnificent doctor.
A marvelous doctor.
Says you're an alarmist, an alarmist.
He says that I can't see the children because it makes them so nervous and so upset.
Oh, don't you understand?
Nanny is dying.
Oh, go back of the bar and give tishy a little drink.
Mack, give tishy a little drink. Who says I am?
Oh, hello. I remember you.
What are you waving at?
You get out of here. He's mine.
You get out of here.
Dr. Ranger's a stupendous doctor.
And I love my big boy.
Don't stand there staring at me like that.
I'm a dipsomaniac and I'm proud of it.
I'm a dipsomaniac and I like it.
I like it. How do you like that?
You're a cruel, inhuman mother.
I'm a dipsomaniac... you're a rotten parasite, that's what.
Don't blame it on the booze. It's you.
Why do poor little children have to be born to women like you?
How can I.?
Mack, don't let her hurt my feelings... you're going up in that nursery if I have to drag you by the hair.
Mack, stop her.
Here, here, here. Just a minute, now.
Don't you realize that you're getting poor little miss all upset?
Say, you can't... come on, now.
Oh, snap out of it.
Stay on your feet. Let me alone.
You mother.
Mack: Say, you can't do that.
Lora: I know a couple of guys... bootlegger.
Hello, is Dr. Bell there?
Well, do you know where I can find him?
I'm Lora Hart, a nurse.
It's very important. Will he be at the hospital?
When does he come in, tell him Miss Hart wants him to come at once.
Tell him it's vital, because I can't find Dr. Ranger. Thank you.
Hey, sister, where can I find Nick?
Where'd you come from?
I'm delivering.
I thought you quit.
Oh, well, I guess I kind of exaggerated.
Say, are you working here?
And one of my little patients is dying.
Say, you might help me.
Well, if I can do anything... come with me.
Say, is this the dump you got the crack on the chin?
That doesn't matter now. Was Nick the guy?
I've got to think of this little child and you've got to help me.
Okay, sister.
Dr. Bell wasn't in.
Oh, what'll we do? What can we do?
Just wait for Dr. Bell, that's all. No use sending for an ambulance, nanny couldn't be moved.
Say, who is this bell guy?
Lora: Arthur bell, the surgeon.
Maybe I can find him. I know a couple of guys...
Lora:
How could you find him? Nobody can.
I wish for once you'd stop acting as though you knew everything.
Can't we try a milk bath?
Lora: Oh, that wouldn't do any good.
That's what saved my sister's baby.
It's a crazy idea, but we'll try anything. Maxwell: Oh, thank god.
But I'll need milk. Ten, 12, 15 quarts of it.
Can you get it?
Why, where do you buy milk?
Lora: In a grocery, a delicatessen.
Oh, I get you. Lora: Now, hurry, bootlegger.
Okay, sister.
Come in here, will you?
Where are you?
Where's he gone?
Where's our bootlegger?
He left 10 minutes ago. He won't be back.
That's what's wrong with prohibition.
Oh, I wish I could find one of those doctors.
Don't get Ranger. I don't like him.
No more.
Had my suspicions confirmed.
What suspicions?
I heard, on the telephone... what did you hear?
Tell me.
I heard what I heard. Oh, talk to me.
What did you hear? What about Ranger?
Not talking about him yet.
It isn't time. Oh, it is time, if it concerns those kids.
Will you talk to me? It's about Nick, isn't it?
I heard him talking to Dr. Ranger.
All right, you heard him talking to Dr. Ranger.
What did he say?
To Dr. Ranger.
Oh, will you pay attention to me? What did Nick say to Dr. Ranger?
Nick don't want people to see her when she's drunk.
Judge will take away the trust fund. Trust fund?
I had my suspicions.
Is Mrs. Ritchey in charge of the children's trust fund?
So that's what they're after.
Maxwell: Nick, you let us alone. Nanny's terribly sick.
Ah, shut up.
What are you up to with that kid?
I'm keeping her resting easily until a doctor comes.
Have you anything to say about that?
Depends on how you're doing it.
I'm giving her a milk bath. Dr. Ranger tell you to?
No, I can't find Dr. Ranger. Strange, isn't it?
Nothing's gonna be done without orders.
Then you get Ranger here so we can place the responsibility where it belongs.
I'm responsible when he ain't here. I'll say.
And I want Ranger's orders carried out. You'll be responsible for a lot more.
They use electric chairs for the kind of things you're responsible for.
Hey, just what's the idea behind that crack?
Don't you think I know deliberate malpractice when I see it?
You're speaking right out, ain't you? Yeah, and I'll make it even plainer.
In your case, I'm talking about murder.
Why, you little... keep your bean.
Don't bring me in. Lora: You're in already, plenty.
If this baby dies, you're in with Ranger.
Spill it, now. Come on.
How long did you think you could get away with this?
You think because you strong-arm women, you have the brains to put this over?
I had your number the minute I stepped in.
And I've reported my suspicions on the outside.
Spit them out. You want those kids to die.
You want what their father left them.
That's why you keep the mother full of booze all the time.
You'll take her out and marry her and grab the trust fund.
You're not gonna get away with it. Who said there was a trust fund?
So you've been shooting off your nutty ideas, huh?
Get out. Nick, you be careful, now.
I'm not afraid of you anymore.
Beating me up won't get you any place.
Poor little nanny. Nobody cares whether you live or die.
Gee, if you could only hear me.
I can. And I'm certainly glad I'm here.
Doctor, you did get my message. No, I didn't get any message from you.
But from a strange man, a most extraordinary fellow.
What man?
He said if I couldn't see my way clear getting here he'd call around some evening with a couple of friends and take me for a ride.
Did he say that? Yes, he did.
And I didn't like the way he said it, either.
Now, what's the trouble here?
Oh, she's low, doctor.
Very low.
Do you think there's anything we can do?
Only one thing.
A blood transfusion, and in a hurry. Take mine.
I'm type 4a. I've been typed.
But we don't know the baby's type. I know it, it's 4a.
Oh, doctor, we've got to hurry.
Who's got to hurry?
It's Nick, the chauffeur.
Oh, yeah.
I'm Dr. Bell.
We're about to give a transfusion and I ask you to keep out.
You're not on this case. You better get out.
Now, listen, this is a matter of life and death.
I'd run along if I was you. Oh, I can't be bothered with you... oh!
Oh, you dirty, lousy... oh!
Hey, you.
Yeah, I mean you. Get out of here.
Come on, and make it snappy.
That's a good girl. Splendid.
Oh, I... did I wake you? I'm sorry.
How do you feel? Lora:
All right, I guess.
How's nanny?
She's responded beautifully.
She'll pull out of it this time.
Hello, nanny. Hello, Lora.
Lora: Daylight. My goodness, have I been asleep that long?
Yes, and a good thing too.
You better go right home and go back to bed.
Losing all that blood can make you feel pretty miserable.
I can't. I have to hurry and get dressed.
I'm going to the police station first. Bell: Police?
Can't you see? I've got all the proof I need now.
And I'm going to the bat for you.
Lora: Gee, doctor, you're swell.
No, just sleepy.
Oh. You.
Ah, go on, let me in, will you?
You know me, I've been here before. Tony knows me too.
Hey, what are you trying to pull?
Only, you make any joint look like a speakeasy.
Oh, Dr. Bell. Take good care of nanny, Maloney.
She's had a blood transfusion. Keep in touch with me every hour.
Well, how about Dr. Ranger?
I'm going to settle with him once and for all. I'm going to engage a new night nurse.
A night nurse?
What's the matter with you?
Well, it's a certainty Mrs. Ritchey will not want Lora around after she learns what Lora has decided to do.
Are you gonna sign a warrant?
If it's the last thing I ever do.
Don't be a fool. You'll never get another job.
One jam like this and even the patients are leery of you.
Will you give me a lift downtown?
I'm in a hurry.
Give you a lift?
I've been waiting for the chance.
Well, how about a date tonight?
You're not much to look at, but you do have a way of showing up when you're needed.
Come here. By the way, what's your name?
Mortie. Glad to meet you.
Mine's Lora Hart. It's the last name I like.
You won't be able to drive with one arm.
Sure I will. When I say shift, shift.
Shift.
Hey, stupe, look where you're going.
Try again.
Happy? Uh-huh.
But there's one thing. What?
I hate to think of Nick being arrested and that dirt coming out in court on account of those little kids.
Maybe Nick won't be arrested. Why not?
I ain't seen him around since last night. Think he's run away?
Well, what do you think?
I ain't got an idea.
Only, I happened to be talking to a couple of guys... what difference does that make?
Only, I happened to mention I didn't like Nick so good.
What is it, for us? Nope, for the morgue.
Some guy got taken for a ride.
Bootlegger?
No, he was wearing a chauffeur's uniform.
Don't let Haley see you.
Ah, Haley can kiss my hand if he don't like it.
How are you, Davenport? You stop calling me that.
Honest to goodness, you getting something fierce.
Hog-wild, baby, no fooling.
Scramble three and a cup of jamocha.
Scramble three in a hurry. It's Bill White. Bread or toast?
Or maybe you'd like a bun.
No, had one last night.
I bet you did, you devil.
Say, who was your bun with?
You got me jealous and everything.
Seventeen, 18, 19 Step on them eggs, gal
When I go, I gotta go fast
Shoot three and take up the brakes MAN:
Say, listen, you didn't tell me who you was out with, smarty.
She wouldn't have been no nice girl, drinking and all that. Says which?
You're ahead of me, babe.
A way ahead.
Oh, you know what I mean. MAN: Pick it up.
Thirty-one, 32, 33...
WAITRESS: You got more nerve, honestly.
How do you get away with it? what?
You know it's against the rules to leave the cab when the train's going.
Somebody's been stringing you.
Haley thinks it's good exercise for us guys. Baloney.
You do it every time you pass.
Oh, well, darling, I'd break every rule in the world for you, Tootsie.
Give us a little butter, and leave it off the check.
I bet you say that to every dame you meet, don't you?
Forty-five, 46, 47...
I know darn well you do.
Lookit, you're a nice kid.
why don't you cut out the fly-by-night stuff and settle down?
Because I can't seem to get all my women together in one place.
Hey, you're a dime short.
Have a little chew on me, baby.
Toodle...
What's up? MAN 1:
Darned if I know. What's up?
MAN 2: Hot box on 912.
Oh, yeah?
How'd you like to go for a chicken dinner tonight?
Boy, now you're talking pretty. where?
Out to my shack.
It's our second anniversary, and Lily's fixed up a swell feed.
It's too far out just for dinner.
If it included a couple of bottles of booze, everything would be okay, huh?
Boy, that ain't a bad idea. Yeah?
It wouldn't be a bad idea if you'd spend Sunday there and get yourself a good night's sleep and some fresh air.
Too quiet out of town.
You'd rather hang around Fishback's Dance Hall with that dizzy dame, Marie, and the rest of them popeyed hash slingers.
Hey, listen, don't be panning my lady friend.
well, keep it up and you'll wind up behind the eight ball.
And what'll I be doing?
working hard, getting promoted to superintendent.
I'll end up in the front office as GM as sure as you're born.
You're also gonna break your arm if you don't quit patting yourself on the back.
Here, pal, have a little chew on me.
Hi, gang. well, if it ain't the old kid himself.
Hi, Ed.
Come on down.
I can't.
Don't wanna get the glad rags all dirty.
Come up here and get a breath of fresh air.
Okay, boy, coming up.
How are you, Ed? when did you get back?
Now, on 912.
Did you get much rest? Did I?
Never slept a wink all the while I was gone.
Going to the fight tonight?
Nelson's gonna kick the pants off that ape from Memphis. Yeah?
what a fighter that guy is.
He's got a left like nobody in the world.
He shoots that left first straight, okay?
And he jabs with his right. Yeah.
Left again, right again. Yeah.
And keep that right hand high. Yeah, right cross.
what an infighter. what an infighter.
Starts slow.
And one, two, three, four, five, see?
Keeps aiming right for the chest, you know?
Then he brings it up, shoots it left, brings it right down. Finished.
Oh, boy, I'm going if I can get rid of Marie.
where you going with that cluck? Did you say cluck?
I said cluck.
I promised to take her someplace.
Can't you give her a standup? Can I give her a standup?
That's my specialty.
Here, Eddie, have a little chew on me.
Okay. where you gonna be later? I'll be around.
Right-o.
See you tomorrow.
Anything else you guys want?
Yeah, give me a big slice of you on toast and some french-fried potatoes on the side.
Listen, baby, I'm A.P.O.
what does she mean, A.P.O?
Ain't putting out.
Besides, I'm Bill White's girl, and I'm a one-man woman.
That's a hot one. what do you mean, that's a hot one?
Didn't I see you down at Fishback's Dance Hall last night with Elmer Brown?
Elmer's a kind of a cousin of mine.
Some cousins are sure affectionate.
Nevertheless, he's my distant cousin.
That's her story, and she's gonna stick to it.
It's the story Bill's gonna hear unless you guys do some broadcasting of your own.
well, don't worry, not me.
I ain't gonna get in no trouble. MARIE:
Then stop shooting off your big mouth. MAN:
Hey, Marie.
Give me a flock of doughnuts with small holes.
If there are any small holes around here, I'll eat them myself.
How are you, baby?
Don't pull any of that stuff around here.
Too much of a gallery looking on.
well, what of it?
Love you, baby.
I'm crazy about you. Crazy about you.
I can't breathe without you.
You know what day this is?
Saturday's one day I never forget.
It's something else too.
It's the day we get married.
Married?
well, don't tell me you don't remember. what?
well, you asked me, and I said I would.
Oh, I'm a son of a gun.
well, you want to, don't you? Oh, sure, sure.
well, let's go ahead and make it today.
I'm tired of working.
well, I'm afraid I can't do that.
why not?
well, you see, it's Jack's anniversary.
He and Lily are having a big blowout tonight, and I gotta be there.
Oh, yeah?
Lily's gone ahead and cooked up a lot of stuff.
why, if I didn't show up, she'd burn up.
How about taking me with you?
Oh, no, no, I couldn't do that.
well, you see, it's this way.
Lily ain't like you and... Yeah, I see.
I ain't good enough for Lily Kulper.
Go there yourself, and stay there. wait a minute.
You got me all wrong.
If I ain't good enough to meet your friends I wouldn't marry you if you were the last man on Earth.
You're killing me.
MARIE:
Wait a minute, my eye.
You can't take a run-off powder on me and get away with it.
You ain't gonna bust us up that way.
Listen, I'd do something desperate.
You know what a jealous guy I am.
If I catch you out with any other bird, I'll... MARIE:
Well, drop in to Fishback's Dance Hall tonight and get an eyeful.
And if you offer me a chew of gum now, I'll knock your block off.
Oh, baby, dearest, sweetheart.
Got anything for a headache? Yeah. Okay.
Eight bucks.
Have a little chew on me.
Okay, pal.
Oh, hello, Jack.
Hello, Haley.
Looks like you're gonna garden this summer.
Yeah, sweet peas and radishes.
That's about all I've got room for out there. Yeah?
Say, how's Bill White getting along up front?
All right. why?
Keeping sober?
Not drinking a thing, huh?
well, I'm glad to hear it.
Going to sleep in the bathtub with the water running and all.
Listen, I wa...
Don't you make fun of me, you scamp.
Three months back in your rent and trying to pull the house down over my ears:
Oh, darling, precious, dearest.
well, well, what kind of a party is this?
This is a little coming-out party.
I came right out on my rump.
Say, if he's a friend of yourn you better get him out of here before I have him pinched.
Anything you say, lady.
You just keep his trunks here.
we'll send for them later.
Come on, egg.
we got business elsewhere.
I had a swell time at your p...
Aw, nuts. Goodbye.
BILL:
Have a little chew on me.
Filthy old bum.
Some fun, eh, kid?
Hey, did you ever see Charlie Murray?
Not bad, huh?
Boy, that's great.
Hey, have a little chew on me.
Thanks. Don't mention it.
JACK:
well, here's the mansion.
Say, is this cute, or ain't it?
we like it. Come on in.
Oh, no.
I hadn't better.
Oh, because your wife will throw me out sure as blazes.
You know they always do when you bring a guy home with a bun on.
You're all right now.
The walk did you good.
Yeah, I know, but how about the breath?
wouldn't know you ever had a drink.
Here, have a little chew on me.
Hey, wait a minute. wait a minute.
Let me take the paper off.
Silly, isn't it? Silly?
You're just a big goat.
Not bad, huh?
How are you, Peg-Leg?
Just doing a bit of chopping for the missus.
Oh, you brought a trowel.
Sure, and some sweet peas and cornmeal and something else. LILY:
What? JACK:
I parked it in the other room. LILY:
why, Bill.
Bill White.
Hello, you little devil, when'd you blow in?
why, I'm Lily.
Say, I wouldn't forget you in a thousand years.
I ask about her every day, don't I, fella? Sure.
Get your coffee.
I'll draw some water.
Make the first one cold.
Hey, she's wise.
I gotta beat it.
You don't know Lily. Yeah, that's it.
See, I'm liable to pull another boner.
Swear or something.
You know I don't go over so good with her kind. Aw, shut up.
Come on, boys. Line up.
The party's ready.
why, you old son of a gun. I haven't seen you since I was knee-high.
I suppose you're raising the devil the same as you used to.
who, me?
No, I've calmed way down.
Pig-Leg.
Peg-Leg.
All right, maybe I'm wrong.
The tub's almost ready.
I think you'll find everything you want.
Oh, we better ask Jack about the razor.
You like Bill well enough to let him use your razor? JACK:
Hey, fella, that razor's about to get its first break.
PEG-LEG: What the devil kind of a shovel do you call this, anyhow?
It isn't the shovel. It's you. Is that so?
well, I'll show you.
Now, you watch me.
Oh, that slipped.
I never saw such a dull shovel as this in me life.
Let me do it, then. Come on.
PEG-LEG:
Listen, take your lily-white hands off it.
LILY: Come on, let me have that. PEG-LEG:
I never start anything that I can't finish.
who pushed me? BILL:
Stand aside, ladies and gents, and let a man what knows how to dig, dig.
But you ought to be in bed getting your sleep.
Leave him work. It'll take some of that fat off him.
Yeah?
Behave, now.
If you're gonna dig, stay close to the fence.
I'm gonna put sweet peas all along there, see? Sweet peas?
Gee, that'll be swell.
I'll follow along behind you and put in the seeds.
Dang it, I gotta be of some use here somehow.
I'll punch the holes, huh? JACK:
Quiet out there.
Fat chance you have to sleep.
Oh, that tickles.
what's the matter?
Say, is this an operation or a haircut?
Oh, don't be a baby.
That was a hair I pulled.
These scissors aren't very sharp.
Try the lawn mower.
wait a minute.
what are you looking for?
A piece of ear.
Cut out this nonsense, now, and let me finish, would you?
Nobody's gonna look like a tramp in my family.
JACK: Hey, you Indian.
How's a fella gonna study with all that racket going on?
Come here, darling. See if you can handle him.
I've stood enough.
Pick on somebody your size, you big gorilla.
Take that, and that, and that.
Stop, will you? Stop it.
Jack, Jack, make him stop. Jack.
Lay off me.
Running away from me? No.
You big sissy.
Call for help, huh?
Call for help, call for help?
You coward.
Listen, I won't make biscuits for supper or cream gravy:
Where you going? JACK:
None of your business. LILY:
Ice cream, ice cream for supper.
Did you ever see such a kid?
I'm gonna be pushing her around in a baby buggy.
For that, I'm gonna leave you flat and go and start supper.
Here's my half for the ice cream.
And say, get the kid a bag of chocolates, will you?
we're spoiling her.
who cares?
Say, do we need anything from the drugstore?
Yeah, she said something yesterday about wanting some toilet water.
Aw, for crying out loud.
Hey, listen, don't forget and get me a half dozen packages of gum.
Anything I can do, Lily?
well, let's see, you might put on some water while I sift flour for the gravy.
Gee, these flowers are slick.
They smell up the whole room. LILY:
Yes, aren't they sweet?
Bring the yellow pitcher, Bill.
Cut that out.
what shirt did you put on this morning?
Just a shirt.
well, you got the wrong one.
That one's got a button off.
who cares? I do.
Now, go and change it like a good boy.
Lily, I haven't got time, honest.
where you going?
Turn around, Bill.
Let me sew this on.
Stand still, now.
I want you to look nice.
Gee, you're a sweet kid, you know that?
I'm glad you think so.
I like people to like me.
People I'm fond of.
You fond of me?
Oh, yes, terribly.
You're such a help around the house.
You know, Bill, you ought to be married.
You'd make a wonderful husband.
Aw, quit your kidding.
Besides, I ain't found the girl I want yet.
what kind of a girl do you want?
A girl just like you, or there's no dice.
Now you're kidding me.
No, I ain't kidding.
I'm on the level.
Do I really mean that much to you?
Say, I think you're the swellest girl in the world.
Oh, you're a dear.
And just for that, I'm gonna give you a little kiss.
Don't. we mustn't.
Kiss each other.
Do you love me, Lily?
I must...
Yes, honey.
what are you thinking about?
About Jack.
I wish I knew what we could do about him.
I don't know what we could say except that we didn't mean to fall in love with each other.
I thought all the time I loved him.
we've got to tell him the truth, Lily. Oh, no.
we've got to play fair.
It'd almost kill him if he knew.
I couldn't...
But he's got to know some time.
Oh, I know, but... Now, get this straight.
when a guy's a pal of mine, I don't play around with his wife.
I'm sorry, Lily.
I deserved it. No, you don't.
You haven't done anything wrong.
I kissed you. Oh, but look.
The first time it happened, we didn't mean to start anything.
Only a minute ago, all three of us were playing together.
Happy as a bunch of kids.
Now only one of us is happy.
And that's because he doesn't know about the other two.
we're not happy.
There's no way we can be.
So let's at least keep him happy.
That's kindergarten bluff, Lily.
You've got to tell a good guy the truth no matter how much it burns him up.
But do you think the three of us could go on living under the same roof?
Because I love you, Lily.
If you're here near me, I'll take you. Do you understand? I'll take you.
You love me. You said so.
we belong to each other, and that's the way it's gonna be.
But Jack's got to know about it, and he's got to know right now.
I got two Sunday papers.
Might as well have enough to go around.
Here's your gum.
Here's your ice cream, hon.
Strawberry and chocolate.
Fine, put it on ice, will you?
Gee, it's hot.
I heard they had a big rainstorm over east of us last night.
Yeah, we'll probably run into it tomorrow on our way out.
Hear that, fella?
what's he doing?
why, I don't know.
I'll go and see.
Oh, dear, carry in the roast for me, will you?
what's the matter, hon?
You're as white as a ghost.
Oh, I'm all right, really.
Here, now, hold the platter while I dish up this meat and potatoes.
Let's get them on the table right away.
what's the rush?
why, everything's ready, dear.
There, now, carry that in now like a dear and start carving.
It won't take me but a minute to get the rest in.
Hey, make that lunkhead do some of that.
what's he think he is around here, anyway?
Boy, front.
Stir them doggies, or you're gonna get cold hash.
For the love of Mike...
I wonder what got into him.
what are you crying for?
Sure you are.
Come on, now. Tell me.
Tell you what, dear?
Is the meat too rare?
why did he go, Lily?
why, I don't know.
Did you send him away?
Did you quarrel about something?
You have no idea what it's all about?
No, I haven't.
Oh, I forgot your coffee, dear.
Please eat your dinner, dear.
Lily you wouldn't lie to me, would you?
why, of course not.
There's nothing to lie about.
I give you my word there isn't.
You do believe me, don't you?
You must. why must I?
Because I'm telling you the truth.
You're not through your dinner, are you?
I think so.
Down to the yards.
Aren't you awfully early?
I've got some business to attend to before we go out.
LILY: I see.
JACK: Good night.
BILL: Corned beef hash.
A plate of mystery for one.
Is that all, please?
Hello, Marie.
Hello, stranger. where you been keeping yourself?
Around.
Not around here, I'd say.
Nor Fishback's either.
They got a new orchestra.
That so? Yeah.
I've been dancing my head off these days.
Four, five times a week, I'm there.
Is that all you're gonna eat?
Yeah, I ain't hungry.
I know where I can get you a little slug of gin.
I don't think so.
You don't want a drink?
No, I quit a long time ago.
Oh, some dame made you swear off, huh?
You can leave the poached egg off that hash. Ooh!
what you eating?
Hash.
How much time have we got?
Seventeen minutes.
Just coffee, Marie.
You walked out on us today. How come?
I didn't want any dinner.
Something affect your appetite?
It's too hot to eat.
I thought maybe you and Lily had a row. Not exactly.
Nothing to worry about.
what was it?
Oh, just an argument.
An argument, huh?
what about? Nothing.
I told you a minute ago.
People don't argue about nothing and walk out of the picture sore. Sore?
who's sore?
I ain't.
what have I got to be sore about?
Oh... well, I'm glad it wasn't anything serious.
Coming to the house with me when we come in from this run? No.
It's too quiet out there. It gives me the willies.
I like to have a little fun once in a while.
What do you mean, fun?
You and Lily used to tear the roof off, nearly.
what seems to be eating the boyfriend? JACK:
He's spoiled. we were too good to him.
You and Lily?
I always say there's nothing like the influence of a good woman.
Give me a check.
Thirty-five, please.
And pay the cashier on the way out.
what's your hurry?
I'm going over to the Y to do some stuff before I check out.
Didn't he act funny?
That must have been a terrible fight they had.
He and Lily.
Yeah, yeah, we always fight like that. Just like kids.
Any sign of Bill?
what do you mean, not yet?
we're due out of here in 30 seconds.
where do you think he is?
He said he had to go over to the Y. Oh, he did?
well, you just made it, eh?
Yeah, just.
So you're not coming back to the house with me?
No, Jack, I've told you that twice now.
I thought maybe you might change your mind.
were you comfortable out there?
Food suits you all right?
what is this, a game?
You been harping on it for over an hour.
well, I just wanna know what to tell Lily.
She'll be expecting you, won't she?
Oh, lay off, will you?
Am I supposed to be on trial or something?
You haven't answered my question.
I don't feel like answering questions.
Something on your mind? No.
There's something on your conscience.
why don't you lay the cards on the table and say what you're thinking?
I've known you for 20 years, Bill and it's taken me all this time to find out you're yellow.
You heard me, didn't you?
I ain't got tin ears.
You're yellow, and you're a rotten double-crosser.
I don't believe you mean it.
Yes, you know what you've done.
I ain't done anything.
Neither has Lily. You're a liar.
I'm no fool.
The way you both act has been enough to convince me.
Put the brakes on your tongue before you answer.
what is there between you and Lily I'm not supposed to know?
I suppose you expect me to believe that.
I don't expect you to, but it's the truth.
You lying...
You might as well calm down and quit trying to get a rise out of me.
Listen to what I'm gonna say because I'm gonna say it.
You're pretty late about it.
That's the one thing I'm sorry for.
You had it coming to know everything.
what do you mean, everything?
That Lily and I found out, all of a sudden, we loved each other.
Happened all of a sudden, out of a clear sky.
I couldn't help that part of it.
we sat down and talked it over and tried to figure out what to do about you.
So you finally thought about me, did you?
Plenty.
I was for telling you the minute you came in, then Lily didn't wanna hurt you.
That's funny.
So you decided to pull the wool over my eyes and let it go at that?
we've been on the level, both of us.
That's another lie. You and Lily...
Now, wait a minute.
Say anything you want to about me, but leave Lily out of it.
She's okay.
She was till I brought you out to the house.
what did you do to her?
You made her a dirty, rotten...
what the sam hill's the matter?
Didn't nobody see that stop board? No.
Taking a nap, you two, huh?
well, we sure knocked that rattler into a pile of junk.
Is he out?
What's the matter? MAN 2:
Take his feet, Mike.
Don't Jack know a stop board? MAN 3:
He's hurt.
Yeah, it's a bad cut.
Get him over to the station.
Tell that dispatcher to dig up a doctor.
Lucky nobody else was hurt. Okay.
HALEY: You boys carry him back.
I'll wire the hospital. MAN: Okay, Jim.
You stay here, Bill.
I'll be doggoned if I see how it could've happened.
Jack is a darn good hogger.
That ain't the way my report's gonna read.
Right now, they're cutting off plenty of heads at HQ.
well, his won't come off.
It wasn't his fault he passed the board.
Is that so?
It's his job to see that board.
He's responsible.
And where was he?
Out getting a manicure?
Firing for me.
Firing for me.
Drunk again, eh? Yeah.
Jack's kept you off of that suspension list time and again.
This time, it's gonna cost you about six weeks' pay.
And maybe your job.
You stand by till I get Evans on the key.
Darling, you...
Say, I'm nuts about you.
Hey, give us a couple of kisses.
Ain't this just like old times?
You and me necking and you getting plastered.
Say, I ain't plastered.
I didn't say you was. I said "getting".
Remember when we was gonna get married?
Say, you broke my heart.
Oh, I felt so bad.
I couldn't look at another guy for weeks.
Say, listen, don't you get sentimental.
Don't you get sentimental.
Don't you get sad.
I thought of something.
Here we are mooning around because we split up when we can get married tonight if we want.
Say, you're a great girl.
You got some great ideas.
Are you game?
we can catch the midnight train over in Newcomb and get the license.
License?
Marriage license, silly.
we'll get a couple of them. Come on, let's...
Let's dance over.
we'll hotfoot it over.
Some fun, eh, kid?
why didn't you phone you was gonna be late?
Now, baby, use your nut.
You know I was on that mule.
wished to all I could.
I had to stop at the roundhouse and talk to that foreman for 15 minutes.
Some fixing had to be done on the engine.
And then I had to get cleaned up, and that took plenty of time, believe me.
Some dirt.
And I had to get into these glad rags.
That took a few minutes, you know.
Besides, we ain't only missed a dance or two.
Baby, you look like $ 700 tonight. I'm telling you.
we're gonna got married.
Boyfriend, silly.
when?
Give me your flowers, will you, Pearl?
Sure, hon. Take them.
Married, huh?
Gee, ain't that swell?
Listen, fella. MARIE:
Listen nothing.
well, what's the matter with you?
Take those off.
A bride's gotta have some kind of bouquet.
And sweet peas are as good as anything.
Say, who do you think you're talking to?
wait here, hon.
All alone?
Going over to the YMCA.
Smart move.
Grab yourself some sleep, will you?
You've been going at it pretty hard for about a month now.
Seen Kulper?
Jack Kulper.
Somebody just told me he's just out of the hospital.
Going over to see him?
Yeah. I'm going over there in a couple of days.
See, I don't want him to see me like this.
what do you say?
Suppose I walk down to the Y with you?
I can get over there myself.
You been sick?
No, I've been quite well.
well, I heard that Jack was back home and I thought maybe I'd run over and say hello.
I don't think you can see him, Bill.
He doesn't wanna see you.
Did he say so?
Gee, Lily.
I gotta see him.
we can't go back working together being enemies.
Just one talk will do it.
Gee, all the three of us can sit down and have it out, clean the slate.
Who is it, hon? LILY:
Somebody was asking about you, dear.
JACK: One of the boys? LILY:
JACK: why didn't you lead him in?
It's kind of monotonous sitting here with nothing to listen to but that rain.
LILY: I'm sorry.
Stone-blind.
PEG-LEG: Well, well, well. How are you, Bill, you old scamp?
Peg-Leg to you.
why's he acting like that?
was he drunk?
Rushing out of here like a wild man.
LILY: He didn't know about Jack.
I think it upset him.
PEG-LEG: Well, well, old-timer, what are you doing there?
Let me help you back.
There now, take it easy.
we have more of these cloudbursts, we'll all be wearing life preservers.
Lily scared?
I bet a plugged nickel she ain't.
She wouldn't say so if she was.
She's a game one, she is.
LILY: Yes, dear?
Anything I can get you?
How long will it take you to pack? LILY:
Pack?
I'm sending you away for a few weeks.
where?
Back home to your folks.
why do you want me to go away?
The river's rising, for one thing.
It isn't safe here.
Oh, but I'm not afraid of the river.
It isn't a question of fear.
It's common sense.
I'd feel better if you went.
But I'd rather not go, if you don't mind.
Do we have to argue about it?
But I'd rather stay. why?
Because you feel sorry for me?
Oh, honey, no.
Oh, I'm tired of this pity, sick of it.
Every time you speak to me or touch me, it's the same thing over and over again and I can't stand it any longer.
That's why I want you to go, if you must know.
I'll pack right away.
You were kind of rough on her for a minute.
I thought you meant it.
She thought you did.
I guess she did.
MAN: All right, laddies, step on it.
That's all of them, boys.
All aboard.
She's all done.
How many trips does this make?
I didn't count them.
I kind of lost track myself after the first 14 hours.
Buck up, fella.
I know it's pretty tough to lose your sidekick but you're taking it too hard.
Ain't anything you can help.
The company will look after him.
Besides, he's got a swell little wife that'll wait on him hand and foot.
You were out to the house for a while.
They got a sweet little place out there, haven't they?
Jack will be all right as soon as he gets used to the idea of being blind.
That's the hard part, I guess.
Nothing to do but think.
Soon as we finish up, I'm gonna curl up in that switch shanty and grab a nap.
I got something else to do.
Something I've been thinking about.
You ought to better be thinking about that bridge.
Yeah, I am.
How to save it, you mean?
It's just a screwy notion.
well, if you've got any kind of an idea, bring it over to that yardmaster.
They tell me he's going crazier by the minute.
I thought I would.
Hey, Bixby, how is she holding?
Hello, fellers.
Always room for one more.
Looks like a lodge meeting.
what do you got under your hip?
BIXBY: Oh, just some coffee.
I heard the news, so I thought I'd bring you down some refreshments.
Bixby?
Yeah, sure thing, you know.
Old Roundhouse Bixby.
Couldn't fool you, could I, boy?
Say, you ought to hold this meeting up in the auditorium.
News got around among the boys, they'll be coming by the dozens.
By the what? There's only seven of us left.
Seven and a half with Peg-Leg.
Sit down, fellow, have some coffee.
why don't you taste it?
Maybe it's hot.
You got too much brains for one man.
well, carry on, you loafers.
So long, Bix.
Oh, rats.
How are you, boy?
Hello, Peg.
Say, you know, I pretty near crabbed the whole works in there just now.
Oh, him so young and everything.
Oh, there's the devil to pay.
You know, I thought it's better for him to be down here among the boys.
where's his wife?
Shipped back to the folks in the East.
And you listen. The poor thing got so thin you could blow through her.
Isn't that a good one?
well, I gotta get moving.
well, so long. So long, Bix.
So long.
Criminy, this place sounds like a circus.
Turn the noise down. Turn the noise down, would you?
Oh, Bixby. wait a sec.
Someone, go and get Bixby.
Roundhouse wants him.
well, well, well, if it isn't the old-timer.
How are you getting along?
Slick.
You can't keep a good hogger down.
How about some more java?
Sure, I could go for a spot.
Let me rinse that cup.
Now you shut up.
No. why, the young fool, he's crazy.
You know that, Kennedy.
MAN 1: I wonder what the yardmaster wants.
Something's popping up.
BIXBY: I know we talked it over.
But that's a job I wouldn't ask any man to take.
I wouldn't let him take it. what...?
Here's Bailey.
Maybe he knows something about it.
what's the matter with Bill White?
Is he off his nut?
He wants to do it.
He's there trying to talk Kennedy into it.
Into what?
Into taking an engine and a string of flats out onto the bridge.
He figured that the weight of a trainload of cement would hold the bridge steady.
That is, if anything would.
It's an awful risk.
But there's just a chance he might get by with it.
A thousand-to-1 chance.
That's just it, a thousand-to-1.
Say, if I wanted to bump myself off as bad as that, I'd take an easier way.
BIXBY: Well, I'll be right over.
You wait till I get there.
I thought maybe Kulper could do something with him.
How about it, Jack?
what gave him the idea?
I don't know. we was talking about you and Lily and the swell little place you had.
I said, "I think you better turn in for a nap".
He said, "I got something to do, something I been thinking about".
I said, "well, you better be thinking about that bridge".
He said, "I am". I didn't pay any more attention to him.
You know how crazy he is. MAN 1:
Crazy is no name for it.
I heard him try to bull Kennedy out of an engine.
MAN 2: Maybe he won't give it to him.
Kennedy's willing to try anything.
He's got an engine and a string of flats headed for the bridge.
MAN 3: Who made them up? Bill did, over in the East Y.
Just waiting for Kennedy to say the word.
Excuse me a minute, I have to...
JACK:
No, no, thanks, Peg-Leg. I can make it myself.
PEG-LEG: Maybe he's sick.
we'd better give him a hand.
well, where is he?
I can't do it on my own responsibility.
You know that, White.
why?
You've got the say-so when it comes to trains.
Not trains, train schedules.
well, what's this but an extra?
Chalk me up as going out on a little extra run.
You don't have to ask the sup about that.
Do you realize what you're asking me?
Yeah, nothing.
Just a little matter of life and death to you and a risk of losing a work engine and several flatcars.
There ain't no risk to it.
I've told you that over and over.
Look, all I'm gonna do is to take...
Oh, hello, Mr. Wayne.
He wants me to let him have an engine and some flatcars to take out on the bridge.
It was a crazy idea, but it took guts to think it.
I gotta hand it to you, son.
Oh, you guys make me sick.
MAN 1: What's happening?
MAN 2: There's something happening.
where do you think you're going?
I'm taking this engine out on the bridge.
You're off your nut.
I still know what I'm doing. You don't.
what makes you think I don't?
You got everything to live for.
You're trying to toss it away and yourself with it.
I ain't trying anything.
I'm gonna take this engine out.
You don't belong on here.
You're gonna take this on the bridge.
It'll buckle the minute you pass the bank.
Nothing of the sort.
Don't try to put anything over on me.
I've known you too long.
I've beat you to it this time.
I wanna get this over with.
Shut up, and listen to me.
what can I say?
I put you out of the business.
You think I took your wife away.
It's the only square thing I can do.
Croak yourself?
I've gone through worse the past week.
I started this. I'm going through with it.
If you don't get off of this train, I'm gonna knock you cold and throw you off.
I'm sorry, Bill.
Aw, that we had to end up like this.
we've had scraps, plenty of them, ever since we was kids.
I didn't give you a fair deal on the last one.
Doubting you the way I did.
I could never get the straight of it, between you and Lily, I mean.
I guess it was because I was seeing too much red.
well, I got what was coming to me.
I stopped seeing what there was to see.
It's no time for talk.
I'm the guy that did it.
But I didn't mean to hurt you, God knows.
But there's one thing I didn't do, fella.
Lily's yours, and she's still yours, and, well, she'll always be yours.
You won't let me take the engine out?
No! well, it's the only...
Goodbye, Jack.
I guess I won't be seeing you again.
Do you wanna shake?
Have a little chew on me.
Getting a little bit closer.
what's the matter, Bill?
Jack! Jack!
That's my buddy...
Let me go, I tell you.
MAN: Don't let Haley see you.
BILL: Haley can kiss my hand if he don't like it.
Good morning, Mr. White.
WAITRESS: They're almost ready for you.
I ordered them the moment I saw the engine.
WAITRESS: Can I get you something?
Just a cup of coffee, please.
Gee, you're looking well.
It turned quite warm yesterday, didn't it?
At least, it did where I was.
Back home, I mean.
I guess maybe spring's here, all right.
Yes, that's one reason I came back.
The house has to be painted.
And there's some gardening to do and... well, there's a lot of things to be done, you know.
You gonna sell it?
Sell it?
No, I've come back here to live.
It won't be so lonesome with Peg-Leg next door.
Maybe you'll come over and see us sometime.
If you've got an hour or so you might come over and spade the backyard.
I'm gonna put in sweet peas again.
That's all I ever get from you, a lot of hard-luck stories.
I'll give you an assignment.
It'll be your last interview with the cashier.
Stew Smith!
Mr Conroy, give me a crack at that Schuyler story.
If you ever got into a drawing room, you'd step on a sliding rug.
Stew's the only man got brains enough for this.
- Scram! Did you find Stew?
- Did you look in the?
- First place I looked.
For crying out loud, where is that guy?
Go and dig him up.
Stew Smith!
Pray for me, Gallagher.
- Hold everything.
- Stew, your hands are shaking.
- You've been drinking again.
- Here they come.
- Stew Smith!
- Here they come.
- The boss is getting hoarse.
- That's the third one.
If I don't make that last one, a sob sister I know's gonna get a kick...
The screen?
Here they come. Gallagher!
- Look, I quit.
You're always picking on me.
Three hours to get those gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute.
Not as easy as it looks, is it?
No wonder you're batty.
Would it be imposing if I asked you to do a little work?
Just to sort of break the monotony?
- With me, you can always do business.
- Know what to do in a drawing room?
It's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Listen, we've got a tip.
The Schuyler family have finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
- Gloria Golden?
- Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register.
Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid?
- Right for the first time this year.
- It's only April.
I could write that without leaving the office.
And get us into a million-dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time.
Get a statement out of the old lady, the sister or the kid.
Any of them, but get it.
- Give me a voucher for the expenses.
All you need is carfare to Long Island.
And get a shave and a shine.
You're gonna have a tough time getting in there as it is.
I know those blue-noses.
Their ancestors refused to come on the Mayflower. They didn't want to rub elbows with tourists.
So they swam over.
Dexter Grayson, if you're a lawyer, get those letters back.
I keep telling you how difficult it is, Mrs Schuyler.
The last time I asked her, she made very uncouth noises with her mouth.
I don't know why you're making all this fuss.
I only sent six.
Why didn't you tell it to her instead of writing?
- I couldn't get her on the phone.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo.
- I found that out a long time ago.
- I should say.
At this rate, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Splendid, Mother.
Let's hop over to Monte Carlo.
- It's a great place to save a face.
- What is it, Smythe?
- Pardon me, madam. But what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Dexter, go out and tell those ruffians I have nothing to say.
You can't do that. Leave it to me.
I know how to handle reporters.
Get it over with.
We've decided to see the reporters.
The man from the Tribune first.
- Very good.
Some bicarbonate of soda.
Double-strength.
I know those newsmongers will upset me.
I anticipated it, madam.
The bicarbonate is ready.
Hey, Bingy, you'll find the silverware in the dining room.
Mr Grayson has decided to see you.
- The gentleman from the Tribune first.
- There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Hey, take it easy.
Listen, no use you hanging around here.
Read the Tribune, rewrite it and use it for your last edition.
Never make it.
It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
You might make an impression.
Put it on again.
Make up your mind, will you?
Ain't there a "bless you" in the crowd?
- You're the Tribune man?
- Fine newspaper, the Tribune.
- I should say.
- I knew your managing editor well.
Yale. '21, I believe.
We were classmates.
She got a cold?
I got him his job on the paper.
- One Tribune man to another.
Right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs Schuyler's attorney.
I won't hold that against you.
- But I'm over here to find out about...
But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
However, I've taken the trouble to prepare a little statement.
Here it is. Here.
So, you see how silly that rumour is.
It's all a lot of hooey.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
- Don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Well, so long, folks.
- So long.
- Bring in the other reporter.
Schuyler's the name, I presume?
My name's Smith, Stewart Smith.
No relation to John, Joe, Trade or Mark.
Of course, you can't have everything.
Nice set of Conrads you have there, Mrs Schuyler.
I was just glancing through this one.
- What's Michael tearing the paper for?
- Just a habit.
Mr Schuyler's a bit put out by all these rumours.
Rumours?
Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumour?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed.
- It has been settled out of court.
Gloria isn't exactly satisfied with the $20,000.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only 10,000!
And you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel.
So, you did give her $10,000!
And there are letters.
That takes it out of the rumour class.
We admit nothing.
However, I've a little statement all prepared.
- A statement? Good.
- I have it right here.
50 bucks, huh?
Don't you know you should never offer a newspaperman more than $2?
If you do, he'll think it's counterfeit.
I don't need $50.
As a matter of fact, I've got $50.
The man from the Tribune seemed satisfied.
Bingy?
Bingy would.
He never saw $50 before.
You could have bought him for six bits.
Funny thing about Bingy, the more he gets, the more he prints.
He looks stupid, doesn't he?
But, oh, how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
So ten grand was the amount you gave the gal?
Any other statement you folks would like to make?
- We have nothing more to say.
Nothing to worry about.
A little publicity never hurt anybody.
Dexter, have this person leave immediately.
- I think you'd better go.
- Go, huh? Wait a minute.
That's a great story:
"Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from the Schuyler mansion..."
Don't mind Mother.
- I don't mind her if you don't.
- Anne?
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Decent?
Why, Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
You're not going to print this silly thing?
Because my name's Schuyler, too, and I haven't done a thing.
But I'll have to suffer with Michael, and so will Mother.
Mother's suffering already.
As a special favour to me, you won't print that story, will you?
Lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in 60 seconds.
- May I use your telephone? - Certainly.
Right over there.
You're all right.
Beekman 1300.
That's an unlucky number.
You know that, don't you?
Hello, toots. Is Conroy in?
Let me have Conroy.
He isn't?
Try the washroom, will you?
Say, I interviewed a swell guy the other day. Einstein.
Swell guy.
A little eccentric, but a swell...
Doesn't wear any garters.
Neither do I, as a matter of fact.
What good are garters?
Conroy, this is Smith talking.
I'm up at the Schuylers.
No, I'm not having tea.
That is, not yet.
Is she beautiful?
Boss, her pictures don't do her justice.
If I were that guy, Ziegfeld, I...
Yes, you can see where her beauty comes from.
Keep your shirt on.
I'll come to that in a minute.
The Schuylers admit the story is true. Right.
They gave the gal 10,000 bucks.
But she's got some letters, and she's holding out for more dough.
It looks to me like she's going to get it.
No, I don't think I can get any pictures now.
I've met some rotters in my time, but you're the lowest excuse for a man I've ever had the misfortune to meet.
Well, if you feel that way about it, here's your nickel for the phone call.
Then she walked up to me, put her hand on my shoulder and said,
"Mr Smith, you wouldn't print that story, would you?"
No, I wouldn't print it.
You're going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer.
I've got to call on her this morning.
I must drop in and see the wench.
Her wounds need soothing.
For heaven's sake, are you completely bats? What for?
I thought that story was cold.
Sure, the story's cold, but I'm not.
I'm sizzling. Look.
- Came the dawn, came the dawn.
- And with it came love.
You've got to meet her.
She's it.
- And that.
- And those and them.
I've seen her pictures.
I don't think she's so hot.
You don't appreciate her.
Pictures don't do her justice. She's queenly.
She is queenly, and I know queens.
And has she got herself a nose!
And I know noses, too.
That little schnozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you.
And is it cute when she throws that little schnozzle to the high heavens!
- Of course, I haven't got a nose.
- Sure, you got a nose. But that's different.
Like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
I wouldn't be too hard on her.
I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
She's the real McCoy.
And the rest of us are truck horses.
There you go, talking like a woman.
- You're my pal, aren't you?
Then don't turn female on me.
Pay that check, will you?
I'll give it back to you sometime... maybe.
I go with Conrad in quest of my youth.
Fry those tomatoes, will you?
Now, Jeeves, was that nice?
Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves?
Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
- The name is Smythe.
- Smythe?
With a "y", huh?
What a small world.
Brothers under livery.
- As Smith to Smythe...
- Mrs Schuyler is not at home.
I waited outside until she went out.
She's a nice lady, she's all right, but we don't vibrate well together.
No one's at home, sir.
- Would you call this no one?
Mrs Schuyler left orders that if this person came again, I was to call the police.
Telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100.
Get some cops over and we'll play bridge.
- You may go, Smythe.
- Now, the lady said you may go.
Yesterday I had one of your books.
When I got outside, I realised I still had your book.
I thought I might as well take it home and read it.
This morning I put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
- That's considerate.
- I recommend you read that.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Perhaps it would be too heavy for you.
If you like something lighter, something with a touch of romance, listen to this.
"Adorable Babykins, does her miss her baby?
"Him sends his booful little sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses.
- "Bobo is so lonely."
I don't see how that trash can possibly concern me.
But you don't know who Bobo is. And who Babykins is.
Smythe will open the door.
Smythe will open...
But Bobo is your brother Michael.
And, of course, nobody would ever guess who Babykins is.
Where did you get those letters?
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
I suppose you're going to print them.
Give you another guess.
I don't need another guess.
- It's quite obvious.
- It's obvious, huh?
Will you step into the library?
I'll take a chance.
The Indians used to walk like this, except the squaw always walked in the back.
You know why that was?
That was in case of an attack from the front.
If the attack was from the rear, she had to depend upon her papoose.
Yes, papooses always had bows and arrows.
Of course, if she wasn't married, then she had to protect her own...
What country is this library in?
How about carfare back to the front door?
- What are the initials, Mr?
- Smith, Stewart Smith.
My friends all call me Stew.
It's an injustice, too, 'cause I hold my liquor all right.
Will 5,000 be enough?
- For the letters, of course.
You shouldn't do that, Miss Schuyler.
That's all right for your lawyer friend, but you shouldn't go around thinking you can buy people.
There are your letters.
Mother'll be so grateful, she'll want to kiss you.
Your mother will want to kiss me?
Give me back my letters.
That's the breaks I get.
It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.
You're a peculiar person.
The other day, I pleaded with you not to send in that story...
But that was news.
This is blackmail, and I don't like blackmail.
I won't even pretend you haven't done me a great favour.
Well, you could make this table a little less wide.
There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
I haven't had any lunch.
Got anything in the icebox?
After years of research, I finally discovered that I was the only guy in the world who hadn't written a play.
So, believe it or not, in my spare time, I'm now writing a play.
- I haven't figured out the plot yet.
But it's laid in a Siberian village.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Most ordinary guy in the world, me.
Only one thing wrong with me.
You don't wear garters.
No, that's just a symbol of my independence.
I know what's wrong.
That's what's wrong. I'm colour-blind.
I've been sitting here for a half-hour looking at you, and I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
You could do anything with me you wanted to.
Putty.
Just putty, that's me.
But getting back to those eyes of yours, would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see 'em?
Not if you're gonna lose any sleep about it.
Now, how would you like them?
Open like this?
Close them both.
Something tells me I'd better leave.
- Hello, Mrs Schuyler.
- Will you have a slug of tea?
- What is this person doing here?
I was just trying to decide the colour of Anne's eyes.
I can't tell whether they're blue or violet.
- What would you say?
- Don't say it, Mother. Please.
Mr Smith came here to do us a great favour.
Perhaps he will do me a great favour.
- Mother.
- It's all right, Anne.
I can take a hint. It's a little subtle, but I get it.
I'll explain to Mother.
The caviar was lovely, madam.
You must come over and see us sometime.
- Where were you yesterday?
- Stew and I went for a long ride.
Is there any finishing school we could send him to?
Yes, Sing Sing.
He's going to be a different person when I get through with him.
- Get through with him?
- It'll be an interesting experiment.
- To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player.
He has brains.
- But what about me, Anne?
- You? Don't go serious on me.
Hello, Natalie. Miss Montgomery, Mr Stewart Smith.
- Mrs Eames, Mrs and Mr Radcliff.
Who's Anne's new boyfriend?
If my ears don't deceive me, his name is Smith.
He can't be one of the brothers. He hasn't a beard on.
He must have something for Anne to have her clutches on him.
Anne, pinch me, will you?
Throw me out of here. Give me the air.
Haven't we been happy?
I know, but you should throw me out, because I begin to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
None of your ideas could be goofy, Stewart, if they concern me.
That you seem to have been able to stand for the last month.
I'm white, male and over 21.
I've never been in jail.
That is, not often.
And I prefer Scotch to bourbon.
I hate carrots. I hate peas.
I like black coffee and I hate garters.
I make 75 bucks a week, and I got 847 bucks in the bank.
And I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
That's because you're too far away.
Yeah, sure. I got a new dress.
New hat, too.
Well, I'll try and get Stew to come with me.
He's all right.
He thinks he's stuck on some society gal.
No, it won't last.
It better not last.
I'll be surprised, eh?
Well, listen, if there's any news in that sheet that I haven't thrown in the wastepaper basket, I'll eat it.
- Me? - Double-crossing hound!
Come here!
If you're gonna kick about those expenses...
- Do you call yourself a reporter?
- It has been alleged, yes.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it.
- So you've never been scooped?
- Not on my own beat, no.
Where were you when that happened?
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this?
Holy mackerel!
It's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured.
Marries one of our own reporters, and the Tribune beats us to it.
Get back to your desks. Go back to work.
Don't tell me you were drunk and don't remember.
- Or is it one of Bingy's snowstorms?
- It's true all right.
- Only we didn't want it to get in print.
I've acquired a new mother-in-law.
She wouldn't understand, so we were going to wait until she went to Europe.
What would I care?
You're still working for this paper.
Or are you? It's your business to get news.
You have a story in your lap and you let the Tribune scoop us, making a first-class, grade-A monkey out of me.
If it ever happens again, don't bother about coming back.
Thanks for your congratulations.
- How much is she really worth?
- Is she good-looking? Can't a guy get married without all this?
Anybody seen Gallagher?
Hello, Stew. I fooled you. You thought it was me.
- Hi, Joe. Hello, Stew. Congratulations!
- Have a drink on the house.
- Why, I'm gonna have a lot of drinks.
Well, Gallagher, old pal.
There you are.
What did you run away for?
- I didn't run away.
- You ran away.
- Aren't you going to congratulate me?
- I wish you all the luck in the world.
- We'll be happy.
- What's the matter with your eyes?
- Smoke. Joe, a little snifter.
Say, was I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that?
I don't know how I rate that.
Gosh, that is a swell girl.
I want you to meet her.
Me? She wouldn't want to meet me.
I'm just an old load of hay.
Thank you. We'll have a party at your house, a spaghetti party.
- Haven't had one in a long time.
- Not since you broke into society.
Remember the time I was serving spaghetti and dropped it on the floor?
When those mugs weren't looking, I served it to 'em anyway.
Anne would love that.
Your wife would walk up three flights to eat from paper plates?
Anne?
Oh, sure. Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now, get this.
Smith, that's the name.
My error.
Just because I'm married, no reason for that.
Ixnay, the ossbay.
Well, what's the Benedick looking for in the newspaper, his lost freedom?
Well, if it isn't old Fagin himself.
Gallagher and myself came over to do a little work on a story.
Joe, bring me a special.
- Isn't it swell about Stew's marriage?
Well, when are you quitting?
I'm not thinking of quitting.
I take it you don't have to work for a living any more, Mr Schuyler.
Now, get this, Conroy.
My name's Smith.
Always was Smith.
Always gonna be Smith.
Anne Schuyler's in the Blue Book.
You're not even in the phone book, sucker.
That doesn't make any difference, if they love each other.
He's like a giraffe marrying a monkey.
You'll never be anything but just the reporter that married the Schuylers' millions.
Stew Smith is dead and buried.
From now on, you'll be just Anne Schuyler's husband.
A rich wife's magnolia.
Smoke that without getting sick.
- That's ridiculous.
- Let me do the talking. Get this.
Anne Schuyler has got a lot of dough, all right.
I married her, all right.
But her dough and me?
No connection. - Just a bird in a gilded cage.
A bird in a gilded cage.
You've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids.
Anne and myself are gonna move downtown in a little flat.
We're gonna forget this social stuff and be known as Mr and Mrs Stew Smith.
- And live on your salary, I suppose.
- Live on my salary.
- Until I finish writing my play.
- What play?
- My play.
- About the Siberian bloodhound?
Siberian bloodhound?
No, it's been all rewritten.
- It's laid in Araby now.
- Sure. - Araby, my...
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey.
- Let me know when you're quitting.
For he's only a bird in a gilded cage
A beautiful sight to see
Tweet-tweet!
Go on, laugh, you hyena.
- Don't pay attention to him.
- I ain't paying no attention to him.
You think that guy can get me upset?
Not that mug. He's a tough mug.
Hard, cynical.
He doesn't know there's any fine things in life.
A guy can't step out without being called a magnolia.
Stew Smith, a magnolia!
Stew Smith is not gonna hang around and be any speakeasy rat.
Not me. I'm gonna step out and mean something in this world. Watch me.
I'm a lucky guy that I can even be near Anne Schuyler.
I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes and I know it.
Lucky. I'll say I'm lucky.
Don't you think I'm lucky?
- Sure, I think so.
- Sure you would, pal.
A bird in a gilded cage?
- How's her family gonna feel about it?
- Her family?
They'll be all right.
I'll bring them around. Gilded cage...
Besides, I ain't marrying her family.
Stew Smith, ha!
Gilded cage.
That mug.
- I don't know what you need me for.
- Stay right here.
Someday you'll be head of this family. Thank heaven I shan't be here.
I hope you never have a daughter who gives you gastritis.
- There's no use in getting excited.
- Oh, isn't there? Sit down.
- Smythe, some bicarbonate, quick.
- Double-strength.
Keep this up, you'll have a breakdown before you go to Europe.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family.
I can't imagine what made you do such a thing.
Of all things, a reporter!
A barbarian who lets his socks come down.
I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer.
Once he's away from that atmosphere and a man named Gallagher.
Drink hearty, Mother.
Well, what's to be done?
He's here now.
Nobody seems to want to do anything.
Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion.
- Do what about what?
- About what? Your marriage to Anne.
Oh, my marriage to Anne.
We don't want you to go to any trouble about that.
We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Young man, I want you to know that I object violently to this whole affair.
Mother, your attitude's perfectly ridiculous.
Stewart and I are married.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs Schuyler.
I'm really very sorry that you feel this way.
I was in hopes that you would like me.
I'm not the burglar that you think I am.
We're married. The thing to do is to kiss and make up, Mother.
- Stop calling me "Mother"!
- All right, Grandma.
This man's impossible.
Grayson, let's go where we can think.
You see what you've done to me?
Got it too?
Who won that round?
Your mother won that round.
That is, she got the last blow in.
I don't feel the way they do.
You're not as bad as everybody thinks.
Well, beginning to appreciate me, huh?
- Come upstairs. I'll give you a little...
- Sure, I'll be right up.
- He's all right.
I like him. - I'm glad.
He can bend.
Come here, baby.
I haven't seen you for three hours.
You're neglecting me already.
Something I ate, no doubt.
Egg marks the spot.
You ought to get some new ties.
I don't need any new ties.
I've got another tie.
I've got another one besides this one.
It's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it.
Know what?
It has a little weakness for gravy, and, once in a while, it leans toward ketchup.
That's only in its weaker moments.
When you move to my place, I'll show it to you.
- Yeah. It's great.
Of course, it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours.
But 'twill serve, milady, 'twill serve.
The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic, and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance, with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Don't you think it's silly to think of living there when we have this big house?
When we have...
You mean you'd like to have me live here in your house?
We can have the whole left wing and be by ourselves all the time.
We could have the whole left wing?
Would that be room enough for us?
Oh, darling, of course.
There are six rooms and two baths.
If that isn't enough, Mother'll give us the blue room.
Mother would give us the blue room?
You haven't a red room?
Well, bless her heart.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Six rooms and two baths and a blue room.
She would let us have the right wing if we needed it?
- But we don't need it, I'm sure.
- We won't need that.
Plenty of room.
Look, Anne. You're not serious about this, are you?
Of course I am.
- Let's get this settled.
- You have the cutest nose...
Never mind my nose.
What kind of a chump do you think I am, to live in your house, on your dough?
What do you think my friends would all say?
Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that.
A bird in a gilded cage, that's what I'd be.
Not me.
What would my friends say if they found me in a cheap flat?
- It isn't cheap. It's nice.
- Let's not talk about things like that now.
- I'll do anything you ask, but...
- I love that nose.
It's such a sweet nose.
Sweet or not, I'm not gonna live in your house.
You might as well get that straight.
You want me to be happy, don't you?
Then I'm not gonna live in it.
How do you like your bath, sir?
I like my bath, all right.
How do you like your bath?
- I'm your valet, sir.
Dawson is the name, sir.
- You're my what?
- Your valet.
I'll do that for you sometime.
What'd you say the name was?
Dawson, sir.
- Was I very drunk last night?
I must have been plastered if I hired a valet.
But you didn't engage me, sir.
Who did engage you, then?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
- Miss Schuyler...
I mean, Mrs Smith.
She engaged me this morning, sir.
So Mrs Smith engaged me a valet?
That's very nice of Mrs Smith to engage me a valet.
Say, you know, you're nice.
You're all right.
- You'd make a good wife.
- Thank you, sir. But not for me.
If anybody liked you.
You're a nice fellow. But I'm sorry, I don't need any valets today.
But indeed you do, sir, if you don't mind my saying so.
A gentleman's gentleman, as it were.
Someone to draw your bath, lay out your clothes, help to dress you.
It's really most essential, sir.
I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
- Quite, sir. - I appreciate your effort. But I don't need anybody to button my pants.
I've been buttoning them for 30 years.
I can button them with one hand.
- But, Mr Smith, please.
- Listen, you've got a nice face.
You wouldn't want anything to happen to your face?
- I beg your pardon?
- Outside. I think I understand, sir.
You mean you want me to go?
You caught on, didn't you?
See, you're nice and you're smart.
Go on, outside.
- That's a canary, sir.
That's a canary. Who brought that in here?
Canary, huh?
Go on, now. Get that out of here!
A bird in a gilded cage.
Get that thing out of here.
Dawson, see that Mr Smith's clothes go to the cleaners this morning.
Very good, madam.
- Who is this mug?
- I got a present.
I know you're gonna love 'em.
Couldn't be an automobile, could it?
Ain't that nice?
- Do you like 'em?
- Got my initials on 'em, too.
They're cute.
What do you do with them?
You wear them, of course, silly.
- I haven't worn these for years.
I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
I'll eat spinach for you.
I'll go to the dentist twice a year. I'll wash behind my ears for you.
But I will never wear garters
Oh, yes, you will, my dear Oh, yes, you will, my dear
You'll wear garters And you'll like it, too
Oh, no, I won't, my dear Oh, no, I won't, my dear
I'll wash behind the ears But, no, I won't, my dear
You'll eat spinach But you'll wear garters, too
Oh, you can't carry a tune You can't carry a tune
All you are good for Is to sit and spoon, spoon
- Oh, no, I won't wear garters
- Oh, yes, you will, too
- Of course it's real.
- Any diamonds?
Must have set him back at least six bits.
One can't wear those and be decent.
- You can if you belong to the 400.
- I wonder what number he is.
Come on, get out!
Didn't you ever see a guy with garters on?
- What does he wear them for?
- To hold his socks up?
Yes, that's it.
One's hose look horribly untidy when they hang loose-like.
Oh, my dear. They look ghastly.
They look ghastly.
Come on, get out of here!
Hey, Stew, your policeman.
Go on, beat it.
Go on, screw!
- Pardon me.
In your respective chapeaux and over your cauliflower ears.
- Hello, dear. - It's nearly six o'clock. You know how long it takes you to dress.
But the ambassador's coming at eight.
I'd like to see Miss Wilson.
- Whom shall I say, miss?
- Miss Gallagher of the Post.
Miss Gallagher of the Post.
Miss Gallagher? I'm Miss Wilson, Miss Schuyler's social secretary.
- I'm here in place of our social editor.
- Miss Ramsey telephoned me.
What would you like to have?
- A list of guests. That's the usual thing.
Would you like to take a look around?
Yes, thank you.
- Where is Mr Smith?
- Mr Smith? Oh, you mean Anne Schuyler's husband?
He's probably very tired.
He's had to meet these people personally tonight.
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him.
What is it you call him?
The Cinderella Man?
- There's the Spanish ambassador.
- He looks like one.
Miss Wilson, Mrs Smith would like to see you.
Make yourself at home for just a moment.
Mr Smith, I've read some of your plays, and I'd like an autograph.
Well, well, well! If it isn't my old pal!
Turn around.
Let's get a look at you.
Daughter of the slums, how'd you get out of the ghetto?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor.
- I want to see some life in the raw.
- Life in the raw?
- We ain't got no raw life up here.
- I'll have to go someplace else.
Maybe some well-done butterflies, slightly fried pansies, or, better still, stuffed shirts.
And every one of them will give you a good, stiff pain in the neck.
Who's been tying your tie lately?
It looks rotten.
Gallagher, do you look good!
What have you done to yourself?
What'd you do to that hair?
And where did you get that dress?
- I dyed one and washed the other.
- You dyed one and washed other?
You certainly look good.
Don't turn around, but a very beautiful girl up there seems to be staring at us.
- Staring at us?
- My mistake. She's glaring.
Must be my wife.
Hi, Anne. Don't go away, because I'm gonna bring a friend up I want you to meet.
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life.
- This is Gallagher.
- Gallagher?
My pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
- Gallagher, Mrs Smith. - How do you do?
You failed to mention that Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Gallagher? You failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
- That's funny.
Isn't that funny?
- Yes, isn't it?
We never look at Gallagher as a girl.
What do you look upon her as?
Down at the office, we always just look at...
Gallagher, that's all. They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you need.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once.
- Goodbye, Mrs Smith.
- Goodbye, Miss Gallagher. Goodbye, Stew.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne.
After all, Gallagher's my friend.
The least you can do is be courteous to her.
- I thought I was very charming.
That's a lot of hooey.
- I'll go and apologise.
- Stewart, please.
I'm sorry.
Really, I am sorry.
That's all right. Forget it.
As far as she's concerned, I'm part of the hired help.
Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.
It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
- Hello, Meadows.
- Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I wanna see Stew Smith.
Excuse me. I mean, Mr Smith.
Pardon me, Mr Smith is engaged.
- We have a reception here...
- A party?
Great. Jolly times and merry pranks, that's me.
Beautiful pair of shoulders.
If you don't, my whole family's gonna die. I'll tell Mr Smith at once, sir.
I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
Pardon me, sir, but I've heard that one before.
Excuse me. Want to be sure he doesn't take away any of the vases.
Well, well, well. So my little pal Gallagher's a gal, huh?
Just to give you an idea that I know how to treat a gal.
Get fresh with me and I'll sock you in that little nose of yours.
What's the matter, Bingy?
A little clumsy to get in your pocket?
I was just looking.
Pretty. I was looking for the price tag.
- What do you want?
- Nothing. I wanted to see how the newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Would you like to have me turn around for you?
Oh, boy, I'd love it.
- How's that?
- Not bad. Not good, but not bad.
You ought to be able to fool almost anybody.
Have you seen enough, or would you like a photograph?
A photograph?
What's the matter? Hasn't Mama had you done in oils yet?
Just a gigolo... Now, get this, mug!
You've got the kind of chin I'd just love to touch.
If you don't get out of here, I'm gonna hang one right on it.
Take it easy, Dempsey.
Just relax. Relax and open your pores.
I bring a message from Garcia.
The boss sent me over to offer you a job.
- He wants you to write a daily column.
- Go on.
You can write your own ticket.
150 bucks a week.
- What's the catch?
- No catch.
This is on the up-and-up.
All you have to do is just sign the article:
"By Anne Schuyler's husband."
Well, how does the old Cinderella Man feel about that?
Well bowled, sir.
Very neat.
That's what I think of it, Bingy.
- Smythe, the gentleman's leaving.
Didn't I tell you he'd be marvellous?
Everybody thought he was so charming.
I was worried he'd knock something over.
I must have acted like an idiot.
What does it say about the reception last night?
Blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
You're behaving like who you're married to.
You don't have anything to complain about.
He was all right last night, wasn't he?
I told you not to worry about him.
The man was ill or something.
- Mother!
- Look! The front page!
I felt it in my bones.
Did you see the papers? "Cinderella Man grows hair on chest."
This is the most terrible publicity...
Don't you think I know it?
Smith, send for Mr Smythe.
- Smythe, send for Mr Smith.
"Cinderella Man grows hair on chest."
"'I wear the pants,' says Anne Schuyler's husband."
Maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?
Ever get a feeling there was somebody else in the room with you?
- Have you seen this?
- The worm.
- Pardon? - A worm. I'll step on him.
To engage in a cheap, common brawl in my own home.
"I wear the pants." Not even the "trousers"!
I tried to stop the evening papers.
It's useless.
- Quit trying to stop anybody. - You might deny it.
The more you deny, the more they print.
Let them alone. - Thing to do is keep your trap shut.
- Trap shut?
Certainly.
I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.
- What are you crying about?
- Is it true?
Did you really say it?
Sure, I said it.
I didn't say it for publication, though.
- You struck him in our house?
- I struck him in your house.
I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
- What do you expect them to call you?
- That's the 14th crack you've made.
I'm keeping count.
When they get to 20, I'll sock you in the nose. - In fact, I ought to do it now.
- Are you going to watch him insult us?
- Haven't you any decency left?
- Why doesn't Dexter show decency?
You might show some, too.
What do you expect when he's called such names?
I'm glad you hit that reporter.
He deserved it. All right.
It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler.
Go on, beat it, shadow.
Cinderella Man.
Pardon me, ma'am.
They've phoned from the mayor's reception to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
- Are the cars ready?
- They've been ready for half an hour.
I hope I don't have to make any speeches.
You can't disappoint all those women.
It isn't every day they get to see a famous round-the-world flyer.
But they scare me to death.
This is the fourth dinner this week.
I'm running out of material.
- There's always too many people around.
- It's late. What are we waiting for?
- You're waiting for my husband.
I'll run up and see what that slowpoke's doing.
Stewart, we're all waiting for you.
- Where's your valet?
- I poisoned him. Stop trying to be funny and get ready, will you?
- I'm not going.
- What are you talking about?
- What am I going to tell those people?
- Tell them anything.
Tell them I'm not going.
Tell them I'm not at home.
Would you tell me why you're not going?
I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates.
I don't like them.
They bore me.
- They give me the jitters.
- They're my friends. They still give me the jitters.
Well, are you going or aren't you?
- Come here.
- Look out for my lipstick.
Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves.
- Think of the fun we'll have.
We'll sneak down, get in the valet's Ford.
- Will you stop being silly?
- No, I'll tell you what.
- I'll introduce you to all my gang.
- I don't want to meet your gang.
I don't mean the newspaper fellas.
Another gang I know.
You'd love them.
They're writers and musicians and artists.
Great crowd.
People who are worthwhile.
Meaning that my friends aren't worthwhile?
- They're all right.
- That's what you mean.
You've made that clear to me, and I'm sick and tired of it.
I've given you party after party, taken you into the best homes, introduced you to people of importance.
Are you grateful?
No. You insult them and act like a boor.
I'm tired of making excuses for the things you've done.
It's just as well you're not coming.
Maybe I can enjoy myself without having to worry about what you're going to do.
And that, my friend, is what is known as society belle telling ex star newspaper reporter to go to...
How have you been, Mr Smith?
Did you call, sir?
Come on, Smythe. Talk to me, will you?
I'm going nuts! I'm going nuts in this house!
This big...
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Look, come out here. Come on, what's the matter with you?
- Do you hear something?
- Yes, sir.
- You try it. - Me, sir?
No. Give it more volume.
No, that's enough.
I just wanted to give you an idea.
- Yes. - Have you looked in the closets?
- Yes, sir. - Found no skeletons?
- No, sir. It's haunted just the same.
Here.
What do you do when you're not carrying those... double-strength?
Well, sir, I putter.
When you're alone and you want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
Putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
No, sir. I putter with my hands.
Well, isn't that nice?
You just go right ahead with your...
Well, sir, I'll show you.
- That's puttering, sir.
That's? Well, well, well.
It's all right if you like it, I guess.
Anybody can do that?
Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Some people are born and never would become putterers?
- Yes. - Wouldn't that be tragic?
Not to know that you could never be a putterer?
How about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it that someday I might be a putterer?
You, sir?
You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer.
If I can't be a good putterer, there's...
What makes you think I couldn't?
Well, sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease.
A person with a problem could never be a putterer.
For instance, a fish can putter in water but not on land, because he'd be out of place.
An eagle can putter around rugged mountaintops but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy.
Now, sir, if you'll pardon me, with all respect, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
- A bird in a gilded cage?
- Yes, sir. That's all I want to know.
Hello, Gallagher?
Hello, old pal.
How are you, old pal?
Hello, Stew.
I'm pretty good.
Can't complain. How's our gentleman of leisure?
On the coast of Norway and I can't get out.
Will you come get me out?
Oh, your play.
"Act 1, Scene 1.
Coast of Norway." And then a lot of blanks.
Don't be silly.
All right.
If you feel like you need a chaperone, call up Hank. You'll find him at Joe's, no doubt.
Hank would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard.
Sure he would. I knew I could depend on you.
Snap it up, will you?
Smythe, I'll get this.
I'm expecting some friends.
Well, Gallagher!
Come in. I'm glad to see you.
- Hank, how are you?
- Kind of thirsty.
- Come in.
I'll get you a drink.
- You remember Joe?
I invited him to bend an elbow with us.
- It's all right.
Bring him in. - Come on, Joe.
- Hello, Joe.
- Johnson's outside.
Mind if he comes in and dips the beak?
- Bring him in.
The more the merrier.
- Come on.
Johnson.
Glad to see you.
Come in.
Wait a minute.
I got two of the boys I brought along.
You brought two?
Bring them in. - What's the difference?
Hello, boys.
Come in. How are you?
- I'm sorry nobody could come.
- Well, my old pal! If it isn't Sweetheart!
Why didn't you bring your family with you?
The rest had to do the morning edition.
They'll be down later.
It'll be lonesome without them.
Smythe, give them a drink.
And find out what the boys in the back room want.
Don't be holding out on us.
We're willing to help you.
It isn't done, gentlemen!
It isn't done, I say. Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
I asked Hank and Hank did the rest.
Hank brought them?
We'll give them a drink and throw them out.
How's that? Holy...
- Is there a green elephant there?
- No, this is just little Bingy Baker.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends.
Big Chief very sorry.
Show how sorry, will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shine.
Excuse me.
I wouldn't miss this for...
Fire-water, all right.
That's all thrashed out.
I'm certainly glad you're not really sore.
You know our racket.
News is news. Sure, it's all right.
That was a great story. I wish I'd printed it.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I?
That was that hairy-chest story.
You raised it up to the chin, I see.
Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Smythe. Give them one drink, throw them out.
- Yes, sir. - We're gonna give him one.
I should sock you in that funny nose.
- Yes, and I'd love it.
- Sure you'd love it.
Just been able to get off of that Norway coast so far.
A street in Old Madrid."
You're not getting your play done, but you're covering territory.
Haven't I covered some territory?
I feel like I've been on a Cook's tour.
Have you ever been to Old Madrid?
- Been where? - Old Madrid.
I've never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
- I'll draw on my imagination, I suppose.
- Did Conrad draw on his?
- Did who?
- Conrad. - What do you know about Conrad?
- Isn't he the one you always yell about?
- You look cute.
Isn't he the one that only writes about the things he knows about?
Then write about something you know.
About yourself and Anne.
The poor boy that marries a rich girl.
Now, there's a swell theme.
Gee, that's an idea there, Gallagher.
That's an idea there.
She'd make a beautiful heroine.
And there's her mother.
What a character that old dame would make with her double-strengths.
Their lawyer friend'd make a great villain.
- And there's you.
- What could I be?
You could be something.
Come on, scram.
We got an idea.
Let's get this set.
It's a great idea. Great idea for a play.
Get me a cigarette, will you?
Let's not lose this.
- Thanks. Now, let's see.
How would I start?
Hey, pal, how would you start?
Smythe, you're a slave.
What's the difference between a king and a butler?
Say, you can't come in here.
This is a private party.
My old classmate from Harvard.
Whoopee! Harvard, '98.
Hello, Mama!
- And I know who's the cause of it all.
- Friends of mine.
Very li...
- Literary people.
- He's drunk. You've been drinking.
Double-strength.
- Very drunk.
Where is Mr Smith?
Well, for crying out loud, I don't know.
If we could only get a great scene, a tremendously emotional scene.
Something to ring the hearts out of the public, to bring the curtain down in the second act.
- Couldn't dig one out of your hat?
- Afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
The boy's wearing his white spats and going to pink teas.
- The Frau enters.
How's that?
- Very good. If we can just get where we...
- What does what mean?
Oh, that mob? I got so interested in the play, I forgot all about 'em.
And we got a play, Anne.
Have we got a play!
Most of it's Gallagher's.
Her brain just snaps like that all the time.
I'm not interested in the way her brain snaps.
- I think I'd better go.
- I think you should.
What's the idea?
I want these people to leave immediately.
Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Unreasonable? Have you any idea what the place looks like?
Do you expect me to let this house turn into a cheap bar?
Don't get excited.
Perhaps the boys have had too much to drink.
I'll go down and throw them out.
That's no reason for you to take this attitude.
I have a right to invite my friends to my house, haven't I?
I kind of forgot myself for a moment there.
That's what I call "getting me told", isn't it?
I suppose I've been boarding out this last year.
I don't like your boarding house, lady.
And if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Stewart.
I should have done it long ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it.
I have to try to make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning.
- No more!
- You can't walk out of here like this.
Who's gonna stop me?
I'd like to see somebody stop me.
You think I'm gonna stick around to look at this mausoleum?
Not on your life. You're gonna make no stuffed shirt out of me.
- What do you think of that?
- What's going on? Who's this woman?
- Joan of Arc.
- The man's insane!
Sure I'm insane.
But I got some good news for you.
This magnolia is leaving your sweet-smelling vanilla joint.
This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on.
That's what's known as telling the mother-in-law.
You've done nothing but watch me ever since I've been here.
Treated me like a thug. Watched me like a hawk.
Mistrusted me. When I leave, she counts the silverware.
- Fine.
I don't blame her. I'm out of my own crowd.
Should have had better sense. - I'll stay in my own back yard.
- You're acting like a child.
I'm a child.
Have it any way you want. I'm going to my apartment where I should have lived.
But I listen to you and move here.
If you wanna live with me, that's OK.
But the sign will say "Mr Stew Smith". You have to be Mrs Stew Smith or there's nothing doing.
No more Anne Schuyler's husband.
Here's some more news for you.
Take your red room, your green room, your left wing, your right wing.
You know what you can do with them!
Pardon me, could you spare a dime for a cup of coffee?
Coffee? How'd you like to be the Knight of the Garter?
- No, just coffee.
Entertain the gentleman.
There you are.
With those, you can eat for a couple of months.
How about the socks?
She'll see it your way.
I'm not worrying about her.
I'm worrying about that second-act curtain.
You're a first-class chump.
You just staged a scene that'd play like a million.
That declaration of independence for the second-act curtain?
It's an idea.
How do you expect me to bring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It'll be ready soon.
If you can't get my breakfast ready on time, get yourself another job.
- Sorry, boss.
- Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast.
Hello, Smith. - Holy jumping swordfish.
- I suppose you know why I came?
I've no idea, unless some of the silverware's missing.
No. Don't be absurd, Smith.
If I'd known you were coming, I'd have thrown you up a waffle.
I don't eat waffles.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Listen, Grayson, I've got $106.75 in the bank.
Anne can have that, but I'm spending it awful fast.
Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
We would like to know how much you want to...
Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
- That's putting it crudely...
- Remember about that 20th crack?
You've just made it.
Before you go unconscious, get this through your nut.
When you don't know anything.
Your natural state.
Some people, you can't buy their self-respect.
I'm one of those guys.
- We just thought...
- Let me do the thinking.
I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now.
I was too poor to get a wedding present, so I'll give her a divorce.
Stand up. And now for that 20th crack.
The Schuyler lawyer.
He just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
What was the idea he gave you?
Swell idea. How's this?
The lawyer comes to see the kid to talk over the divorce.
They insult the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony.
The kid gets sore, socks the lawyer and throws him out.
How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
From now on, the play will be easy.
Bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
You think I'm gonna let that guy go back to his wife?
He's got to go to the other gal.
Little O'Brien girl, of course.
The one you suggested in the story.
You can't make a sudden change like that.
You gonna tell me how to write a play?
There's nothing sudden about that.
He's always loved the girl.
But he was such a sap, he didn't have sense enough to tell her.
That's all right.
We can fix that.
He'll go to her and...
Here, I'll show you. He'll go to the little O'Brien gal and say...
In some pretty words, something that you can write, he'll say, " Darling, I'm sorry.
"I've been a fool.
I've always loved you, only I didn't see it.
"As quick as I can get a divorce from my wife, I want you to marry me."
She'll look at him and then she'll say, "Yeah."
And then they'll embrace, or something like that.
Then he'll kiss her or something.
What's the matter, Gallagher?
Larry, give me one of those empty jars.
Fill them up, will you?
Read all about it!
Give us a swig.
- Hello, Tommy.
Can grease?
Give us a little kiss.
That's what you get for fooling with women.
Hey, little boy, stop.
Stop, I say! Stop that!
Officer, get those boys.
Don't let them escape!
If I get a hold of you...
Matt, look.
That ain't fair, Tom.
- What do you care? It's only a girl.
- She's my sister, ain't she?
What difference does that make?
Help me up, Matt.
Leave her alone. She's doing fine.
That's the way to learn.
That's just like you, Tom Powers.
You're the meanest boy in town.
He is not. He give you his skates, didn't he?
I believe he did it just so he could play that trick on me.
- I'm gonna tell your brother Mike.
- Go ahead and tell him. Here he comes now.
You'll help me, won't you, Mike?
- Where'd you get the skates, Molly?
- Tom gave them to me.
Tom did? Where'd you get them, Tom?
He got them from a kid who owed him some money.
I'll bet you stole them, Tom.
Give them back, Molly.
Why don't you mind your own business?
Nobody asked you to put your two cents in.
Here, Tom. I don't want them if you stole them.
- So you're getting like sissy Mike, too.
- Take them, Tom.
You ain't so darn good. Your old man swipes pigeons.
Tom Powers, he does not!
You're a big liar.
He's in jail. They don't put people there for nothing.
Everybody who belongs there, ain't there.
That's where you'll be someday, Tom Powers.
I ain't there yet. If I do go, it won't be for swiping pigeons.
Tell him you were only kidding, Tom.
How do you want them this time: up or down?
Three for me, too.
Three skins.
- Hello there.
- How's it going?
Hit you. There you are.
- Hit me again.
- Hit you.
There's one.
Hit you again.
Hey, Putty Nose.
All right. I'll be back in a minute, boys.
Hello, boys.
- We've got something.
- Really? Fine.
I'll bet you a nickel.
- Where'd you get them?
- Wentworth Avenue.
How much are they worth?
Just cheap watches.
- Cheap watches?
$1 apiece. - Yeah, and there's six of them, too.
I don't know what I can do with them. They're hot.
Come on. Quit stalling, Putty Nose.
You know how to sell them.
You're too smart.
- I'll see what I can do with them.
- How much do we get?
What do you say to 50 cents for each of them?
- 50 cents?
- I ain't cheating you.
That's a good price.
I have to take all the risk, and maybe I can't sell them at all.
Give us the 50 cents.
You know old Putty Nose always plays on the square with you, don't you?
- This is only two bits.
- Yeah, and this is only a nickel.
- My mistake.
- Yeah.
All right.
You both owe me a month's dues to the club, don't you?
- That's right, Tom.
- So we're calling that square, see?
- That's all right, isn't it?
You've done a good stroke of business.
And if you find anything more... you'll just remember old Putty Nose, won't you?
Let's scram.
What do we want with a couple of young squirts like them for?
They ain't gonna be so bad.
They won't expect much of a cut.
- Hey there, Tom.
- Hello, Putty Nose.
Are you alone?
I'm always alone when I'm with Matt.
You looking for a sock on the button?
I was afraid you might have brought Mike with you.
That sucker.
He's too busy going to school.
He's learning how to be poor.
Ain't he working on the streetcars anymore?
Sure.
He's a ding-ding in the daytime, goes to school at night.
What do you want us for, Putty?
Something sweet.
Remember how I always said... when I got something good, I'd cut you in?
Now, Dutch here knows the whole layout.
We've been casing the joint for a whole week.
- How about the cops?
- You ain't afraid of cops.
There ain't gonna be no trouble... and if there is, I promise you that I'll protect you.
Now, Limpy here will be lookout.
The place is dead at night, anyhow.
Well, are you on?
- We ain't never done nothing so big.
- "Big" is right.
I'm giving you a break, like I promised.
Furs is worth plenty nowadays.
How about you, Tom?
- It's kind of new stuff for me.
- You gotta grow up sometime.
Wait a minute.
Christmas present from Santa Claus.
With best wishes for a prosperous new year.
- I'm scared stiff.
- Come on, ain't nothing to be scared of.
Is that so?
Look at you, you're shaking yourself.
Take it off me, will you?
You tried to get away, did you?
They got Limpy Larry.
Stop there!
- Where's that big loony?
- Where's Putty?
We knocked off a...
Yeah, I know all about it.
Putty Nose beat it.
You better lay low for a while.
The heat's on.
But Putty Nose got us into this. He promised to see us through.
Why, that dirty, no-good, yellow-bellied stool.
I'm gonna give it to him right in the head the first time I see him.
Yeah?
You and who else?
My Larry.
He was a good boy.
Larry got what he asked for.
He was a no-good boy.
My Larry was a good boy.
He got into bad company, that's all.
Come here, Tommy boy.
I'm so glad you came, Tommy.
Mrs. Dalton will be pleased to see some of Larry's nicer friends.
"U.S. declares war." Read all about it!
Wait a minute, Tom. Here comes Mike.
Read all about it. You should come on home with me, Molly.
I don't know just how to tell Mom.
All right, Mike.
That sister of yours ain't getting any bargain in Mike.
How come he ain't working?
I guess he got fired for snatching too many nickels.
- They look like something's happened.
- Come on, we gotta see Paddy.
You don't need to stall with Paddy Ryan, Tom.
I've been watching you ever since you bought your first drink from me.
You see, Paddy, it's like this.
We delivered some cigars today.
Must be worth about $2,500.
Took them to a place on 63rd and was told to put them in the back.
- We could lift them easy tonight.
- But we don't know what to do with them.
You sell cigars, don't you?
Not that kind.
Can't afford it.
I've got my own system, boys, but being a fence ain't part of it.
- We thought maybe you know somebody.
You might take them there.
- I'll call up and say you're coming.
- Thanks, Paddy.
If you get in a jam, give me a ring.
You'll find out Paddy Ryan's your friend.
Thanks, Paddy.
Why do you want to front for us?
We ain't never done nothing for you.
Maybe not.
But I may need a friend myself sometime.
I'm older than you... and I've learned that nobody can do much without somebody else.
Remember this, boys: You gotta have friends.
I've been watching and hearing about you, and I've been worried.
I was worried when you got mixed up with that two-timer Putty Nose.
Such guys are dangerous.
I'm glad you come to me.
As far as I'm concerned, there's only two kinds of people:
right and wrong.
Now, I think you're right.
You'll find that I am, unless you cross me.
That's swell.
Hello, Ma.
Tommy boy.
You won't leave me, will you, Tommy?
You're all I've got left now, Tommy boy.
What's the matter, Ma?
Mike's enlisted.
Enlisted?
In the Army?
- In the Marines.
- But you won't go, Tommy.
Promise me you won't go.
You're just a baby.
Now, listen, Ma...
If your pa was alive, I wouldn't care so much.
Promise me, Tommy.
I won't go, Ma.
When's he going?
As soon as he gets his call.
He's up packing now.
Go up and see him, Tommy.
We ought to be very proud of him.
I suppose you've heard.
Yeah. Kind of rushing it, ain't you?
Well, Tom, when your country needs you, she needs you.
I suppose you think I ought to go, too.
Maybe it was selfish of me, Tom... but somebody's got to stay here and take care of Ma.
You earn more money than I do, and they'd have called me first anyway.
- You always did get all the breaks.
- Don't take it like that, Tom.
You've got to be the man of the family now.
And while we're on the subject, I wish you'd try to stay home a little more.
- I gotta work, ain't I?
Listen, I was in a place today, and I heard somebody say something.
- Well, they were saying...
It seemed as though they were pointing a finger at you and Matt.
Who was? What rat would say anything about me...
Now take it easy.
You're always hearing things.
You'll get too much in your nose someday and wonder how you got it.
For crying out loud, I heard some guys talking about you... saying you were in on some crooked work.
What am I supposed to do?
You ain't asking me, you're telling me.
And I don't know a thing, see?
All I've got to say is that you've got a good job now.
You don't need these rats you're running with.
You want me to go to night school and read poems.
I've been hearing a few things myself.
- There's nothing to hear about me.
- That's all you know. You ain't so smart. Books don't hide everything.
- You're a liar. You're covering up.
- Covering up for what?
For you? - You're nothing but a sneak thief.
- What did you say?
You heard me, a petty larceny sneak thief.
Robbing the streetcar company.
Don't you think that booze ain't gonna be valuable.
I heard today that alcohol's gone to $30 a gallon.
The real McCoy's hard to get.
All you gotta do when you deliver a good shipment... is size up the layout and let me know.
I can use some of it.
I know two or three others that'll buy all that I can't handle.
It means real dough, a three-way split.
I said we'd get together sometime, didn't I?
Well, the time has come now.
Grab the rope.
One jerk to start, and two to stop.
Thanks, Hymie.
- Are you satisfied?
- I'll say.
Pretty soft, wasn't it?
How do you like playing with Paddy?
- I wonder what to do with so much dough.
- You ain't started.
I'll make big shots out of you yet.
- Anything you say goes for me, Paddy.
And here's to us.
31.5 inches.
Don't forget, plenty of room in there.
Sir. Here's where you need the room.
Such a muscle.
Make it snappy or you'll find out what it's for.
Let's get out of here.
22.5 inches.
Did you read about that big robbery at the booze warehouse?
42.5 inches.
- Right under their very noses.
- Yeah, a guy was just telling me about it.
33.5 inches.
If those men get away with that, they'll be rich for life.
37.5 inches.
Did you read what it said in the papers?
Why don't you two mugs get an adding machine?
All through now, gentlemen.
Don't forget what I told you. Plenty of room there.
Yeah, and remember: six buttons.
Be careful, Matt, or you're going to cut the nose right off of you.
- lf it ain't Mr. Tom and Mr. Matt.
- Hello, George. How's business?
- Big night.
Hey, stoop, that's got gears!
It ain't no Ford!
Mr. Powers, Mr. Doyle.
Alone as usual?
I am, but Matt's all fixed up.
He's got me with him. The night's young yet. - You'll wind up with something.
- Yeah, with the morning paper.
- Couple of lightweights.
- Yeah, flat tires.
Why don't you send them home to their mothers?
- They're no good to the joint anymore.
- And the ladies, too?
How about something with ice in it?
Well, we're with friends.
Hello, baby.
- What are you going to have?
- Anything you say, big boy.
You're a swell dish.
I think I'm going to go for you.
- Look at what I got measured for.
- I don't even know you're here.
Come on.
Then it's a deal?
If you can assure me my name will be protected.
You'll be protected all over the place.
You can take off those clothes.
You got new jobs.
First, meet Mr. Leehman.
These are the two lads I was telling you about.
How do you like the brewery business?
- We don't know nothing about it.
- You will.
You're in it now.
Mr. Leehman and I got it all fixed.
Mr. Leehman owns that big brewery over on Union Avenue.
- But that's been closed since...
- Yeah. It's going to open up.
You spoke of a rather remarkable man from the West Side.
Nails Nathan.
- Paddy, is Nails throwing in with us?
- He'll be here any minute.
I don't believe I'm acquainted with the gentleman.
Then you're the only man in town that ain't.
At least everybody's heard of him, boys.
Believe me, Mr. Leehman, when Nails and his mob start on a job... it's already done.
That Schemer Burns' crowd tries to muscle in on us... I pity them.
You understand that my desire is merely to furnish a better grade of beer... than the working man can now obtain... - under the present, unfortunate...
And again in your hat, mister. I've heard that north wind blow before.
If you're in this, you're in for the coins, same as the rest of us.
- Gentlemen, meet Nails Nathan.
- Born Samuel.
Tom Powers, glad to know you.
And you're Matt Doyle.
- How are you? Sit down, fellas.
Know all about you. Paddy has been talking.
Meet Mr. Leehman, Nails.
Tickled pink.
Don't take offense at anything I say, Mr. Leehman.
If we're in this racket together, we got to keep the cheaters off, right?
My name is not to appear...
Don't worry. We won't use it in our advertising.
Paddy, the mob's all ready by the time you can open.
Got some swell routes laid out for you, and the stock's all marked.
You mean, you have the customers all signed up?
- Signed up?
Signed up or sealed up.
Tom and Matt here is the official signers and sealers.
- The trouble squad. - And if they need any help...
Nails has got some pretty handy boys with their gloves all oiled.
Dear me, I'm afraid this means...
It means they buy our beer or they don't buy any beer.
All right, Dutch, get going.
And don't take any back talk from those speakies.
Tell them, "Here's the beer you ordered." If they doubt you, call Matt and Tom.
All right, Matt, Tom, get going.
- Hello, Steve. How's business?
- Business?
Business is on the bum.
That's with telling us you only took two kegs of beer last trip... - but now you don't want any at all.
- Business is on the bum.
Give us a couple of beers. That'll help a little.
- That ain't our beer.
- Where'd you get this slop?
It's good, ain't it? And it's cheaper than yours.
How much you paying for this stuff?
- Two bits a glass.
Screw.
You can sell ours for the same price.
Get your hands off that!
Somebody's got to protect your customers.
What can I do? I can't help it if I have to buy from Schemer Burns. - They tell me the same thing that you do.
- You're yellow.
Please, you ain't gonna slug me, are you?
Maybe not today.
But I'm telling you this for the last time.
When Dutch comes, he will leave some beer. You're going to take it and kick in with the dough.
If you don't, somebody will come and kick your teeth out one at a time.
You'll be needing some right away.
How many should we leave?
- Two kegs.
- You hear that, Dutch?
Bring in five kegs.
"Mr. and Mrs. Patrick J. Ryan."
"Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Grogan."
"Welcome home, Michael Powers."
"Samuel Nathan"?
Nails Nathan.
One of Tom's new friends.
What's Tom doing now, Pat?
Mother said something about a political job.
He and Matt have been running around... with a couple of girls at the Washington Arms Hotel.
Now, the worst part of it all is that he's been lying to his mother.
He's leaving her think that he's made an honest success.
Why, sure it's only a question of time when he's going to be caught.
And then he'll be after breaking her poor heart.
But what's he doing? Beer.
Bootleg.
He's one of Paddy Ryan's gang.
Sure, they stop at nothing.
You either take their beer, or they put you on the spot.
I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business.
Why, only last week...
That's nice of you, Tommy... but I don't think Mike will be able to drink any.
It's the best beer in town.
It'll do him good.
Dinner's all ready, Michael.
- Shall I help you in?
- No, Mother. I can make it.
I'll be getting along.
I'll see you all later.
How's the meat, Mikey?
Fine, Ma.
I wish you'd eat more.
Try some of this cabbage.
I've had plenty, Ma.
Say, we haven't drunk to your health yet.
This is a swell celebration.
There you are, Mike.
- That's enough for you, Ma.
- Put a head on that, will you?
Miss Powers.
Well, here's to you, Mike.
Why don't you drink, Mike?
Come on, it's only beer.
I don't want any, Matt.
What's eating you?
I'm not interfering with your drinking.
If you want to drink it, go on.
If I don't want to, I don't have to.
So beer ain't good enough for you?
You think I'd care if it was just beer in that keg?
I know what's in it. I know what you've been doing... how you got those clothes and those new cars.
You've been telling Ma you're in politics, that you're on the city payroll.
Pat Burke told me everything.
You murderers!
There's not only beer in that keg, there's beer and blood.
The blood of men!
You ain't changed a bit.
Besides, your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it.
You didn't get them medals for holding hands with Germans.
Please, he ain't himself.
He don't know what he's talking about.
This trip's been too much for the poor soul.
Lord have pity on him.
Please, Tommy.
Let's get out of here before I go screwy, too.
Don't go away, Tommy.
You can send my clothes to the Washington Arms Hotel.
Get up, lazybones.
What are you gonna do, sleep all day?
Button up.
I can sleep as long as I like.
That's a fine way to talk to me after I cooked this lovely breakfast for you.
With my own lily-white hands.
Lake View 8515.
- Hello, is Tom there?
I just called his apartment. They said he stepped across the hall for breakfast.
Tom, it's for you.
- Nails Nathan.
- Hello, kid.
- What's the matter, kid?
- Nothing.
Only the dame's beginning to get on my nerves, that's all.
Listen, I'm getting fed up on these rubber checks bouncing in.
We're laying down good beer and getting nothing but a lot of bum paper.
I got one this morning for $1,200 from that Pete over on Kedzie Avenue.
Get over there.
I want that dough.
Cash or his heart.
If you can't bring in one, bring in the other.
I'll bring you both.
Leave it to me, kid.
Come on in, Matt. Shake a leg.
Nails wants us to do him a favor.
It's all ready, Tom.
- Ain't you got a drink in the house?
- Not before breakfast, dear.
I didn't ask you for any lip. - I asked you if you got a drink.
- I know, Tom... - but I wish...
- There you go with that "wishing" stuff.
I wish you was a wishing well... so that I could tie a bucket to you and sink you.
Maybe you found someone you like better.
How goes it, babe?
- Going south?
But I'm not accustomed to riding with strangers.
We're not going to be strangers.
- How far are you going?
- Pretty far. Near Jackson Park.
- Is that out of your way?
My chauffeur's just crazy about long drives.
Step on it, James.
Well, do I look good to you?
- You sure do.
- I feel flattered.
You know, you're not the worst I've seen, either.
- From Chicago?
I came from Texas.
- Where you living?
- The Congress Hotel.
If you're a stranger here, Tom and me will show you the town.
Stick to your driving, mug.
Say, you can let me off here.
I'm going to meet my friends on the corner.
Could I see you again later?
I'd be happy to have you call me sometime.
I mean, later today.
I'll think it over.
Give me your phone number and I'll call you.
All right, babe. Yards 3771.
And in the meantime, thanks.
- My name is Gwen.
Gwen Allen.
- And mine's Tom Powers.
- Yeah, and mine is Matt.
- He ain't got a name, just a number.
She's a honey.
I could go for her myself.
What do you mean, you could go for her yourself?
You could go for an 80-year-old chick with rheumatism.
When are you going to see her?
- She's going to call me.
- Find out if she's got a friend.
What do you want with her friend?
You got Mamie, ain't you?
Ain't you going to kiss your little baby?
- You got Kitty, ain't you?
- I ain't going to have her much longer.
I'm fed up.
You can tell her so for me.
Step on the gas, will you?
Max, George, quick.
Delighted to see you, Mr. Nathan.
- How are you, Joe?
- Fine, thank you.
Where would you like to sit?
Where do I always sit? Right at the ringside.
- May be full up there.
- We can fix that, sir.
Max, George, fix a table immediately at the railing for Mr. Nathan.
Great. The best is none too good tonight.
This is a wedding celebration.
Matt's decided to take something lawful: a wife.
- That's something to celebrate about.
- I should say so. - Meet Mr. and Mrs. Doyle.
- We're honored, I assure you.
- Let's dance while they're fixing the tables.
- This way, please.
- Hiya, Nails.
- Hello, Tom.
- How are you, Mr. Nathan?
- Harry, making money?
- Are you as happy as I am, Matt?
You fellows don't know what it means to a girl, getting married.
You knew all the time I was going to marry you, didn't you?
I was just thinking of Tom and Kitty.
Well, they're different.
I guess Tom ain't the marrying kind.
No, I guess not.
Are you sure that was old Putty Nose?
- I ought to know him when I see him.
- Sure you know him.
I suppose you'd like to put in with him again.
That's the Fagin that put something over on you, ain't it?
I had to laugh when I heard about that.
That guy's going to get you again.
He thinks you're soft.
- He ain't going to get me.
- We don't want any part of him.
I haven't got a thing to say, boys. But they got the Indian sign on you, Tom.
- He thinks you're a cinch.
- In a pig's eye.
That McGonagall ain't got a chance.
Take care of the women, Nails.
You're not going out in the cold, dark night, are you?
Nails will see that you get home.
We got a little job to do.
You're not gonna leave me tonight, Matt?
There's something we forgot to do, honey.
I'll be home later.
They're just walking around the block to cool themselves off.
What are you worrying about?
Have it ready at 8:00. Fill it with gas.
I'm going on a long trip.
Well, if it ain't Tom Powers and Matt, too.
How are you, boys?
- Been out of town?
- Yeah, I was down home, visiting.
- Got a little drink for us, Putty?
But I can't let you in just now.
You see, I've got a Jane inside.
I'll bring it right out to you.
Wait a minute, Putty Nose.
- We got words for you.
- What's up, Tom?
We got a little business to settle, Jane or no Jane.
You ain't sore, are you, Tom?
I've always been your friend.
Sure. You taught us how to cheat, steal, and kill.
Then you lammed out on us.
If it hadn't been for you, we might have been on the level.
Sure. We might have been ding-dings on a streetcar.
A Jane, huh?
There ain't no one here but him.
Why, you dirty, double-crossing...
What are you squawking about?
You got plenty more coming.
I don't want to die.
So you don't want to die?
Tommy, don't you remember you and Matt... how you used to be just kids and how we were friends?
You won't let him, Matt.
I'll do anything for you from now on.
Ain't you got a heart, Matty boy?
Don't you remember how I used to play to you? And didn't I always stick up for you?
I ain't got this coming.
Please, Matt, don't let him.
I ain't a bad fellow, really.
Tommy, don't.
Ain't you got a heart?
Tell me you won't let him, Matt, will you?
You remember that song I used to sing? That song I taught you?
You remember, Tommy.
Back in the club, how you kids used to laugh at that song.
Guess I'll call up Gwen.
She ought to be home by now.
Let me make you a cup of tea.
I got to be getting back on the job in a minute.
My, but it's good to see you again.
I was beginning to think I'd lost you.
You can't lose me that easy.
Poor Michael.
I'm afraid he's working himself into an early grave.
Days on the cars, school at night, and studying in between.
Listen, Ma, I came over to give you something.
Here, take this. When you need more, just say so. I'm making plenty.
You're a good boy, Tommy, but I can't.
- Mike wouldn't like it.
- Mike ain't got nothing to say about it.
I've got something important to say.
Keep it to yourself.
Nobody wants your two cents.
I don't want you two boys fighting. It ain't right for two brothers.
There won't be fighting. Only, I don't need his preaching.
- What is this, Ma?
- Tommy gave it to me to buy some things.
- Ain't that nice of him?
- It's more than you can do.
We don't want your money.
I'll look after Ma.
- On two bits a week? - Ma don't drink champagne.
I used to dance when I was a girl.
I won't argue with you, and I can't tell you all I'd like to in front of Ma.
But get an earful of this:
You ain't welcome in this house.
That's blood money. We want no part of it.
- Hiding behind Ma's skirts, like always.
- Better than hiding behind a machine gun.
You're too smart.
- I'm going, Ma.
- And don't forget your change.
- Money don't mean nothing to me.
- No, I guess not.
But with no heart or brains, it's all you've got.
Why you sneaking, stooling...
Michael, why did you hit him?
I may leave town next week.
You don't care, do you?
When I first met you, I sort of figured you was on the make. Not much.
You know what I mean.
And besides that... I figured you was sort of different, too.
That is, different from the kind of girls I was used to.
I don't go in for these long-winded things, but with me, it was always yes or no.
And I could never figure you out.
- Now can you?
But I guess I ain't your kind.
- Don't be like that, Tommy... because I "go for you," as you say.
Maybe too much.
You know, all my friends... think that things are different between us than they are.
They figure they know me pretty well... and don't think I'd go for a merry-go-round.
Do you think I'm giving you a merry-go-round?
- Then do you want things to be different... to please your boyfriends?
No, but how long can a guy hold out?
I'm gonna go screwy.
- I'm gonna blow.
You're a spoiled boy, Tommy.
You want things, and you're not content until you get them.
Or maybe I'm spoiled, too.
Maybe I feel that way, too.
But you're not running away from me.
Now you stay put, if you know what that means.
My bashful boy.
You are different, Tommy.
Very different.
And I've discovered it isn't only a difference in manner... and outward appearances.
It's a difference in basic character.
The men I know... and I've known dozens of them... they're so nice... so polished, so considerate.
Most women like that type.
I guess they're afraid of the other kind.
I thought I was, too.
But you're so strong.
You don't give, you take.
Tommy, I could love you to death.
Oh, nuts.
Is Tom here?
Nails is dead.
His horse.
He was thrown off in the park, kicked in the head.
- You got that horse that killed Nails?
- You mean Rajah?
He bad animal.
Yeah, what's he worth?
Spirited horse. I told Mr. Nathan not to ride him.
What's he worth?
He could be bought for $1,000. You see, it's...
- Never mind. Here.
- Where's he at?
Stall Number 3.
Stay where you are.
Right now, we ain't got a chance.
Since Nails has gone, his mob has scattered.
Look at this dump.
Four pineapples tossed at us in two days, and the brewery set fire.
I'm telling you, they got us on the run.
- Not me. I ain't running.
I ain't yellow. - Who said you was?
I ain't talking about that.
I'm gonna need you.
And you won't be no good to me when you're in the cemetery.
I got to have a couple of days to get the boys lined up again.
While I'm doing that... you'll be where nobody knows where to find you except me.
Come on, give me your guns and your money.
- What are you trying to pull, Paddy?
- I'm gonna keep you off the streets.
Even you wouldn't be sap enough to go for a stroll without your gat.
Come on, shower down.
All of it.
You got a phone here, Jane? I'm gonna call Gwen.
No, you keep away from that phone.
I'll call from outside and tell her I sent you out of town for a few days.
- And ring up Mamie, will you?
- Leave it to me.
This won't be for long, boys.
I'll have the mob lined up again in a couple of days.
You'll see that they're comfortable?
- You leave that to me, Paddy.
Gather round, boys. We're going to be a happy, little family.
I hope you got plenty of this medicine.
Yards 6321.
Is Schemer there?
Let me make you another drink, Tommy.
You mean to say you got any of that stuff left?
You haven't drank so much.
I can drink it as long as you can pour it.
Only a coal truck.
Had me going for a minute.
- Come on, get in the game, will you, Tom?
I'm gonna hit the hay.
I thought you'd like a little nightcap.
You don't need to feel ashamed in front of me.
- I don't need any help.
- Be a good boy and sit down.
I'll take your shoes off, too.
I want to do things for you, Tommy.
You don't think I'm old, do you?
- You like me, don't you?
What's the idea?
Just a goodnight kiss for a fine boy.
In your hat.
You're Paddy Ryan's girl.
- Breakfast is all ready, Tommy.
- I ain't hungry.
Give me some coffee, will you?
And make it black.
You aren't sorry, are you?
- Sorry for what?
- For last night.
What do you mean, for getting drunk?
Aren't you the little playactor?
Do you mean that...
Why, you...
- Tom, where you going?
- Home. - But Paddy...
- I don't care what Paddy said!
I'm getting out of this dump.
Hey, Tom, wait a minute.
- Nothing. I just got burned up, that's all.
What do you wanna run out on me for?
We're together, ain't we?
Sure.
Yes, sir?
I was looking at some of the pistols in the window.
- Shall I show you some?
- Yeah. - I kind of like that big one.
- That one?
All right.
- What do you call that?
- That's a.38 caliber.
It's a fine...
You got any more like it?
- I've got some smaller ones.
- No, same size. Sure.
- How do you load that?
- First you break it.
Then you stick the cartridges in the holes.
- Could I see?
- Like that?
- It'll hold six.
- This will be enough.
Stick them up.
Okay, Schemer, it's all set.
I ain't so tough.
- Well, Doc, what do you think?
- Can't say.
We'll hope for the best.
Doctor, this is Tom's mother, brother, and Miss Doyle.
You can go in for a few moments, Mrs. Powers.
Tommy boy.
Do you know me?
Sure, Ma.
- How are you, Tom, old scuff?
I've been wanting to see you.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me, Tom.
There's something I wanted to say to you, Mike.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
I'm just sorry. You know.
You and Mike are going to be friends again?
Friends.
Boys, I'm so happy.
So happy.
Ma, you must like Mike a lot better than me.
No, Tommy boy.
You're my baby.
I'm your baby.
You're coming home, ain't you, Tommy?
To stay?
Sure. Coming home.
I mean, if I can ever get out of here.
You're gonna get out of here, all right.
Why, of course you are.
You're going to get well and strong.
Both my boys back.
All of us together again.
I'm almost glad this happened.
And he really looked better today, did he, Michael?
Sure, Ma, a lot better. He was sitting up.
I told him you'd be in to see him tomorrow.
- And he'll be coming home soon, won't he?
- Sure, Ma.
Paddy, come in.
Is Tom...
They kidnapped him from the hospital this afternoon.
Must have been the Burns mob.
First they give it to him in the back, then they take him when he's helpless.
Who knows what they're doing to him now.
- They ain't gonna get away with this.
My boys are out in the street now.
I'll bring Tom back, if it's the last thing I do.
- You're gonna... stay here at that phone and take messages.
I told my boys to call you up if they find anything.
- I'd like to smash...
- Listen...
I sent word to Burns that if he'd bring Tom back here tonight... I'd quit the racket.
He could have it all.
I'd leave town and I won't come back.
- You think they'll do it?
- It's a sweet offer.
If you hear anything from any one of my boys... call me at my place.
I got to get back on the job.
Don't you like your dinner?
Why, I just ain't hungry, Ma.
I'll get it, Ma.
Ma, they're bringing Tom home.
- They are? When?
- Right now. He's on his way.
- He must be. - They wouldn't be bringing him home.
I'll get his room ready.
I knew my baby would come home.
- Who called?
- One of Paddy's boys. Didn't say who.
- Molly dear?
- Yes, Mother?
Bring up some clean sheets out of the linen closet.
- Hurry, dear.

FLOOR GIVEN TO
THE POPULAR ARTIST OF THE REPUBLIC KACHALOV
Whose are these scrawny bodies in lousy rags?
From whence do these dirty, savage looks come?
What future awaits them?
What will become of them?
Street boy today, enemy of labor and bandit tomorrow!
During the world bloodshed their fathers perished in the Tsarist jaws, invaders tortured their mothers with a siege of hunger.
Early childhood left their faces marked with the lines of anxiety.
They roamed through the cities like a pack of nasty, starving wolves.
What will save them?
Charity?
Moral education?
They laugh at those things, just as we do!
But we know something better:
environment creates the man.
Having measured the power of free universal labour, the Republic of Soviets will give them a start in life.
We are erecting Giants of Industry in the unpopulated taiga.
We have found the lever which sets the destiny of mankind in motion.
We'll teach these street boys to make their way in the new world.
We'll re-mould them into workers of the world edification. BE SURE

Quick, quick!
From joints, underground nests, caves and tumbledown houses there were gathered that night more than a thousand homeless children, crippled by the street.
In the Soviet Republic there shouldn't be poverty-stricken and homeless children. May there be instead strong and happy young citizens.
A SPECIAL COMMISSION PERFORMED THE VAST AND COMPLEX TASK
OF SELECTING AND DISTRIBUTING THE STREET CHILDREN.
What is your occupation?
I'm a streetwalker.

Did you escape from Rostov's institution?
I escaped.
From Saratov?
Have you been in Serpuhov's prison in Moscow?
I escaped!
Where should we send you now?
I'll only escape!
To the reformatory then. Lock him up!
Savatat kurjat
I'll escape! I swear it!
Let's go to that room.
- I won't go! I won't!
- Let's go.
Come on, come on!
Here he is, Mustafa Dude!
What do you want, comrade?
Nikolay Rebrov
Is he here with you, comrades?
He doesn't appear on checklists.
Check the rooms.
Come with me, comrade!
A cop's coming.
Let's ask for shag.
This guy took 130 and is afraid to play!
I'm a boy far from home, forgotten by people.
Forgotten, abandoned, long long ago I've been an orphan, with no smile.
I've been an orphan, with no smile.
So I'll die, I'll die They'll bury me and nobody'll know grave of me and nobody'll know the grave of me
And on my stone no music plays just early spring KOLKA DISAPPEARED... and nightingales just early spring and nightingales
Comrades, do you think...
Comrades! Attention please!
do you think that such difficult boys ought to be isolated?
I flatly refuse.
In my opinion...
I say and I must insist: kids like Mustafa must be sent to a reformatory.
Locking them up is no solution.
Comrades, we must think about what to do with these kids. They run wild and escape from anywhere, the devil only knows how!
Prison! ?
Another solution must be found!
We have to think about it!
In my opinion there's nothing to think about.
THE COMMISSION THEN commission then DECIDED TO CARRY OUT AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPERIMENT Ah! Comrade cop!
Hello, hello!
Are you off your rocker?
Saying hello to an empty room!
Hey you, sissy!
Why did they bring us here?
For examination or what?
Hey boys, look.
Comrade officer, you may go.
- You're what!
Hey guys, he's a doctor!
Here it is, undress!
And pants, do we take them off?
You're a doctor, aren't you?
Okay, that's enough!
Come on boys, get dressed!
Get dressed, cheer up!
- Here it is now, get dressed!
- Come here!
- First undress, now get dressed! - Come here.
Come on, cheer up, get dressed.
Undress then get dressed!
Look here, boys!
You're just sitting here, spoiling the air!
You don't want to go to an orphanage, do you?
Right, right!
You're good guys!
What's there for you in an orphanage?
And sitting here is such a bore.
A real bore!
And, oh boys, it's so good to be free right now!
So!
Here's the deal!
A secret one!
I'm setting up a factory - a commune in an ex-monastery.
Who wants to come?
As volunteers.
We'll all work together.
Woodworker, locksmith, shoemaker, mechanic, as you wish!
And you'll run the commune yourselves.
Complete trust!
And you'll be free.
Who wants to? Speak up!
We know your communes!
You'll pen us in a fucking dump!
You'll put cops everywhere.
What will you feed us?
Thin broth?
We'll be in prison getting on the cops' nerves!
THE COMMUNE'S ORGANIZER SERGEEV:
Chew it over.
As you wish.
You can leave when you want.
We'll go to your commune.
You persuaded us, doctor!
Effendi, good-bye!
THE BOYS AGREED TO GO TO THE COMMUNE, ONLY SO THEY MIGHT ESCAPE ON THE WAY.
WILL THERE BE MANY GUARDS?
- Hello, comrade Sergeev.
- Your pass.
WILL THE ESCAPE SUCCEED?
Well, boys, come on!
What's the problem, boys?
Where is the guard?
There won't be any.
You're on your honour.
WILL THEY RUN AWAY? OR NOT?
RUN AWAY OR NOT?
RUN AWAY? OR NOT?
AT THE STATION SOMETHING BAFFLING HAPPENS... MUSTAFA THE THIEF
IN ORDER TO BUY FOOD FOR THE ROAD.
RUN AWAY? OR NOT?
GONE...
Mustafa's here!
Skilful fingers don't cheat.
- Well done, Mustafa!
Well, Mustafa-
May it be the last time!
FIFTY KILOMETERS FROM THE RAILWAY...
THE COMMUNE FACTORY
Think of this as a loan from the governement.
You'll work it off.
A telegram from Sergeev's commune.
Mishka, more hot water NOT ONE OF THE ELEVEN RAN AWAY
Vaska, rub my back EXPERIMENT SUCCESSFUL -SERGEEV
Boys, I will now cut out the last for boots.
This way!
Here's the last!
Well who wants to cut one?
Come on! Have a try, we'll see!
Mustafa, keep your end up! AND SO BEGAN THE TRANSFORMATION OF PICKPOCKETS, PURSE-SNATCHERS,
INTO LOCKSMITHS, TURNERS, FOUNDERS AND CASTERS.
BUT THIEVES' SKILLS USEFUL TO THIS WORK WERE NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN.
Mishka!
Someone swiped the spoons!
Really? !
- Sit down, quick.
- Faster, find a seat!
- Ginger, here!
- Everyone has to gobble up!
- Give us some spoons!
- Where are the spoons? !
- Hey intendent, give us spoons!
Give me a spoon, give me a blade, So good is my babe!
Somebody swiped all the knives, forks and spoons.
If we don't find them, their cost will be deducted from your pay.
A spoon!
It's hot!
Who stole the spoons? !
Give yourself up, Mishka!
I won't be no pig!
It's Grishka Cross-eyed who swiped them.
I know that son of a bitch!
Snuffy's eating and you're blowing!
See what good fellows live among us? !
I want spoons with my dinner! We won't cover up for anybody.
We'll find them!
AND IN THE EVENING...
How much is this toy?
Fish, golden fish!

Madame, step aside!
Do you have some cutlets?
Give me that green rubber band.
- Pirozhki, who wants pirozhki!
- Come on, roll up!
- Roasted!
Stop him!
He stole some boots!
Beat him! Beat him up!
Catch him!
- Behind the tent.
They're running!
Beat him up!
- Bandits!
- They all should be killed!
- Why are they beating him?
- He stole some boots!
You shouldn't beat a person.
There are judges!
To judge what!
Just hit him on the head with the weight!
Kill him! Why are they beating him?
Maybe he didn't steal them for himself. Maybe he walks barefoot.
- We mustn't pity them, but kill them!
He's not guilty!
Come with me, mister, to the police. You're charged with bodily harm.
Speaking!
- Step up here, comrade!
- Go, he must be arrested!
Comrade chief, I held this citizen for grievous bodily harm.
I don't appear to have them with me.
Only this document.
FRIEND OF CHILDREN.
TRADING LICENCE ISSUED BY M. Somnin
Hey you, friend!
What a bastard you are!
Fathers and mothers!
And if your son, your dear one were hit? If his face were smashed against the pavement?
Would you shoot?
Would you kill?
CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT
We want to go to the commune.
We want to make boots with our own hands.
- Move away!
- Why are you gathered here?
Disperse!
- What's your problem!
- Stop messing about.
Get lost!
They want to go to the commune!
They want to make boots with their hands.
Ah, those bastards!
Good boys!
The fuzz got scared!
They flocked like an army.
Brave boys!
Kolka brought us here.
He led us here to go to the commune!
Winter passed.
The commune grew and developed.
The workshops were processing on a large and important order.
The awl, the chisel and the saw were giving people a rebirth.
It looked as if labour had won for good... but... the spring brought unexpected results.
The elements' fury affected the commune.
The delivery of raw materials stopped; production ceased.
Unwelcome inactivity followed.
Rows began.
- It's like we're under arrest.
- Not even a town nearby.
- Let's leave this place!
- We wish we could work!
- Just hanging around.
- We want to work!
We can't play cards or drink vodka.
No vodka!
The machines are at a standstill!
To hell with the commune!
Silence, d'you hear!
Comrade Sergeev!
We can't stay without work.
The boys are getting edgy!
Nikolay Ivanovich!
Make a decision!
Alright, boys!
I'll go to Moscow.
I'll discuss it.
Let's play!
- I'll show you how to cheat.
- You'd better look out!
- Take that!
FOR FIVE DAYS THE BOYS HAD BEEN MAKING TROUBLE.
Why hasn't Nikolay Ivanovich come back yet?
What are we gonna do?
- Ginger!
Why did you kill Snuffy?
- It's our mutt.
What do you care, you, midget? !
They've driven us miles from anywhere but we'll leave anyway!
We're lying idle; becoming sissies.
Destroy the workshops.
Smash everything!
Smash everything to fucking pieces!
Come on!
Destroy the workshops!
Everything!
You'd destroy your living! ?
Live here yourself, you bugger! Hooligans!
Can't you see they're destroying the workshops!
- Beat him!
- Kick him in the teeth!
Let me!
Let me, I tell you!
And you came on your own to make shoes in the commune.
Hey you! Swine!
What's been going on? Boys!
He killed Snuffy!
Well, you sure made great use of your time!
And I brought you a little present!
We'll be building a railway from the commune to the station.
And you'll be fully responsible for its upkeep, boys.
- Yes, we do.
- Shall we go?
- Mustafa... will be an engine driver!
- Engine driver!
And Kolka will be a fare collector!
Fare collector.
I'll be a switchman!
Whoever doesn't want to work, whoever wants to make trouble,
then let him leave now!
Well boys, I hope I've said it once and for all!
Boys!
Toss Nikolay Ivanovich!
- Toss Sergeev!
Here lie the tracks.
The machines won't stand still anymore.
You, poor head of mine
Will still I bear you for long?
You, my fatal destiny
Will I still...
live for long?
THE UNDERWORLD STARTED TO BECOME CONCERNED.
Why did I come into existence?
What did my mother beget me for?
THE BEST BOYS HAVE GONE AWAY In order to experience prison.
Mustafa's gone!

THAT IS HOW, IN AN ABANDONED FOREST WORKMAN'S HUT, THE BIG BUSINESS BEGAN.
My respect!
Get out of my way!
That was some walk they took!
To Nikolay Ivanovich,
my respect!
Fifteen days!
Fifteen days of drunkenness and shirking at work.
You drunken mugs, where did you get pissed?
Oh why, by what coincidence, to me you're the only one to please and all the others I just tease?
They ripped my new dress up, And poked my right eye out
It was the first time, so no! don't scold me, mum, don't shout!
Oh my! The woods are deep And daddy is single though
But when he marries then, Where shall mummy go?
O Oh why, by what coincidence, to me you're the only one to please?

Oh by what... coincidence to me you're the only one to please
Pour some vodka!
Come on, come on, come on!
What's your name, eh?
Hands up, you rascals!
You brought girls to muddle the boys up!
Well, Mustafa!
You became a cop!
Hold the drunken bastards!

I'm alive, daddy.
I'll be the first engine driver on the first steam engine.
And I'll be a fare collector.
And Mustafa will be the first engine driver on the first steam engine
And I will be a fare collector.
The commune workers welcome the first steam engine!
AND ONLY BY NIGHT, WHEN THE PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE NEXT DAY'S CELEBRATION
I'll be the first one to return on the first steam engine!
Good-bye, Mustafa!
Song in Mari language
You damaged the rail!
At the opening of the railway
Hello boys!
Hello comrade Skryabina!
- They came to see us!
How's life?
THE WORKER'S DELEGATION IS HERE
- It has never been so good!
- Hello comrade Martinov!
- Hello boys!
- Here's our steam engine! - It'll take us to the commune.
Nikolka!
When are we leaving?
When Mustafa comes from the commune.
Something's delayed him.
We'll wait a little.
AT THE COMMUNE...
Mishka!
- Vanka!
- Oy!
AT THE STATION...
The opening of the railway turned into festivities.
The commune workers and all the people around prepared to welcome the first steam engine.
Fomka Shark's knife.
Why aren't they coming?
THE FIRST ONE
ON THE FIRST STEAM ENGINE,
AND HIS BEST FRIEND
KOLKA WHISTLE.
They're coming!
Mustafa wanted to be the first engine driver!
To those of you who survived the famine, to those of you who got a fresh start in life,
to those of you who campaign for an end to homelessness, and to you, the first president of the Children's department, the best friend of children,
to you, Felix Dzerzhinsky this film is dedicated.
I say, i see they're cutting down the trees in longmeadow.
Are they?
I say, jill, i hardly ever see you now. 'tis rotten.
Why are they cutting down those trees?
Why... wants to build more cottages.
Wants every cottage he can get for his workmen.
Always work. They simply spoil the place.
You going to take the same attitude as your people?
What attitude?
Oh, this high and mighty we've-owned-the-land- forever business.
It is rather snobbish, you know.
Do you know your mother hasn't even called our clan?
Mmm, i know. I'm awfully sorry.
I know she ought to call.
My brother charlie and she don't like it, nor does my father, i can tell you.
Mr. Hornblower never to have found that land without those works.
Oh, that's rather dog in the manger.
I like you, but i don't like him, and i don't like his works.
You might realize that we've been here since elizabeth and rather naturally love the place.
And can't bear to see it being spoiled.
Well, you call it spoiling; we call it progress.
My father's a very clever man, you know. He's just as human as yours.
Since mother died, he's been absolutely wrapped up in us.
All this getting on is for us.
He thinks he's entitled to a little influence here, and you and the girls try to stop him.
You ought to be just, jill.
I am just, and i want awfully to be on good terms.
And... he's so pushy.
You won't let it come between us, will you?
I don't know.
Oh, well, i must be getting along.
See you soon, i hope.
I'm sorry, but i want the cottages. You'll have to clear out.
Mr. Hornblower, i'm sure mr.
Hillcrist would never have turned us out. Oh, mr. Hillcrist be damned.
Sir, mr. Hillcrist told us when he sold the land to you that it was on condition that we and the others shouldn't be turned out.
Yes, well, i didn't think i'd need the cottages then, but now, i must have them for my workmen.
I've got important works, you know.
Well, look here now.
I don't want to be hard on you i'll give you ³³5 to cover the whole thing.
We wouldn't take ³³50.
Why, we've brought up 3 children here, and i've buried 2. We're very attached to it, you see, sir.
Yes, I... well, look here, now.
I'll give you ³³10, eh?
Here, i'll send a wagon to ship your things.
Here, here, if that isn't fair, hmm?
Well, you better accept.
I shan't keep it open.
Won't take it.
Not a farthing. Why, we come here when we was married.
Well, i was going to give you another week, but now you'll go out next saturday.
Now, take care you're not late, or your things will be pulled out in the rain.
You're no gentleman.
Don't put temptation in my way, that's all.
Yes, and you can tell your fine friend hillcrist what's happening anyway, i'll soon let him know.
Here's your hat.
We'll go right on up and see the squire now.
When i sold longmeadow and the cottages to hornblower, it was on the distinct understanding that there was to be no disturbance of tenancy.
He's no gentleman, sir. He put it so brisk. We've been there 30 years.
So now we don't know what to do.
I hope you'll excuse us coming round, sir.
I should think so, indeed.
I certainly would never have sold if i had known he was going to do this.
They talk about his having bought the centry, sir, to put up more chimneys there.
That's why he want s the cottages.
Centry?
Yes, sir. It's such a pretty spot.
It looks beautiful from here.
Loveliest spot in all deepwater, i always say.
And your father owned it and his father before him. I hope you're going to stop it, sir.
It does put us about.
Hillcrist will stand up for us, i know.
You leave it to me, mrs.
Good morning, then good morning, sir.
Good morning, and thank you kindly.
Is mrs. Hillcrist about, fellowes?
She was in the garden with mr.
Dawker, sir, but i think she's come in since and gone in to the study.
Oh... look, look, what a nice coat he has.
Are you very busy for a moment?
Is it anything important?
All right, we'll leave the question of showing for a moment.
I'll see you later don't go, dawker.
The jackmans have been turned out of their cottage by hornblower.
Oh! You remember when i sold, i stipulated they were not to be.
They've been there 30 years.
I won't have it! It's a breach of faith.
Do you suppose this hornblower would care 2 straws about that, jack?
He must! When it's put to him if he's any decent feeling.
The jackmans talk about his having bought the centry to put up more chimneys.
It could ruin the place utterly, besides cutting us off from the dukes.
Miss mullins would never sell behind our backs.
Well, i must see that he... i must stop his turning these people out.
What do you think about it, dawker?
Smart man, hornblower.
Never lets the grass grow.
Smart! Don't underrate his ego, sir.
Cad, i called him.
That's right, ma'' with all the advantages.
But miss mullins would never sell the centry, would she, dawker?
I heard she wants to, and hornblower won't stick at the price, sir.
What's it worth, dawker?
All depends what you want it for, ma'am he wants it for spite.
We want it for sentiment.
It's worth what you'd like to get for it, and he's a rich man.
You give me your figure, sir. I'll try the old lady before he gets her.
Better let dawker make sure, jack.
Jackman tells me this hornblower is coming to see me.
I'll put it to him.
Make him all the keener, sir.
Better get in first.
Ape his methods?
Go and see miss mullins now.
We leave it to you to do the best you can.
Mr. Hornblower, sir.
A fine morning.
Lovely weather.
Haven't seen you for a long time, hillcrist.
Not since i sold you longmeadow and the cottages, i believe.
That's just what i've come about.
Forgive me, won't you sit down?
What have you got, gout?
Oh, that's unfortunate i never get it.
I have no disposition that way.
Had no ancestors, you see.
Just me own drinking to answer for.
I wonder if mrs. Hillcrist thinks that.
Am i lucky to have no past, ma'am, just the future?
You're quite sure you have the future, mr. Hornblower?
Oh, yes, i've got the future, all right.
I've had the jackmans here, mr. Hornblower.
Oh, man with the little spitfire wife?
They're very excellent, good people, and they've lived quietly in that cottage for 30 years.
Now you wanted me to stir you up a bit.
You know, deepwater needs a bit of gold put into it.
There's generally some gold where i am.
I daresay you wish there's been no...
We certainly like people to keep their word, mr. Hornblower.
Amy.
Never mind, hillcrist. Takes more than that to upset me.
You promised me, you know, not to disturb the tenancies.
Yes, well, i've come to tell you that i've got to.
I wasn't expecting to have the need when i bought.
I thought the duke would sell me a bit down there, but devil if he will.
And now i must have those cottages for my workmen.
I've got important works, you know.
The jackmans have their importance, too, sir. Their heart's in that cottage.
Well, if you think so much of these jackmans, why not build them a cottage yourselves?
You've got the space.
You promised me, and i sold on that understanding.
I bought on the understanding i'd get some more land from the dukes.
That's nothing to do with me.
Ah, you'll find that it has, 'cause i'm going to have those cottages.
Well, i call it simply... now, now, look here, hillcrist.
You've not had occasion to understand men like me.
, i've got the guts, and i've got the money and i don't sit still on it.
I'm going ahead becaus e i believe in meself.
I've no use for sentiment, that sort of thing.
Why, 40 of your jackmans aren't worth me little finger.
Of all the blatant things i ever heard said... well, as we are speaking plainly...
I've been thinking you want the village run your old-fashioned way, and i want it run mine.
I'll fancy there's not room for the two of us here.
When are you going?
Oh, never fear.
I'm not going.
Oh ho! Is it true about the centry?
Gospel true.
Well, if you want to know, my son charlie is buying it this very minute.
Ah, he's with the old lady. She wants to sell.
And she'll get her price, whatever it is.
If this isn't a skin game, mr. Hornblower, i don't know what is.
Huh! You've got a very nice expression there.
Skin game.
Well, bad words break no bones, and they're wonderful for hardening the heart.
If it wasn't for a lady's presence, i could give you a specimen or two.
That needn't stop you, i'm sure, mr.
Hornblower.
Oh, and i don't kn ow that it need. You're an obstruction, the likes of you. You're in my path.
It'll do you a power of good to know that you're not almighty.
This is being neighborly?
And how have you tried being neighborly to me?
If i haven't a wife, i've got a daughter-in-law have you called on her, ma'am?
No. No, i'm new, and you're an old family.
You don't like me. You think i'm a pushy man.
I go to chapel, and you don't like that.
I make things and i sell them. You don't like that.
I buy land, and you don't like that. It threatens the view from your windows.
Well, i don't like you, and i don't want to put up with your attitude.
You've had things your own way too long, and now you're not gonna have them any longer.
Oh ho ho! Now, look here, hillcrist. I don't object to you personally.
You seem to me a poor sort of creature that's bound to get left with your gout and your dignity.
But of course, you can make yourself pretty disagreeable before you're done.
Now i want to be the moving spirit here.
I'm full of plans.
I'm gonna stand for parliament.
I'm gonna make this a prosperous place.
I'm a good-natured man if you'll treat me as such.
Now, you take me on as a neighbor... and all that, and i'll manage withou t chimneys in the centry.
Not if you'd bought the centry 10 times over.
Your ways are not mine.
I'll have nothing to do with you.
Really? Is that so?
Now you are going to learn some things, and it's time you did.
Do you realize that i'm very nearly around you?
I'm at... up hill. The works are here.
Here's longmeadow.
Here's the centry, that i've just bought.
So my goods will be running right round you.
How will you like that for a country place?
Eh? That's not a bit sporting of you, mr. Hornblower.
Well... you should hear both sides before you say that, missy.
There isn't anothe r side to turning out the jackmans after you promised... oh, dear me, yes.
Why, they don't matter a row of gingerbread compared to the schemes i've got for bettering this neighborhood.
I had been standing up for you. Now i won't.
Oh, dear, dear. What'll become of me, eh?
I won't say anything about the other thing, because i think it's beneath dignity to notice it, but to turn poor people out of their cottage is a shame.
Well, what's the good?
Life's too short for rows.
I'll answer to god for my actions, not to you, young lady.
You blasphemous young thing.
Jill, i wish you'd kindly not talk.
I don't think i want to say anything more to you, hornblower. Good morning.
All right. We'll play what you call a skin game, hillcrist, without gloves on.
We won't spare each other.
You look out for yourselves.
By god, after this morning, i mean business.
Where's my hat?
Say that i'm here, will you?
Well... dawker?
Safe, for the moment.
The old lady will put it up to auction.
Couldn't get her to budge from that.
Said she didn't want to be unneighborly.
Ask me, it's money she smells.
Can i see you alone for a moment, please, ma'am?
It's rather important. In the study, dawker.
I bet dawker's up to no good.
I can tell by his expression.
I don't like dawker, father.
He's so common.
My dear, we can't all be uncommon.
And he's got lots of dough.
I bet they've got some scheme on that'll make you do things you don' t approve of if you don't look out.
Mother's fearfully bitter when she gets her knife in.
If old hornblower' s disgusting, there's no reason why we should be.
So you think i'm capable? That's nice, jill.
No, no, darling.
But i want to warn you solemnly ir that mother would tell you you're fighting fa no matter what she and dawker do.
Jill, i never saw you so serious.
Sorry. I was just beginning to enjoy myself, now everything's going to be bitter and beastly with mother in that mood.
That horrible old man.
Oh, daddy, i... don't let them make you horrid. You're such a darling.
How's your gout, ducky?
Better, a lot better.
There, you see? That shows. It's going to be half interesting for you, not for us.
Look here, jill, is there anything between you and this young what's-his-name rolf?
No, but... now it's all spoiled.
You don't expect me to regret that.
I don't mean any tosh about love's young dream, but i do like being friends.
I want to enjoy things, and you can't do that when everybody's on the hate.
You're going to wallow in it.
So shall i.
Oh, i know i shall.
We shall all wallow and think of nothing but one for his nob.
Aren't you fond of your home?
Of course. I love it.
Well, you won't be abl e to live here unless we stop that ruffian.
Imagine it. Chimneys and smoke, all the trees cut down, piles of pots all over the place.
You know, i was born here and my father and his and his.
They loved those fields and the old trees.
Do you know i learned to ride in the centry meadows?
Prettiest spring meadows in the world.
You may go through life and never find anything so good and beautiful as this old home, and i'm not going to have it spoiled without a fight.
I say, do you see old hornblower and his son charlie?
Oh, look. There's chloe.
You know, charlie's wife standing with rolf.
I say, rolf, just leave me alone for a moment, would you?
What did that woman mean by insulting you like that?
I'll make them pay for it.
Wonderful improvement we're having in the town, ma'am.
I did hear we're having the electric lights soon.
Mrs. Hillcrist, I... well?
I haven't done you any harm.
Did i ever say you had?
No, but you act as though i had.
I'm not aware that i acted at all... as yet.
You're nothing to me except as one of your family.
It isn't as if i want to spoil your home.
Stop them, then.
I see your husband out there with his father.
I'll try.
I suppose such men pay no attention to what women are.
I'm fond of my husband i don't quite know why you spoke to me.
I only thought you might like to treat me as a human being.
Really, i... i'd rather you left me alone just now, if you don't mind.
I'll move further up.
Get up, dawker.
In case i don't see the squire, would you ask him when i come to his limit, blow his nose if he wants me to go on.
And when he blows the second time,
I'll stop for good what limit did you settle?
£³6,000.
That's a fearful price.
From the ground... from the ground, you see that chap i told you about come down from town.
He's a fellow who can tell us all about young mrs.
H. Watch me cross over, you'll see me stand beside him.
Jack, i've just seen dawker. He says if you want to go about 6,000, blow your nose once.
When you blow it the second time, he'll take it as a signal to stop bidding altogether.
Jack, go and offer her my smelling salts.
Thank god for human touch.
I say, have a sniff.
You look awfully white.
No, i'm all right. Thank you.
No, no, do. You must.
Now, you know, i've only one property to sell. That very desirable corn and stock-rearing and parklike residential land known as the, uh, centry, deepwater.
Unique property.
An a-1 chance to an a-1 audience.
Mister... you won't mind listening to the conditions. Mr. Brinker will read them, and they won't worry you, i'm sure.
Now, gentlemen, it's not often a piece of land like this comes into the market. No better land in deepwater.
No better land in deepwater.
That's right, mr. Spicer.
I know the village well, and a charming place it is.
Perfect locality, to be sure.
Well, i'm not gonna waste your time by singing the praises of this property.
There it is, well-watered, nicely timbered, no reservation of timber.
Gentlemen, no tenancy to hold you up, free to do what you like with it tomorrow.
And you've got a jewel of a site there, too. Perfect position for a house. Lies between the dukes and squire hillcrist's.
An emerald isle.
No allusion to our ireland gentlemen. Perfect peace in the centry.
Nothing like it in the county.
Carries the mineral rights, and as you know, perhaps, there's a very valuabl e deepwater clay there.
What shall i start it at?
3,000?
A gentleman site, a gentlemen site. You don't have that given you every day.
3,000. well, i'm not particular.
Anything you'd like to give me come on, you've got more time than me, i expect.
200 acres of first rate grazing and corn land.
And a site for a residence unequaled in the county.
Now, then. Now, then.
What shall i say? Think of all the possibilities.
What shall i say?
2,000. that won't hurt you, mr.
Why, it's worth that to overlook the duke.
For 2,000. for 2,000.
2,000...
2,500, thank you, sir.
Mr. Sammy, don't scratch your head over it.
3,000.
3,000 for this desirable property.
Why, you'd think it wasn't desirable.
3,000... come on, a little spirit, gentlemen.
For 3,500.
May i say 4? Take hundred?
I'm not particular. I'll take hundreds. 3,600.
Uh, 700.
Come on, gentlemen, i don't want to wait all day.
I don't want to wait all day.
4, may i say?
4,000. that's better.
Now we're beginning.
And one, and two.
And 3.
May I... and 4 and 5, and 6.
And 7. 8. 9, may i say?
5,000. 5,000.
5,000... yes. 5,000.
There's more spirit in that, gentlemen.
More spirit. 5,000.
Dada, why can' t i see the bids?
That last was hornblower.
Now, gentlemen, i'm not going to give this property away.
5,000 bid.
Who was that, dada? Hornblower.
It's the duke agent in the center.
Yes, but... shh.
Now, this chance may never come again.
As the poet says, how we regret it if we don't get it.
Now, may i say 5,600?
7 and 8. 5,800 bid.
Well, we're getting on.
But we haven't reached the value yet.
5,800 bid.
Come along. We're not beaten.
5,900. and 6,000.
6,000 bid. 6,000.
For 6,000. the centry.
Finest spot in the county.
6,000. going for the low price of 6,000.
Come gentlemen, we haven't dried up. A little spirit.
6,000. for 6,000.
For ³³6,000.
I'm selling. We've got it!
6,000 once. 6,000 twice. And one, sir?
6,100 bid.
Blow your nose, jack.
If it goes over 7,000, i don't know if we can't stand it.
And two, thank you.
For 6,000... and 3.
And 4? For ³³6,400?
This coveted property.
For ³³6,400.
Why, it's giving it away, gentlemen. 6,400 bid.
And 5.
And 6. and 7. and 8.
For 6,800. for 6,800.
Once, twice.
For the last time, this dominating site.
For 6,900.
Don't blow your nose again, jack.
That's the signal for dawker to give in. Don't do it yet.
7,000. may i say?
7,000. going for 7,000 once, twice... and one.
Gentlemen, i have a bid for $7,100 for the centry.
I'm instructed to take it if i can't get more.
It's a fair price. It's not a big price. Sunken price.
Sunken price?
Well, you ought to know about sunken, i admit.
Now, i suppose someone will offer $7,200.
No one? Well, i can't make you, gentlemen.
Well, to mr.
Hornblower, for 7,100.
Once, twice...
7,200.
May i have yours, sir? And 3.
And 4. 7,400.
And 5 and 6. 7,600.
8,000 may i say?
8,000. and one and two and 3 and 4 and 5.
8,500? 600? 700?
May i have yours sir? 8! 9,000.
9,000.
9,000. for 9,000.
Once, twice... for the third and last time... 9,500!
And 500.
For 9,500.
May i have yours, sir?
Was that the duke's agent who made that last bid?
Thank god that stopped hornblower, anyway.
The centry, deepwater, for 9,500.
Once, twice... for the last time at 9,500.
No more today, gentlemen.
I say, do you see chloe sitting down? She looks awfully queer. I think it's something to do with that man who was with dawker.
Well, we'd better get on.
There's someone to look after her.
I say, charles hornblower doesn't seem very upset.
You ran me up a pretty price.
That's a bit very good, hillcrist.
But you didn't quite get my million.
It's just my 9,000 that you kept.
Thank god the centry's gone to a gentleman. Ha!
The duke!
The centry's not gone to a gentleman, nor to a fool.
It's gone to me. What?
I'm sorry for you. You're not fit to manage these things.
Well, it's a monstrous price, and i've had to pay it because of your obstinacy.
I shan't forget that when i come to bill.
You mean to say that last bid was for you?
Well, of course i do.
I told you i was a bad man to be up against.
Perhaps you believe me now. A trick!
Trick?
You had an agent bid for you.
I had an agent bid for me.
Only your agent bid at the beginning, and mine bid at the end.
What's the trick in that, eh?
What did you call it? A skin game?
Remember, we're playing a skin game.
If we were younger men... aw, it wouldn't look pretty for us to be at fisticuffs.
We'll leave the fighting for the young ones.
And as for you, missy, you leave my boy alone.
Dada... may i spit it his eye or something?
You won this round, sir, by a foul blow.
We'll see who can take advantage of it. I believe the law can stop your ruining my property.
Mr. Hornblower?
Will you fight foul, so shall we.
We will not be foul played towards you and yours.
You're outside the pale.
You fair got my dander up.
It's no use to bandy words.
Mr. Hornblower, if you build... you know, it's laughable.
You make me pay $9,500 for a bit of land not worth 4, and you think i'm not going to get back on me?
Why, i'm going on with as little consideration as if you were a family of black beetles.
Good afternoon.
There's something on?
That man and dawker know something about chloe, i'm sure of it.
And mother's in the secret, too.
What did you ask dawker, dada?
What's this mystery about young mrs. Hornblower? No mystery, sir.
Better not ask in front of jill. Oh, nonsense.
It's not for a girl to hear.
What load of rot! I read the papers every day.
No worse to see in there anyway.
Do you want your daughter... you think i was mother at my age.
I was not so proud of my knowledge. No, but you had it.
Now, what is it?
What is it? Come here a minute, dawker.
Well, whatever it is about chloe, i'm sorry for her.
How do you know this?
My friend over there is one of the agents, sir.
Shocking. I'm sorr y i heard it.
I told you not to.
Tell your friend to come here.
Are you sure of what you said?
I remember her quite well.
Her name then was... i don't want to know, thank you.
It's not to be spoken of.
It will not be spoken of that mr. Hornblower is wise.
He is not wise? It must be spoken of.
I say no, amy.
I won't have it.
To use a piece of knowledge about a woman? It's repugnant.
I won't do it.
If you had a son tricked into marrying such a woman, would you wish to remain ignorant of it?
I don't know. I don't know.
You realize... that an implication of this kind may be grounds for a criminal libel action. Quite.
There's not a shadow of doubt.
Not the faintest.
You saw her just now. Yes.
I did.
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.
Hornblower is looking for you, madam.
Shall i tell... i'll tell mr. Hornblow er you're down.
How's the head oh, beastly, thanks.
I say, let's go in the study for a minute.
I've got dawker waitin g by the garage now.
He says he can only stay a few minutes.
I say, are you sure it's all right?
You don't want this quarrel with hillcrist to go on, do you, rolf? No, i hate it.
Well, i think perhaps i can stop it. That's why...
What you doing in here, eh?
How're you feeling , chloe? Oh, awful head.
Have you?
Hey, i'm sorry.
Can you tend a moment?
I've had a note from that woman.
Well, what's the meaning of it, eh?
Is it sheer impudence or lunacy or what?
If there's anythin you better tell me.
Forewarned is forearmed, you know.
Unless it's that my father was a bankrupt. Ha!
Well, many a man has been that.
You've never told us much about your family.
It's just... i wasn't very proud of them. Hmm?
What were you going to say, rolf?
Oh, nothing.
Well, you're n ot responsible for your father, hmm?
No, if that's the one, it's a relief oh, the bitter snobs.
I'll remember it in the account i've got with them don't say anything to charlie.
Do not worry him for nothing.
Oh, no, no, no. I'll not. Ha!
Why, if i went bankrupt, it'd upset charlie , i'd never doubt.
Now, there's nothi ng else before i answer her, hmm?
She might invent things, of course.
Ah, but there's a such thing as the laws of slander.
If they play pranks, i'll have them up for it. There's dinner.
Come on.
No, i don't think i'll go in to dinner.
My head's terrible.
Aw. I'll just go into the garden for a bit and then have a liedown.
Why are you going that way?
Oh, i'm all right. Are you?
Are you sure? Yeah?
Shall we send you something up from dinner?
Well, ma'am, what do want with me?
I'll stop that dog barking.
Here, lie down. Lie down.
You're making a mistake, you know.
I have a good memory for faces.
If that's all, you needn't have told me to come.
Oh, don't go.
You are playing a game with me.
Aren't you ashamed?
What harm have i done you?
You call this cricket?
No, my girl. Business.
What have i to do with this quarrel? I couldn't help their falling out.
It's your misfortune.
You're a rotter if you can spoil anyone's life who never did you an ounce of harm.
Oh, so they don't know about you, eh? Well, that's all right.
now, look here, mrs. Chloe. I serve my employer, but i'm flesh and blood, too.
And i give as good as i get.
I hate this family of yours.
There's no name too bad for them to call me this last week, no looks too bad to give me. I tell you frankly, i hate them.
There's good in them, same as in you.
Ah, there's no good hornblower but a dead hornblower.
But i'm not one?
No, but you'll be the mother of some, i shouldn't wonder.
Oh, leave me alone, do?
I'm happy here.
Be a sport.
You can't get round me , so don't try to.
Oh, it's such a bad time in the old days. Oh, do.
You might.
You've been fond of some woman, i suppose. Think of her.
Now, look here, mrs. Chloe.
You're only a small fry in this game, u. But i've got to use yo look here.
Don't you make an enemy of me.
I haven't been dragged through hell for nothing.
Women like me can fight, i can tell you.
Ah, that's better.
I'd rather have a woman threaten than whine any day. Go on, threaten away.
Look, there's some money.
It's all i've got.
Take it and drop me out, won't you?
You mistake your man, missy.
Don't you try those games on with me.
Oh, you're a beast.
A beast. A cruel, cowardly beast.
And how dare you bribe my man to spy on me. Oh, yes, you do.
You know you do. If you drove me mad, you wouldn't care, you beast.
Don't carry on.
It won 't get you anywhere.
I hope your mother and your sisters if you have any are going through what i've been going through ever since you got on my track.
I hope they'll know what fear means. I hope they'll love and find it's hanging on a thread.
Oh, you coward.
You bastard. You coward.
Calling yourself a man.
Oh, you're quite pretty like that.
You're a handsome woma n when you're aroused.
Is there anything you'll take not to mess up my life?
Now, look here, mrs. Chloe. I've got to go through with this.
I don't want anything you can give me, but i'll let you down as lightly as i can. Chloe!
Hello, chloe. What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you all over the place.
I thought i heard someone talking. No.
I think i'll go to my room now and have a liedown.
My head's splitting.
Aye, sure. It's damn cold out here.
I say, what, uh... what gives you these heads? Hmm?
You've been having the m for nearly a month now.
Except that i am going to have a child, charlie.
Are you glad?
I mean, i suppose i am.
It seems funny, somehow, you would be having a kid.
The governor will be mighty pleased, anyway.
Oh, don't tell him yet.
All right, poor old girl.
I saw you not well.
Kiss, kiss.
You're like fire. Are you all right?
Oh, not so bad.
Are you happy with me, charlie?
You wouldn't easily believe things against me, would you?
Oh, you're thinking of those hillcrists again.
This quarrel's getting on my nerves.
Yes, and we won't forget. We'll make them pay for it. Oh!
I didn't mean that can't you get your father to stop it, charlie?
Whatever for?
Now, look here, chloe. Here, do this. What's behind all this?
You're carrying on as if you were really scared.
Here, come sit down.
I tell you, we've got these people.
Why, they'll have them out of deepwater in 6 months.
It's absolute ruination to their beastly old house.
We'll put our chimneys on the very edge, not 300 yards off.
And our smoke will be drifting right over them.
Won't have this confounded, stuck-up woman here much longer.
And then we can really go ahead and take our proper place. So long as she's here, we shall never do that.
We've only got to drive on now as fast as we can.
You know, if you go on like this, i shall begin to think that... charlie!
You haven't started your dinner yet, have you?
You go down and i'll go to bed quite soon.
Don't stop loving me, charlie.
Stop? Not much.
Seeing you yesterday at the auction did seem rotten.
We didn't begin it.
No, but you don't understand. If you've made yoursel f as father has... i hope i should be sorry.
Now, that's not like you.
He can't help thinking he's a public benefactor.
And we can't help thinking he's a pig.
If the survival of the fittest is right... he may be the fitter, but he isn't going to survive.
It looks like it though.
Is that all you came to say?
Couldn't... couldn't we join together? Couldn't we stop it?
I don't feel like joining.
Well, we did shake hands.
You can't fight and not grow bitter.
I don't feel bitter. Oh, wait.
You will soon enough.
Oh, chloe.
I do think your mother'' 's manner to her is... well?
Well, snobbish.
She may not be in your class, but that's just why it's snobbish.
I think you better shut up.
What my father said was true.
Your mother's rudeness to her yesterday has made both he and charlie ever so much bitter.
Is this a whistling matter?
I suppose you want me to go.
Aren't we ever going to be friends again?
I don't expect so.
That's very horrible.
Lots of horrible things in this world.
It's up to us to make them pure, jill.
And be immoral?
That's the last thing i want to be. I only want to be friendly.
That would be a real first.
Yes, but... but from the big point of view... there isn't any.
We're all out for our own.
By jove, you have got... cynical?
Each man for himself.
That's the winner, hands down.
Mr. Dawker's here... now, this may come into court, you know, so if there's a weak point in any way, better administer it at once.
You are absolutely sure of the girl?
There's no question of it.
Here's a cutting of the actual case.
I brought my friend's partner with me. Is mr.
Hornblower coming?
At 11:00. But only after i had sent up a second note to him.
Squire's not in?
L... i haven't told him.
Well, i think our friends might wait in there, then we can use them when we want to.
Will you make yourselves comfortable?
I've had this drawn and engrossed. Pretty smart work.
It conveys that centry added long meadow to the squire for 4,500.
Now, mum, if hornblower puts his hand to that, he'll have been done in the eye and 6,000 out of pocket.
You will have a very nasty neighbor there.
But we shall still have the power to disclose that secret at any time?
Yeah, but things may happen you can't bring home to him. You can't trust a man like that.
He isn't likely to forgive me, i know.
But if he signs, we couldn't honor that.
No, no, ma'am.
I'm sure i don't want to do that girl a hurt.
I only mention it because of course, you can't guarantee that it won't get out.
It always seems to make more noise than any other.
But you leave him to us what you want.
And uh, i wouldn't mention this. The centry's no mortal good to him if he can't put up works.
I reckon he'll be glad to save what he can.
I've come to ask you point blank what you mean by writing me these letters.
I will discuss it in the presence of nobody, if you please.
Mr. Dawker knows just as much as i do, and more.
Your second note says that my daughter-in-law has lied to me.
Well, i've brought her.
, and what you've got to say if it's not just a trick to see me again, you will say to her face.
Mr. Hornblower, you'd better decide that after hearing what it is.
We shall be quite ready to repeat it in her presence, but... we want to do as little harm as possible... oh.
Well, what lies have you been hearing, eh?
Or what have you made up? You and mr. Dawker.
I suppose you know there's such a thing as the law of libel and slander. I'm not the man to stoop at that.
Are you familiar with the law of divorce, mr. Hornblower? No, i'm not.
Well, in that case... no misconduct is required.
I suppose you've heard that cases are arranged.
I know it's all very shocking.
What about it?
Some cases are arranged, mr. Hornblower. The man who is to be divorced often visits an hotel with a strange woman.
I'm extremely sorry to have to say that your daughter-in-law, before her marriage, was in the habit of being employed as such a woman.
It's all proved up to the hilt.
You're lying to save your skins!
How dare you tell me such monstrosities!
Dawker, i'll have you in a criminal court!
Oh, rats. You saw the gentleman that was with me yesterday? Well, he's employed her.
A put up job, sir!
A conspiracy!
Go and fetch your daughter-in-law.
It's a foul shame.
A lying slander.
And so it's easily disproved.
Go and fetch her.
Now, then, let's have this impudent story torn to rags.
You, my dear. When a woman who... oh, it's too shocking.
I don't know how to tell you.
When a woman that went with men to get them their divorce.
Who says that?
That's a charitabl e thing to say, isn't it?
Here, i'll have you both on your knees to her.
How do you do, mrs. Vane?
You've got a bad memory, ma'am. You knew me well enough yesterday.
A day's not a long time, nor 3 years.
Who are you? I don't know you, i say.
Let me refresh your memory, ma'am just on 3 years ago,
"october 3, fee and expenses mrs. Vane with mr. C.
If you like to have a look at the book, sir, you'll see the entries are quite genuine.
It's lies, a lot of lies.
Come, ma'am. We wish you no harm. Take me away.
I won't be treated like this.
Were you ever called vane?
No, never!
Don't tell charlie
I'm all at sea here.
Go out and wait for me in the car.
What do you want for this... secret?
Wonderful the trouble you've tak en for nothing.
If you harm us, we shall harm you... any use whatever of the centry.
For which you made me pay ³³9,500. We'll buy it from you.
What price?
The centry at the price miss mullins was willing to take it first.
Longmeadow at the price you gave up. $4,500 in all.
A fine price! And me 6,000 out of pocket.
No, no, i'll keep it.
And hold it over you.
You daren't tell the secret so long as i've got it.
Well, then, you go your own way, and we'll go ours.
There's no witness to this conversation.
By heaven! You're a clever woman.
Will you swear by almighty god that you and your family and that agent of yours won't breathe a word of this shocking thing to a mortal soul?
Yes... if you sell.
Where's dawker?
I suppose you've got your iniquity ready.
It's mighty near conspiracy, miss.
Have you got a testament?
My word will be enough... you will pardon me.
I can't make it solemn enough for you.
I'll get the bible.
It's a short conveyanc e of the centry and longmeadow.
Site sale by miss mullins, the first. John hillcrist, the second.
To that oath, mr. Hornblower, we shall add the words, "so long as the hornblower family do us no harm."
Take it in your hands, both of you.
Swear.
Swear by almighty god... i swear by almighty god... never to breathe a word of what i know... concerning... chloe hornblower... concerning chloe hornblower... to any living soul.
So long as the hornblower family do us no harm.
Oh, dada, she looked like a lost soul.
She committed her real crime when she married young hornblower without telling him she came out of a certain world to do it.
Is it very awful in that world, dada?
I don't know, jill some can stand it, i suppose.
Some can't.
One thing i'm... i don't know which sort she is.
One thing i'm sure of, she's awfully fond of charlie.
That's very ba and she's frightened horribly.
I think she's desperate.
I'm not enjoying her much tonight. I never could hate properly.
It's a confounded nuisance.
Mother's fearfully bucked, and dawker's simply oozing triumph.
I don't trust him, dodo.
He's too... not puglistic, but the other one with a "pug".
Pugnacious.
Hmm, he is, rather.
I'm sure he wouldn't care a tuppence if chloe committed suicide.
Nonsense, nonsense. I wonder if mother would.
I thought i heard... is there anyone out there?
Oh, come in.
It's only us.
Yes, do sit down. You're all shaky.
Is there anything i can do?
I couldn't bear it. He's coming to ask you.
Who?
I've got to be quick. He keeps on asking.
He knows there's something. Make your mind easy.
We shan't tell him oh, that's not enough.
Can't you tell him something to put him back to thinking it's all right?
I've done him such a wrong i didn't realize it till after.
I thought meeting him was such a wonderful piece of good luck
After all i'd been through i'm not such a bad lot.
Not really.
And then i met charlie.
He thought i was respectable, and that was such a relief, you can't think.
So i let him... well, after i married him, you see, i fell in love.
Oh, if i had of before, perhaps i wouldn't have dared. Only i don't know.
You don't know, do you?
When there's a straw going, you catch it.
Yes, of course you do.
I've been on hot brick s all these months, ever since the row started and dawker began to spy on me.
I knew it was in the wind. What gets in the wind never gets out. Never.
Just blows and then blows home.
Well, i paid for being a fool.
It isn't fun, that sor t of life, i can tell you.
Oh, i'm not ashamed and repentant and all that. If it wasn't for him.
I'm afraid he'll never forgive me. It's such a disgrace for him.
Being fond of him i feel it worse than anything i ever felt before, and that's saying a good bit.
He simply mustn't find out. Oh, that's it!
But he's bound to go on, because he knows there's something.
A man isn't going to be satisfied when there's something he suspects about his wife.
Charlie wouldn't never.
He's clever, and he's jealous, and he's coming here.
Couldn't we say something to put him clean off the scent?
Anything in reason. Oh, you will.
You see, i don't know what i'll do.
I've got soft being looked after.
He does love me.
And if he throws me off, i shall go under, that's all.
Have you any suggestion?
The only thing is to tell him something positive, something he'll believe that's not too bad.
Like my having been a lady clerk for those people who came here this morning and having been dismissed on suspicion of taking money.
I'll get him to believe that that wasn't true.
Yes, and it isn't. Oh, that's splendid!
You would put just conviction into it.
Don't you think so, dada?
It's all unspeakably sad.
Deceptions horribly against the grain... when i deceived him, i would deceive god himself, i was so miserable!
You've never been brought down in the mud.
You don't know what i've been through yes, yes, i daresay i should have done the same.
I should be the last to judge. There, there, cheer up.
There's somebody at the door!
Oh, i forgot.
It's locked.
Charles hornblower. Is my wife here?
No, sir.
Has she been here? This morning, i believe. Jill?
Yes, she came this morning.
I know that. Now, i mean.
Tell me what was said this morning.
I wasn't here this morning.
Don't try and put me off. I know too much.
Shall i go, dad?
No, i will. Won't you sit down?
Well, it appears that my agent, mr. Dawker... that my agent happens to know the firm who in the old days employed your wife.
I should greatly prefer not to say anymore, especially as we don't believe the stories. No, we don't.
What else?
Charlie, if i were you, i should refuse to listen to anything against my wife. Go on, i tell you.
If you insist.
Well, they say there was some question of the accounts, that your wife left under a cloud.
T. So i told you we don't believe i liars!
What did you say?
What did you tell me that for?
When i've just had the truth out of that little rat?
My wife has been here.
I know she put you up to it, liar that she is.
For years, nothing but lies.
She hasn't the pluck to come and tell me. I've finished with her.
I wouldn't own a child by a woman like that.
For god's sake, ma n, think what you're saying.
She's in great distress.
She loves you, you know.
Fine love.
That scoundrel dawker told me... told me that... it's horrible.
I'm terribly sorry that our quarrel should have brought this about.
Yes, you smashed my life.
Would you have wished to remain on in ignorance?
Oh, i don't know, but you did it.
You shouldn't have attacked us.
What did we do to you compared with this?
All you could.
What can we do to help you?
Tell me where my wife is.
Then she was here.
Dada, i'm awfully afraid oughtn't we to look for her?
I saw her there listening.
One never knows what may happen.
You go to the gravel pit, jill, and i'll go to the pond.
No, we'll go together.
Oh, fellowes, i want somebody to go down for mr.
Mr. Dawker's here, madam, waiting to see you.
Well, ask him to come in, and fellowes, you can tell the jackmans that they can go back to that cottage.
What's all this about charles hornblower?
He came to me, and i told him i knew nothing. He wouldn't take it and went for me, said he knew everything.
Then he started to threaten me, and i lost my temper, and i told him.
That's very seriou s, dawker... after our promise.
My husband is most upset.
It isn't my fault, ma'am.
He shouldn't have threatened me and goaded me on like that.
Besides, it's got out as a scandal, common talk in the village.
Oh, not the facts, of course, but quite enough to cook their goose here.
They'll have to go.
Better have done with anyway than have enemies at your door.
Take charge of this, dawker.
These people are desperate, and i'm not sure of my husband when his feelings are aroused.
You better wait.
He better not give me any of his sauce. I've had enough.
Give me that deed.
You got it out of me by false pretenses and treachery.
You swore that nothing should be heard of this. Why, me own servants know.
That's nothing to do with us. Your son wrenched the knowledge from mr. Dawker by abuse and tricks, that's all.
You better behave yourself, or i shall ask that you be shown out.
Give me that deed... you little ruffian, i see it in your pocket.
Get the brandy, quick!
No!
Stand back, young woman.
I want no help from any of you.
Take her to the car.
Hillcrist... you've got me beaten.
And disgraced hereabouts.
You've ruined my son's married life, and you've killed... my grandchild.
I'm not staying in this cursed spot, but if ever i can do you or yours a hurt
i will.
Hornblower, in the presence of what may be death, with all my heart i'm sorry.
You... hypocrite!
Jackmans, madam.
We're so glad we can go along back, sir.
Ma'am... we wanted to thank you, sir.
Thank you kindly.
Good night, sir.
I'd forgotten their existence.
What is it that gets loose when you start a fight and makes you what you think you're not?
Begin as you may, it ends in this skin game.
When we began this fight, we had clean hands.
Are they clean now?
What's gentility worth if it can't stand fire?
Subtitles:
Hello! What? A murder?
That ain't news. We had three yesterday.
Los Angeles is on fire?
All right. I'll send a man down.
A car parked on the wrong side of the street?
Call out for reserves, will ya?
Reserves!
And then she says I love you, Reginald.
Hey, Sherlock.
Did you hear about the jewel robbery at the ball last night?
Oh, go on away!
I'm writing one of them scenarios.
Hey, now, just a minute, you great big flat-footed cop!
You better listen to me! Somebody stole Norma Shearer's jewels.
Well? What of it?
They stole 'em from us!
Why, the dirty crooks!
Inspector Kane speaking.
What? I'll get right over with two of my best men.
Come on! Go home, go home!
Didn't you hear me? I said go home.
You can't sit around here dirtying this place up eating ice-cream.
Miss Shearer won't like it. Miss Shearer she bought it for us.
Oh, of course, that's different.
You sweet little dears.
Hey! The cops!
Where'll you be when I need you?
Right here.
I told you not to make that last payment.
Of course I've lost them.
Don't sit there looking as though I hadn't.
I wouldn't have lost them for the world. They were all mementos.
But uhm...
Hedda, don't talk so much!
But uhm... I've looked there, too. But...
I've looked there already. But who was there?
Well, let me see.
I was with Billy Haines... Jack Gilbert...
We don't want any!
Whether you want it or not, you're gonna get it!
Joan Crawford...
Miss Shearing.
Oh, Inspector. I've been waiting for you.
Did you ever lose any jewels before?
Why, no, sir. Not this week.
Do you suspect anyone?
My nerves are so shocked I suspect everyone.
You weren't at the ball, were you?
Why, no, mam.
I never go...
Ah, you hesitate.
You've found them! Oh, isn't he a lovely man.
Do give them to me.
Calm yourself, lady. I'll find your jewels or die.
I wish you would!
Huh? Joan, you mean you actually took it.
Yes. You see, I came home from the dance with it hidden under my wrap... for fear someone would take it from me.
Well, Joan, if we weren't such good friends, I'd say...
You'd say what?
I won't say it.
If you'd wanted something all your life and fate laid it right in your palm?
Grab it and run like... Hm-hmm. Like you did.
But you have to take it back.
No, I'll never take it back.
Oh, yes you will.
Come on, hand it over!
Who are you? Inspector Kane.
I heard what you said.
You stole Miss Shearer's jewels.
Here's what I took.
Miss Lee, I'd like to ask you...
I know, you want my autograph.
Oh, forget it. Excuse me, Mr. Lowe, but I want to ask you about the ball last night.
You know, you were there with this lady.
Get out, get out!
Yes, sir. So you double crossed me, uh?
You know? I don't think they like me.
Oh, I didn't wait for the answer.
Go on back and find out.
Yes, mam.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, please. I forgot to wait for the answer.
Hey, listen. If you don't get out of here, I'll send you back to Poland in a pine box.
Not Poland. Sweden.
All right, Sweden.
Oh, he's a nice fellow. He's going to send me to Sweden.
Come on with me.
Mr. McLaglen, can I talk to you?
What is it? Norma Shearer's jewels were stolen last night.
Do you know anything about them?
Are you insinuating that I took them?
No, I'm only asking you.
Now you see what you've done? He won't send me back to Sweden.
Oh, yes he will.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself hitting a little Norwegian like that.
Says who?
Says me! Excuse me gentlemen. I 'm not from Norway.
That picture should be over on the left.
No, it should be over on the right.
Is that so?
Yes, and so are you.
I wanna see Winnie Lightner.
807! Thank you.
How did you know she was in 807?
Oh, for the love of my hosier shirt, I'll be right there.
Hello? Inspector Kane speaking. Can I see you now, Miss Lightner?
Good gracious! I hope not!
Fifi, a package of cigarettes.
What kind, monsieur?
Chesterfield.
Do you want a match? I get one for you.
Hum, señorita?
I see you are very popular with the ladies, yes?
I like all the pretty girls.
Oh... some matches?
Well, such popularity must be deserved.
You flatter me.
Pardon me. Mr. Baxter. Did you attend that ball last night?
Oh, no, no. I'm so sorry, but I do not dance in English.
I know you. You're miss Irene Dunne, aren't you?
Yes, I'm Irene Dunne.
What do you know about those stolen jewels?
Jewels?
Were they in a purple box? Yes!
With a silver padlock?
Yes! And a gold ribbon wrapped around them? Yes!
I never saw them.
You know, I'm still nervous.
What you need is a cup of coffee.
Hey, waiter, bring me a cup of coffee.
Just as soon as I can get to you.
I don't like that guy.
I don't think he's a waiter. At least he don't act like one.
Oh, yes he does.
I think he's a crook.
Wait a minute, I'll ask him.
Son, are you a crook?
I mean. What is your business?
I'm Inspector Kane.
What did I tell you?
What do you mean? Well, if you're an inspector, what are you doing here?
Shhh! I'm looking for pearls.
Why don't you try the oysters?
Let me tell you something. This is serious.
There was a ball given last night...
Yeah, it's still on the menu.
What's on the menu?
Codfish ball. Listen, this is serious.
This ball was given for ladies and gentlemen.
We weren't there then.
The jewels were stolen from Norma Shearer.
Does she work here?
No, she don't. But I'm gonna get those jewels.
You know anything about it. Wait a minute.
If there was a ball given last night and any jewels were stolen... had we been there, he would have gotten them.
Now why make a crack like that?
I had nothing... Hey, did you ever steal anything?
Wait a minute. Better let me handle this. Wait a minute.
What do you mean by doing that?
He told me to do it.
You tell everything you know, don't you?
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Did you ever do this before? Yes. In Rio Rita we did...
Pardon me, Mr. Dix. I'm a detective.
Where can I find Lowell Sherman?
A detective?
Yes. Well, you ought to know where to find him. By the way, how did you know I was Richard Dix?
Well, you guess where Lowell is, will you?
Embrace him. You don't thank him and them kiss him.
But naturally I thank him and then kiss him.
There are different kinds of embraces.
Tommy, did you get that man who plays the detective? Yes, sir.
Right here. Oh.
Who are you?
I'm a detective. No, you're not. You won't do.
Come on, Phil, will ya?
Get that.
Come on, Gallager, get this other one.
No, Maybe.
Maybe. Have you birds got your copy ready?
No!
Maybe. Well, have you got it or haven't you got it?
Oh, it's you, Mr. Cooper.
Put em down.
Hang em up!
Put em down, hang em up. What do you think we're running here? An almanac?
I need a new typewriter ribbon... Oh, Wynne!
Here's the story of the film ball last night.
Sure! I had a great time.
I left before it started.
Hey, chief, fresh story.
Norma Shearer's jewels were stolen last night at the movie ball.
No one arrested but everyone suspected.
Now isn't that unusual.
Just like the weather out here.
Say, you know? I wish Philo Vance was here.
Who? Philo Vance.
Say, Bud! Why don't you get in touch with that French detective friend of yours? That er, Maurice Chandelier.
Hollywood 2400, please.
Yes? Hello, Buddy!
Wasn't that a grand party last night?
Yes, I wonder if they found any trace of those stolen jewels.
Shhh! I know you.
You're Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.
Them's fighting words, stranger.
Well, anyway, this is Miss... Everybody knows her. Loretta Young.
Don't talk! Answer my questions.
Will everything we say be used against us?
So you've hocked the jewels, have you?
You dropped that yourself.
Pardon me just a minute. Are you Richard Barthelmess?
Why, uhm...
No. There he is, right over there.
Clever fellow. What a makeup. Pardon me.
Mr. Barthelmess, I want to talk to you.
I'm not Barthelmess.
No?
Louise Fazenda. Pardon me, Mr. Butterworth, you're wanted on the set immediately.
Hm? What's a three-letter word for perfection?
You, darling.
Flatterer.
What's a five-letter word for me?
Jewel, sweetheart.
Frank Fay?
Yes. Do you know anything about those stolen jewels?
Why...
Oh, Barbara Stanwyck. May I present Mr. Fay.
We know each other.
We're married.
Why, of course. Do you know anything about those stolen jewels?
Shh! I've just written the most beautiful piece of poetry.
Really? Well, I gotta go.
Just a second.
Let's hear it. Oh, no, there's more.
Wait. In a year or so the girl returned and mighty proud was she.
She told how she'd done her duty in the great war or the sea.
She told how she picked up the wounded and held each one to her breast.
So the wood workers got together and made her a cedar chest.
Well, I'll see you around sometime, I guess.
Kindly come in the garden, please.
Hey, wait a minute.
Which one of you two are Jack Oakie?
Say, Jack Oakie, what's your name?
Oh, er... yes, sir.
Were you at the ball last night?
The ball?
Let me see. Oh, no, I wasn't at the ball. I was playing some miniature bridge with some The Singer's midgets.
Now wait a minute. Don't you get fresh with me.
Now wait. You're going too far, fellow. Don't you want to say what's your business with me?
What do you mean? I want to see you later, then...
I know, but we've got a big scene to do here.
The kissing scene, is that it?
Come on, take em off. I know you.
Come on, take em off.
Take em off, I tell you.
No, I won't take mine off unless you don't take yours off first.
Oh, yes, you will!
Oh, no I won't!
So it's you, is it?
Were you present when those jewels were stolen?
Uhm, no, no, no. How do I know?
Well, because if I was there I'd have hollered for help.
How loud can you holler for help?
How loud?
Hello, Hank. Do you want me?
Here's that piece of cheese.
They call it "The Stolen Jools".
Take it away before the Board of Health gets here.
I'll take it out and bury it.
That's a good idea, Billy.
Hey, wait a minute! Come here!
"The Stolen Jools".
What? The Stolen Jools.
Just what I'm looking for. So I've caught you in the act, have I?
Oh, but I didn't do it.
You didn't do it?
No, I didn't do it!
Just a moment, please. I have a secret.
Mitzi Green! You stole the jewels?
No. I was at that ball. And when I saw Edward Robinson and George E. Stone put this box in a drawer...
And I've always been taught that honesty is the best policy.
So, I just took it myself.
Mitzi, you've saved the plot of the story.
And the moral of the story is...
Never spank a child on an empty stomach.
Come on, ace.
Come on, Joe, double or nothing.
Not me, Nick.
I've paid you double too many times.
Well, faint heart never won fair lady, or fat turkey.
Come on, Joe, what do you say?
Heads or tails? Uh...
I say tails.
I never seen such a lucky stiff.
Better luck next time, Joe.
Well, I guess we got enough money to close up now.
Say, is that my tie?
When I got up this morning, I sort of...
Yeah, well, why didn't you put on that new checkered suit of mine while you were about it? - Heh-heh-heh.
It didn't fit.
Who do you like in the last race at Louisville?
Well, I got my dough on Abie Kabbible.
- You think he'll win?
- Why, sure he'll win.
Nothing else, he'll win by a nose.
- Smart fella, this boy.
- I'm looking for action tonight myself.
- Well, don't worry, boy, you'll get it.
Mr. Nick, there's a lady outside what wants to see you.
How do you know she's a lady, Snake Eyes?
Well, boss, she's got a skirt on.
- All right, I'll see her.
- Don't forget to remember, boss.
Lucky with the cards, unlucky with the love.
That's a lot of bunkaroo.
Don't you forget to remember...
- Little Nick is lucky with the women too.
I don't know.
- Sometime, you'll pick the wrong filly. - Not a chance.
Nothing but favorites in my stable.
My lady, here I come.
- Oh, hello, baby.
I've got to have some money right away, Nick.
Well, what's up?
- How much do you need?
- I've got to have a hundred dollars.
Well, you know Nick.
I never go back on my word, sister.
I wouldn't have asked you for it if I didn't have to have it.
Sure, I know. I know you wouldn't.
- Gee, you're a swell fellow.
- Well, I'm glad to do it, baby. Glad to do it.
I've gotta be going now, Nick.
Oh, back so soon, eh?
- A dame wanting me to step out with her.
I've got holes in my socks from kicking skirts away.
Let's see what the boys in the backroom have got to offer.
Running into house and lot.
Who'll give me half a dollar for my hand?
I wouldn't give you a nickel for your whole body.
Oh, Mr. Nick.
- Let's see you do it.
- Come, dice. Hah!
Eight's the point.
A dollar I comes, Mr. Nick. Bet.
Bet it is.
Half a cigar, he shoots.
- Six and he wants eight.
- Eight from Decatur. Hah.
Read them and weep.
Seven and you're through.
- Up pops the devil. Ha-ha-ha.
- Mr. Nick.
You sure is one lucky white man.
You got carfare home, Snake Eyes?
No, sir, I ain't, boss.
I ain't got a red cent.
Then here, take this fin.
Stay out of this game from now on.
Don't you kid yourself. He had you on the run...
- Come on, come on, who shoots next?
Come on, your dice, man.
All right, get your money ready, Nick.
- Hey, let me in here.
Hey, what are you doing, kibitzing the game?
No, I got dough.
Well, we're not taking any two-bit bets tonight, Sport.
Well, I'm not making any two-bit bets tonight.
Whew. - That look like two bits to you?
This is big-time.
- I'll shoot 10 of that.
- Shoot all or nothing.
- You'll shoot the C-note or nothing.
- You can't tell me...
You heard me, the hundred or nothing.
Shoot the piece.
This is big game now.
- Get up and leave. The dough is piling up.
Three and two.
Point is five.
- Six, and he wants five. - Uh-oh.
- Seven, makes him a loser.
And the prisoner ate a hearty breakfast.
- Well, that cleans me.
- Well, come on, move along.
- Come on, breeze.
And as you go out that door, take that "welcome" sign off it.
Hey, boss, what do you got against this Sport?
- I don't like the way he parts his hair. Ha-ha-ha.
- Who shoots next?
- You're too tough for me.
- It's not for us.
- I don't want any.
Nick, you're wasting your time in a small tank like this.
You should be in that big game in the city.
Why, Hickory Short would be a cinch for you.
- You ain't kidding me, are you?
- I'm on the level.
This town's getting soft for me.
How much would it take to buck that game?
Well, a fella shouldn't try to unless he had at least $ 10,000. Whew.
That's a lot of dough. Ooh.
- Ten thousand bucks.
I'll have that someday.
And when I do, I'll show those city birds something.
Say, listen, why don't we make up a pool and stake Nick to that big game?
- I'll go for a little of it.
- You mean that, kid?
Sure, you can have all I got.
I could raise 5000 on the barbershop.
I put in $ 1000, what I was gonna send back for my wife to bring her here.
Oh, no, no, no, don't do that. Ha-ha.
Well, look, maybe I'm better off if I don't send it so I can't lose nothing anyhow.
I'll put in a hundred.
I'll put in 200.
You can have all I've got.
I'll back you anytime.
We're all with you.
Blondie, what do say about us two going to the big city, huh?
Boys, you're on.
Attaboy, Nicky, you'll knock them for a loop.
- Here, Mr. Nick, I'll put in $5.
We can't lose now.
Too much from a guy now, will you?
- Not too.
- Bye, write me a letter and get fat, will you?
Just keep that in your pocket, Mr. Nick, and you'll win for sure.
Oh, thanks, Snake Eyes.
Say, I've practically got that big city sugar in my kick right now.
Come here, give me luck.
Here, Nick, here's my home office address.
You can send my share there.
- I'll send you back your grand and your cut. Okay.
You all understand, I pay back your original investment and we split the winnings 50-50.
That's right.
How much you think you're gonna win?
I'll win so much, you can send back to the old country for your wife and your sweetheart too.
Well, now, look here, young squirt, you keep that barbershop going.
Sorry to see you go, Nick.
Well, soon as I make my killing, I'll send for you, and that won't be long.
- Here's your ride.
- I'll be waiting.
- Well. - Good luck with those big-city blonds.
Yeah, well, this is the only blond that I'm true to.
Say, conductor, what time do we get to the big city?
We're due in there at 6:42.
And we've never been late yet.
Well, I bet you 10-to-5 we don't make it.
Nice ride.
Telegram for Mr. L.S. Johnson.
Mr. L.S. Johnson, please.
- Everything satisfactory, Mr. Venizelos?
Fine hotel you got here.
Where's the barbershop?
- It's right downstairs, sir.
Oh, by the way, you haven't seen Hickory Short around here today, have you?
You mean Hickory Short, the gambler?
- He doesn't live here.
I heard he hung out here.
Well, not in this hotel.
Say, you don't happen to know in which room the big roving poker game is going on tonight, do you?
We don't permit anything like that around this hotel.
Thanks. Heh-heh.
I'd like a heater, miss.
- Heater?
- Yeah, a cigar.
I've never heard them called that before.
Any particular brand?
Oh, about two bits or better, if you got them.
These are very nice.
I can recommend them.
You smoke them yourself?
Well, they are good. Hmm.
Look awfully good.
I'll take four or five of these.
- How much are they?
- They're a dollar apiece.
Well, that's the price.
All right. Ahem.
Here you are, lady.
Say, what are these things for?
Poker dice.
Oh, you gamble with them?
Yes, sir, it's a dollar if you lose.
If you win, you get $2 worth of merchandise.
Anything behind the counter?
Anything in merchandise. Heh-heh.
Well, you're a cute little package.
Would you like to roll the dice?
I'm a little green at this sort of thing.
Poker dice, one flop.
- Hard to beat, lady. Heh-heh-heh.
- Well, come on, let's see you do it.
I'm for you.
Two fours.
- Three fours, one on me.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Well, here goes again.
Make it easy for you this time.
That's a cinch.
- I'd beat it with my eyes closed.
- I bet you can too.
- Come on, let's see you do it.
Ha-ha-ha. - Here goes.
Oh, two fours.
- Well, I'm sorry. Sorry, lady. - Two on me.
Ha-ha.
Say, you're a cute little trick.
Well, better still, straight six high.
- Beat that.
- You must have beginner's luck.
- But I'll beat it even yet. - Come on, let's see you do it.
Come on.
- There's a straight.
- I'm sorry, baby, but you lose.
Five high, mine was six high.
Say, look here. You better quit this.
I hate to see a nice little girl like you lose her job.
That's three games on the house.
My, but you're lucky.
Do you gamble much?
Oh, I take a little flyer every once in a while.
For big money?
Do I look like a tinhorn?
- I should say not. - Heh-heh-heh.
Well, how much do I owe you?
Three dollars, and you get $6 worth of merchandise.
What will you have?
I got my eye on that big box of candy right there.
- That's just $6.
- Well, I'll have it.
- Shall I wrap it up for you?
- No, no, no. You keep it, baby.
Oh, I don't think I can do that. I mean...
No, that's all right.
I don't eat candy. Gets in my teeth.
Well, that's too bad for you.
- Yeah. - But my good luck.
Look here...
You know, I'm a stranger in town.
How'd you like to come out and have dinner with me tonight?
My mother doesn't let me stay out at night.
- Are you sure you won't change your mind? - Oh, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I'm glad you like it here.
It's very good, let me tell you that.
It's one of the best seafood places I've ever been at. Ahem.
- I thought you'd like it. - Great java too.
Not a bad cigar you sold me.
I always say you can tell a gentleman by the kind of cigar he smokes.
Of course, at home, I smoke my own brand.
- Yeah? - A fellow in Havana makes them up for me.
- You don't say. - Hmm.
Say, Marie, you know most of the regulars that hang around the hotel, don't you?
Well, yes.
Well, ever see Hickory Short around?
You know, the big gambler.
Well, he's an awfully nice fellow.
He's around all the time.
You don't happen to know which room they're holding the game?
I happen to know. You won't say I told you.
Not a word.
Come on, tell me, sister.
Mr. Short ordered some cigars to be sent up to his room this afternoon.
- And it's 346.
Boy, am I itching to get in that game. Ho-ho-ho-ho.
I hope you don't think I'm butting in, Mr. Venizelos.
Call me Nick.
All right, Nick.
Attagirl. Heh-heh.
Say, we getting along swell, aren't we? Heh.
- What is it you're gonna say, baby?
- You've been so nice to me and all.
I was just going to suggest that you put some money in the hotel safe.
- Yeah? - For carfare home, in case you...
There won't be any in case, sister.
All right, I got an idea.
Now, you keep this for me.
- A hundred dollars?
Why, I couldn't. - Yeah.
You keep this for me, baby.
After the game, I'll make you a present of it.
And if I lose...
Gee, it sounds funny to hear myself saying "lose. "
Well, if I should lose, I'll need it for cigar money.
But you don't know me, I might run away with it.
Now, listen, sister, I'm a gambler.
It's my business to read human nature, to know people.
- And I can tell that you're on the level.
- But you could put it in the hotel safe.
Oh, no. You're safe enough for me, baby.
Well, all right, if you insist.
Attagirl. Come on, put it in the sock.
Heh-heh.
I'd like to see Hickory Short.
Well, I'm Hickory Short.
Well, I'm Nick Venizelos from Irontown.
- Nick the Barber, they call me. - Oh.
- Come in, Mr. Venizelos.
I've often heard of you.
Yeah? Heh-heh.
Have you any way of identifying yourself?
Why, yes, I...
Gee, I forgot my badge.
- "Nick Venizelos. "
- You didn't miss many of them, did you?
Well, here's the convincer.
- That's me in the middle. - Hmm.
Well, I guess you're yourself, all right.
I'm glad to meet you after all the stories I've heard about your luck, Mr. Venizelos.
- Oh, call me Nick. - Hmm.
- All right, Nick.
- Attaboy, Hick. Heh.
You know, I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.
- For a little action?
Heh-heh. - How'd you guess?
I want you to meet some of the boys.
- King's high.
Boys, I want you to meet Mr. Venizelos. Ahem.
- Mr. Tompkins.
- Honest John Tompkins?
- Oh, glad to know you, John.
- Mr. River.
- Old Deep River himself, eh?
In person. Not a motion picture, Nick.
Heh-heh-heh.
- Mr. Shultz.
- Back-to-Back Shultz.
You're the fella that almost broke the bank at Monte Carlo.
- Guilty. Glad to know you, Nick.
- Well, I'm glad to know you, Shultz.
And Mr. Barnes.
- I don't like them from the bottom, brother.
I'll make an exception in your case.
- Hello. - Have some grape, Nick?
Well, thanks, I don't much mind if I do. Yeah.
Fizz water, huh? Heh-heh.
Very good, Hickory.
Where'd you get it?
I'd like to get a case.
I'll send you around a case tomorrow.
Well, maybe I'll be better able to pay for it tomorrow.
- Well, I'll send it to you anyhow. - Hmm.
How about a little game of skill and chance?
Well, I've heard of such things.
What do you like to play?
Five-card stud.
How does that suit you?
- What's the limit?
- The roof.
Now, Nick, we're all friends here.
Of course, we ain't playing marbles, but we don't want no arguments.
- Anything ain't right, you just say so.
- Waiter?
Bring a half a dozen new decks of cards. Regular backs. Hmm?
- Well, go on, stupid.
- Anything the guest wants.
- Heh-heh-heh. Yes, sir.
- What's the matter? Ain't those cards good?
Just an old barbershop custom.
A fresh towel with every shave is my motto.
Here, give me 5 G.
Four there?
If you run out of those, there's more where they come from.
Brother, before the night's over, you'll be buying them from me.
- Well, you're an optimist anyhow.
- That's the way to be, Nick.
Say, what are these yellows?
Thousands?
- What are the blues?
Blues are hundreds.
- All right, boys?
- Come on, ace me, big boy.
Well, a pair of aces.
Looks like you made them, Nick.
A seven.
- I didn't do too well.
Six is a pair.
And a little deuce, a pair of aces.
Bet they're high.
Well, that cleans me out, boys.
Looks like I'm on my way to the cleaners too.
- Never say die.
- Raise you.
Well, that'll have to be a side bet.
Well, I'll call.
Pair of aces with a queen.
I think I got you, Hickory.
Aces, king next.
- Yes, you're right.
- Jacks and sixes. - Whew.
- What a pot.
- Old Back-to-Back Shultz.
Well, Nick, the luck's certainly running against you tonight.
Yeah. Oh, it's just a matter of the breaks. Heh-heh.
Don't worry about me, boys.
My brother works in the mint.
- Good morning, Mr. Venizelos.
"Knocked them dead. " Hmm.
I don't know, but it's plenty heavy.
- Is that all, sir?
Say, girlie, where's Marie?
Oh, you mean the girl that worked here? - Yeah.
I just got a call to report here this morning.
You don't mind if I put my hat on top of yours?
- It's all right, sir.
What's the idea, young man?
Give me my paper back. Oh.
I like your nerve, you...
Well, well, if it isn't Nick.
Well, it ain't his sister.
I'm awfully glad to see you.
I didn't think you'd get out of that other game.
Hickory, that was nice of you to send me that fizz water.
Don't mention it. Pleasure's mine.
- How are you? - Hello, Nick.
You locate some fresh money, Nick? Heh-heh.
Well, I told you, my brother works in the mint.
You know, it ain't so tough when you got friends.
Come on, sit in, Nick.
You can't get even standing up.
I'm glad you got out of that other game.
You'd be better company.
Sit in, Nick, the water's fine.
They're taking me tonight.
Well, do you think you can afford it, big boy?
Can he afford it?
Oh, you ain't got any chips yet, Nick.
- I'll take 3000.
No use holding up the deal.
That's all right, plenty of time.
Don't be in a hurry.
There they are, Nick, the same values as yesterday.
- Mm. - King bets 50.
Come again, Shultzy, 50 more.
You're too tough for me, boys. Fight it out.
- I scram.
- And 50 more to you.
- I stay.
- Call.
King, six, nine, the eight.
- The king, six is high.
You bet, Shultz.
Well, you can't have anything in check. Heh-heh.
I bet a blue.
- I'll call it.
Make it three.
All right, I'll stay.
Stay.
Coming up, you caught a five.
You caught the ace, you caught the other ace.
Ace, jack is high.
Your bet.
Well, I'll check to the raise.
Bet a half a yellow.
Well, how about making it a full yellow, just for good luck, eh?
- That's okay.
- I'll see it.
Here's the card that tells the story.
You caught a nine.
The ace, king, the 10.
The ace, king is high.
Your bet, Nick.
Well, ace, king bets five blues.
- Well, I'll make it a yellow.
Well, I got so much confidence in my hand, I'll tap myself for a yellow and red.
All right, I'll call it.
- Shultz is calling.
Kings are good, I guess.
Well, I think I top you, Hickory.
You win. Looks like your lucky day. - Whew.
That's the works.
Sweet pot.
This Nick the Barber's just a gambling fool.
And here you are, Barnes.
Here's my 3000 back.
I'll play these.
You keep these, Nick.
Keep them, pay for them.
You ain't got enough velvet to see yourself through a bad hand.
- That's all right. If I need them, I'll buy.
- Well, buy them now.
Well, why buy when I already got some?
See, I got enough here to see me through a long way.
Well, that ain't the idea.
You come here, sit in cold, you sit in without any dough...
- What do you mean without any dough?
- I know you got dough.
Well, what then?
Well, it just ain't being done.
You cash in your chips when you're through.
Oh, what's the difference, Hickory?
It's my game.
It's gonna be played according to house rules.
Here, pay me off.
I blew another game to come up here tonight.
We ain't running any credit game.
You ain't in Irontown now.
- Let's see your dough.
- You saw my dough yesterday, 10 grand.
- Yeah? Well, yesterday was another day.
- Well, pay me off.
You trying to pull a fast one?
Who do you think you're playing with, a lot of chumps?
- Come, show him your dough.
- I don't show you nothing.
You cheap bunch of chiselers.
Hickory Short, huh?
Didn't take you long to get out of that can.
- How have you been, Sleepy Sam? Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah, and Two-Time Phil.
- Well, what about it?
- You guys ain't gamblers. You're burglars.
How'd you like to show your racket to the police?
Why, you smalltime squealer, you tinhorn from the sticks...
- Ah-ah-ah. Do I get my dough?
- You get nothing.
- Well, I'll show you.
Get back...
Well, hello, baby.
You must have the wrong apartment.
Why, you remember me.
You remember, I gave you that hundred bucks to keep for me.
Say, what is this?
It's the big city, Hiram.
Why, you're a shelf for those burglars.
Stole the money that belonged to my friends.
Come on, open that door.
If that's the way you play the game in this town, I'll play it the same way.
Only I'll play it in spades. That means you'll pay double.
Why, you hustling little bag.
I'll have you begging for a cup of coffee.
And as for that dope of yours, I'll run him right into the lake.
What's the noise all about, monkey?
- Oh, how are you, Mr. Amenoppopolus?
Step right in. Well...
- How about a shave today? - Nice to see you.
And you shall have it.
Well, nice to see you again.
I haven't seen you in some time now.
Where do you get your...?
Oh, excuse me just a minute. Ahem.
Well, did you get the job, boy?
Just missed out on it.
Which makes it an even eight.
I told you not to come here until I had dough to send for you.
Yeah, I know, but I couldn't stand that small burg any longer, Nick, after you left.
Well, it'll be all right.
You'll find a job.
- Had any lunch? - Heh.
Then here's 2 bucks.
Now, put this on Flying Feet in that third race at Churchill Downs.
And here's two bits for your lunch.
Now go on and put on the feed bag.
Pardon me, Mr. Amenoppopolus, but I had to speak to an old friend of mine.
- It's all right, Nick.
- Once over, same as usual? - Yeah.
- Don't shave it too close, Nick.
My face is very tender today.
- Nice weather we're having. - Mm-hm.
Great for the races.
Yeah, I'm glad it isn't raining.
The track is gliding fast, Nick.
Heh-heh. Oh, well, that doesn't make any difference to me.
Say, I can pick mudders just as easily as fair weather horses anytime.
- You little wizard. By the way...
- Yeah?
Who do you like in the fifth race at Louisville?
I got a little bet on No Regrets.
Before I forget, shoot this for me in the game tonight.
How've you been doing lately?
I've been doing swell, Mr. Amenoppopolus.
The boys in the shop have been staking me to the club game.
And I won quite a lot of jack for them, and a little bit for myself.
They've been making a pool for you, huh?
Yeah, that's the idea, but that's just bush-league money.
Oh, if I have some really important dough I could get into that big game where the sugar is sweet.
Why, how much would it take to get into that big game?
Oh, about 10 grand.
- Ten thousand, huh?
- Yeah, 10,000, Mr. Amenoppopolus.
And what I know now about the racket I could trim them plenty. Heh-heh-heh.
I tell you, Peter, he is the luckiest man in the world. - Ha-ha.
- How do you know it, Alex?
How do I know?
- I've been staking him in a small way. - Yeah.
And he won for me every time.
- Haven't I though, huh?
Ha-ha-ha. - Sure.
Now, if we can put him in the big game, I'm sure we can win big money.
Boy. Ha-ha.
Well, I tell you, Alex, if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me for to take a chance.
- I'm not a gambling man, you know that. - Yeah?
But you can count on me for 3000.
You won't regret it, I tell you.
My luck is running great these days.
Fine. I'll get the cash and send it over.
- Let's step across the street and see Mr. Dondolos and his four brothers.
They usually like a little sport.
Yes, and let's not forget Mr. Agranopolis.
- No. Sure. - We mustn't hurt his feelings.
- Can't I put more money in?
- No, you've put in enough, boy.
You'll be getting plenty.
You'll be backing up that truck of yours at the bank every day.
- You watch it.
That's great. - Thanks, Pete.
- Goodbye, I appreciate it.
Goodbye. - Good luck.
If you don't mind, I'd like to return these.
The boy brought me more than I needed.
- All right, do you want the cash for them?
- Lf you please.
Buy yourself a cigar.
That was a nifty girl you had last night.
She wasn't bad, was she?
I think she's not very good either.
Follow me. You'll find I don't do so bad either.
You're a regular sheik, aren't you?
Not bad out here, boy.
You think she had a sister?
I think it's the mustache.
What's wrong with this place?
It's only me, Sam.
Nick the Barber.
Well, Nick, hello, how are you?
How are you, Nick?
- My name is Nick Venizelos, what's yours?
- Simpson, how are you?
Well, I haven't seen you in six months.
It's taken me that long to catch up with you.
Go on, play your hand out.
Will anybody open?
It's up to you, Sam.
Well, I can't do anything with these.
It's by me.
You looking prosperous, Nick.
Hey, now listen, you mugs, no use chicken-scratching around.
I got something to say to you, especially to you.
I've had some time to think things over.
I'm gonna be a real sucker.
I'm looking for evens.
You haven't any objections, have you, Sam? No, no.
Sure, I'll play with you, Nick.
And you can see my dough this time.
Oh, you're all right with me, Nick.
I suppose I always was, huh?
Now, listen, I got 50,000 bucks with me.
And I'll play you freeze out for the whole amount, pay after each hand.
That's a lot of dough.
Not for Nick.
That brother of mine owns the mint now.
And I'll give you a break.
I'll play at your best game.
I'll play you poker, stud or draw, Clobyosh, rummy, high or low pinochle, I'll even cut your high cards.
Name your weapons. Here, suntan.
Go downstairs and get a half a dozen new decks.
- Yeah... - Go on, stupid.
Anything the guest wants.
You're still superstitious, huh?
No, just careful.
Come on, Sam, get set.
We'll deal our own.
You boys get to the sidelines.
You don't mind if I take a peek of his play?
I don't care what you do.
I'm just playing Sam.
Count me in, Sam.
All right. Save your chips and we'll cash in later.
If you don't mind, let's see your dough.
I think I can match you, all right.
Well, I can't bet in to a one-card draw.
How much money have you got left?
Five C's.
Well, you better put them in the center, because that's just what I'm going to bet.
Well, I've got to call you.
All blue.
Well, they're good, and I'm clean.
I guess that's all. Hmm?
It is, as far as I'm concerned.
Sorry, Sleepy, tough luck.
Can't say that you got the breaks.
Gee, I wish those tailors would make these pockets a little bigger.
Well, Barnes, and you had to cut in on his share.
Heh-heh. Not so smart, huh?
Suntan, my hat, my cane, my gloves.
I heard that in a play once.
- Go with that as far as it'll take you.
Well, Nick the Barber gave you a trimming, huh?
Well, I'll be seeing you, boys.
- Wait a minute, Nick.
Behave.
How do you like it, boys?
What are you singing the blues about?
I told you I was gonna get evens, and I told you I was gonna play your way.
Of course, you smart gamblers have heard of shaved cards.
Well, Nick the Barber can shave them a little closer than you can.
Just take a look at those decks I sent out for.
Well, goodbye, boys.
And thanks for the buggy ride.
A weak knee you turned out to be.
- I had to take half of a dumb like that.
- Mug like that take you.
- Pipe down, you. You make me sick.
What kind of a mug are you?
Say, the smoke bother you?
- Oh, no, I like it.
- A little late to ask you, huh?
You know, a fellow in Havana makes them up for me.
Now, be yourself.
I suppose you're very happy this morning, Mr. Venizelos.
I read in the papers about you winning a lot of money from that gambler.
Um, Sleepy Sam, I think that was his name.
Yeah. Oh, that was nothing.
I'm just starting.
Before long, you'll be reading a whole lot about me.
My, it must be wonderful to win a lot of money like that.
Money don't mean anything to me.
Say, you're a pretty smart girl.
Maybe you can give me a little advice.
Now, if you were a man and a certain girl had made a sucker out of you...
...once upon a time, how would you get even with her?
- Well... - I don't mean hurt her or anything like that.
But just make her change her mind about me being a sucker.
Oh, why, you're only kidding, Mr. Venizelos.
How could anybody play you for a sucker?
No, no, no, I'm not kidding. I'm serious, sister.
I'd just like to get a little satisfaction out of that young lady.
Now, how would you go about it?
- Well, if I were a man... - Yeah?
The first thing I would do would be send her some flowers. - Mm-hm.
- Then I'd follow it up with a bracelet.
Then if she's that kind of a girl, well, the rest is easy.
Bracelet?
So you mean one of those things they wear around their wrists?
Yes, with diamonds in it.
You're not this girl's manager, are you?
Oh, here you are, Marie.
Take care of Blondie.
Just let me know anything I can do for you, sir.
I want you to open that door to that next room. And put these first two suitcases in there.
- Here, George.
But, boss, I can't spend no half a bill.
You'll get the other half at the other end of the line if you're a good boy.
Yes, sir. I won't be good, I'll be perfect.
Come here, give me luck.
Yes, sir. You sure have luck now.
Oh, George, what room is Mr. Short in?
- Mr. Short...
- Yeah, Hickory Short.
Oh, he's in 3-A, sir.
- All right, scram.
Marie, open the suitcase and hang up my checkered suit.
Well, boy, this is the payoff.
I wish the crowd back in the old barbershop could see us now.
Louisville bound with a bank roll big enough to choke a cow.
I guess after tonight, I'll send the boys back home a few thou.
You've already paid them double.
I got plenty.
Besides, ain't they still my pals? Heh-heh.
Neck to neck, Nick.
Make every post a winning one.
If I lose, I'll be back in the old barbershop matching pennies with Snake Eyes. - Heh-heh.
But how can I lose? Heh-heh.
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening, boss.
Here, try these.
A fellow in Havana makes them up for me.
- Oh, hello, Tom.
Say, can you let me have another key for a friend of mine?
Who for?
The district attorney?
No, chief of police.
Oh, in that case, you can have mine.
May I have your hat and coat?
I'll give it to you this time.
- How are they treating you?
- Say, you're new here, aren't you?
- Oh, you'll like it. Heh-heh.
- You know who I am?
- Straighten that painting.
Oh, Nick. Nick, look what I've won.
My luck finally changed.
- I just can't seem to lose.
- How much did you win?
- A hundred and 10 dollars.
Here, let me see.
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, 90, a hundred.
Great. Just what you owe me.
- What I owe you?
You never did have a good memory.
Why, Nick. What do you mean?
How are you doing now, baby?
I've been playing the red.
Here's a hundred, put that on the red too.
- You darling. - Ha-ha-ha.
All down? All down.
What are we gonna do about it?
Every time we raid Nick, he proves he doesn't own the place.
He's got a phony front for every one of his joints.
And you can't pin anything on him.
That isn't a suggestion.
That's an alibi.
We close him one night and he opens up the next in another spot.
Another alibi.
Now, I demand a showdown.
With election coming up I'm not going to let a tinhorn gambler put me in the middle.
We found Sleepy Sam, chief.
He got in from Frisco last week.
Boys, I'd like to see him alone.
- How are you, DA?
Just step into my office.
- Anything new on that case?
- Something hot.
- I'll talk to you later.
Glad to see you, Sam.
How have you been?
What's up, Black?
I just want to get some gambling information from you, Sam.
Well, three of a kind still beat two pair.
Don't be a comedian.
I don't know anything about it. I've been legit for months.
- What made you quit? - I got tired of it.
What's it to you?
Yes, you got tired of it after Nick the Barber pushed you over and rubbed it in.
I understand he took your girl too.
If you know so much, what did you send for me for?
Listen, Sam.
We're both holding the same bag.
This little greaseball, Nick, is giving us both the runaround.
Why don't you come clean? Tell me how to bring him down.
If I knew, I'd do it myself.
He must have some weakness.
He's just a smalltime hick at heart.
But just dumb enough to be smart.
If you were the district attorney, how would you tackle him?
I'd shoot him some night when he was trying to escape from the law.
That isn't done.
- Well, you know his weakness, don't you?
He's nuts for blonds. Yeah.
Send your wife around, he'll go for any old bag.
Why, you... Grr.
A little rub, Nick?
- Yeah, I don't mind.
Now, what is it you boys wanna know?
We want to know what you've got to say to this latest blast from the district attorney.
Oh, has he been talking about me?
Look at that. He's throwing kisses at you again.
Why, he's got me all wrong, boys.
I'm not a gambler, I'm a barber.
This is my shop.
This is the only business I've got.
Nick the Barber, isn't that what everybody calls me?
What's he wanna go ahead and make a lot of trouble for?
I'm just a nice little fella trying to get along.
What's he wanna go ahead and blow a lot of steam off for?
You know, he reminds me of a little sawmill we had in our old hometown in Irontown.
It had a big whistle, every time the whistle blew the sawmill stopped running.
Then you're going to keep your place open as usual?
Well, why not?
There's no law against running a barbershop, is there?
You're too smart for one guy, Nick.
- Yeah, I ought to incorporate, huh? Yeah.
Here, have a cigar, boys.
A fella in Havana makes them up for me.
- I'm not forgetting you, old boy.
- Well, so long.
See you in the jailhouse.
Sure, I'll come and visit you in the can anytime, brother.
Good luck, Nick.
I gotta catch this next edition, Nick. Thanks very much.
Well, pleasure was all mine, boys. Heh-heh.
Boss, you're sure one smart fellow.
- You sure tell them a big mouthful. - Yeah.
If that cheap district attorney get too fresh Nick the Barber give him close shave.
Now, don't be jealous, pal.
- How do you do?
- Are you Mr. Venizelos?
- Well, you've got the right fellow.
- I wonder, Mr. Venizelos, if you could...
- Oh, call me Nick.
- Well, I'm in an awful plight.
- Yeah? I've lost all my money at the roulette table.
And I wonder if you could lend me some to get home on.
I don't believe in lending, but I'll give you 10.
Ten? Oh, I need 500.
Where do you live, lady? China?
I could leave this for security.
Hmm. You can't go wrong on that.
- It's worth nearly a thousand.
- You know jewelry, all right.
And women too.
You know, it's my business to make a study of human nature.
And I can see that you're on the level.
I've heard how fascinating you are to women, Mr. Venizelos but the stories only half told it.
Well, I think that deserves a drink, don't you?
- How about it?
Here's to the most charming man I've ever met.
And here's to the most charming woman I've ever met.
- You're certainly a friend in need.
Big-hearted Nick, they call me.
Never said no to a woman in my life.
I'll take you to the cashier's and get the money.
Oh, don't let's forget this.
Tell me, when am I gonna see you again?
When would you like to?
Tomorrow for lunch, at the Savoy?
Yes, that would be splendid.
You give me your address, I'll send my car for you.
No, thanks.
Never mind, I'll just take a taxi.
Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't think of you doing that. Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, that's all right.
I'll meet you there, Nick.
And tell the district attorney I'll see him on Tuesday.
Say, get me the district attorney at his home right away.
- Hello, is that you, Black?
Well, this is Nick the Barber.
I just kicked your stool pigeon right out of my office.
If you don't quit messing around my affairs, I'm gonna kick you right out of town.
A stool pigeon?
What did she do to tip her mitt?
Oh, boy, I can tell them.
She had "district attorney" written right across her kisser.
Before I got through with her, she had Nick the Barber written across her something else.
You got wise to yourself at last.
No woman will ever make a sucker out of me again.
Nick is plenty smart these days. Yes, sir.
- Oh, boy. Ha-ha. - Heh-heh.
Boy, I'll never forgot the expression on that dame's pan when I gave her the boot.
Probably the first time she was kicked out of an office.
Stop, Bill.
- What's the matter? - We dragged a girl out.
- Will you take her?
- Go on, let's see.
Still alive? Yes.
Get a robe, quick. Yes, sir.
We'll take her to the hospital.
Wait a minute, what do you know about this dame?
Well, all I know she's almost drowned.
Come on. Quickly, get her in the car.
Get her in the car now.
- All right, George, pick up.
Attaboy.
- Go on, step on it.
How do you know she's not another plant from the DA's office?
I suppose they brought her here and threw her in the water.
Well, don't forget, you can still pour water.
Smart fella, aren't you?
- We're taking you to the hospital.
To the Receiving Hospital.
Now, don't get excited.
Oh, please don't take me to the hospital.
- Now, don't get yourself all worked up.
Let me out here and I'll go home.
I can get a bus.
No, you can't do that. You're all wet.
- You'll catch pneumonia. - I'll be all right.
Let her go if she wants to.
We might get into a jam.
You don't know what her racket is.
Bill, come on, pull up to the curb.
Say, I think you'd better take that robe with you.
It was kind of you.
Oh, Jack, Jack.
Come here, get her.
The act is on again.
It looks as though the kid is starved.
I suppose you call that fixing too.
- Put her in the car.
We'll take her home.
What do you think we're gonna do?
Come on, take care of her now.
Well, what are you gonna do about that girl?
Are you running a sanitarium?
Are you still harping on that?
Put on a new record.
Haven't you had enough trouble with dames without going out and looking for it?
I wouldn't trust any of them.
But you gotta admit, they're awfully nice company. Ahh...
Oh, why don't you snap out of it?
Say, your face is so long, I'd charge you two prices for a shave.
What, you up?
Probably got a date with her manager.
Yes, I'm leaving.
I just wanted to thank you for being so kind.
Oh, don't thank him, lady.
He loves playing St. Nick for dames.
He picks up a woman every week, just to keep in practice.
He's rehearsing a vaudeville act.
And if he lets out one more crack, I'll ring the curtain right down on his chin.
You can't walk out like this.
The doctor said you might get pneumonia.
Even the doctors play him for a sucker.
Say, why don't you wisen up?
- Snake Eyes.
- Draw another cup of java.
- Coming right up, boss.
I think you better stay put for a few days.
You look plenty weak.
Like The Wreck of the Hesperus?
I have a few questions I wanna ask this young lady.
- Do you know who we are?
Only you've been very kind.
- Have you ever heard of Nick the Barber? - Yes.
I've read about him in the papers.
He's a gambler, isn't?
Oh, I recognize you now. Heh-heh-heh.
And you've never seen him before?
Only pictures in the newspapers.
Well, lady, you must have some cream. Heh-heh.
Why did you jump off that bridge last night?
Are you sure you didn't fall off?
Say, what are you, a policeman or something?
Mother knows best.
Your friend doesn't like me very well.
Don't take what that loogan said seriously.
- Really, he's a swell fellow.
I'm used to abuse.
Hey, you'll be having Blondie crying in a minute. Heh-heh.
Come on, get hold of yourself.
- Were you working?
- I was, but I lost my job.
And then I got sick.
- Yeah, and you were broke, huh?
- I had a few dollars.
And some more things happened and... Heh.
Then last night.
I don't suppose it's very easy for you girls.
Oh-ho-ho, coward...
Say, lots of people would be cowards if they went through what you did.
But I'm all straightened out now.
- Attagirl.
- I feel like a new person.
- Thanks for what you did. - Oh-ho.
It's nothing, really. Heh-heh.
You'll need a little stake.
- It's awfully kind of you, but I can't...
- Oh, that's all right. Come on.
I'll probably never be able to pay it back.
Well, that's all right, sister.
I own the mint. My brother gave it to me.
And keep off of bridges.
- Here, what's the matter?
- Oh, I was just a little dizzy.
But I feel all right again.
You're not going out of here.
Not until you're better and get some color in those cheeks.
You're set on keeping that date with the undertakers, aren't you?
Nothing doing, you stay put.
You take orders from me, I'm taking orders from the doctor.
The doctor's coming up to see you sometime today.
And you're not going out till he says the word.
Now, be a good girl.
Oh, here's the key.
Well, I'm glad to see you get rid of that ghost.
That dame gave me the creeps.
Well, you'd make a great copper.
You can guess more right things wrong than anybody I know.
Well, where is she, then?
In the bedroom, wise guy.
Say, how long is this gonna last?
- What's the big idea, you going screwy?
- Why don't you button up?
I'm only doing what any decent guy in the same spot would do.
She'll be gone in a couple of days.
And then you can be my sweetheart again, dearie.
- I've good news for you, Snake Eyes.
This is the last time I'm gonna change the furniture around.
I done thought you was gonna wear this furniture out, kicking it around.
- Have a good sleep?
Well, so you've been at it again.
- Do you really like it?
- It looks swell.
What did you do with that picture of Jack Dempsey?
I put it in your den.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, that's all right.
Say, you can put Tunney in the cellar if you want to. Ha-ha-ha.
It's been so much fun fixing up a place like this.
Yeah, I like it better myself, since you've been around.
What's on your mind, baby?
Why have you been so nice to me?
Oh, well, that's my nature.
Big-hearted Nick, they used to call me back in Irontown.
You've done so much.
There doesn't seem to be anything I can do for you.
Why, you've done plenty.
Just being around is enough.
- I was thinking maybe... - Yeah?
No, you don't owe me anything.
Now, you stay here as long as you like.
And the longer you stay, the better I like it.
And someday, maybe...
Now, here, here, what's all this about?
Now, please, don't cry, baby.
There isn't a thing for you to worry about.
What's on your mind, honey?
I haven't been on the level with you, Nick.
- You're not from the DA's office?
But I haven't told you the whole truth about myself.
I haven't told you the whole truth about myself either.
Did you know I used to play the saxophone in the Irontown band? - Heh.
I'm serious, Nick.
- I'm wanted by the police.
- For blackmail.
- Blackmail?
- But it really wasn't blackmail.
I mean, I didn't intend to blackmail him at all.
I might get you into some trouble with the police.
Police don't bother me none.
As far as they're concerned, I'm just a barbershop proprietor.
They haven't got a thing on me.
- But don't you want me to get out now?
I'm not exactly a Sunday school teacher myself.
I seem to be kind of a jinx wherever I go.
Well, you haven't been a jinx to me.
I hate to do this.
But it's the only way we can nail him.
Of course, it's really compounding a felony.
And we've got to drive Nick out of this town.
The disgrace is we have to resort to such roundabout methods to get him.
But if we can put him in jail for only a few months we can break up his ring.
The public and the press will lay off me.
The girl is here.
I picked her up at the Savoy.
Miss Graham, come in.
How do you do, Miss Graham?
Miss Graham, I have here a warrant charging you with blackmail.
And enough evidence to convict you.
L... I didn't mean to blackmail him.
But what you did is extortion in the eyes of the law.
And you can be sent to the penitentiary.
But there's a way you can avoid going to the penitentiary, Miss Graham.
- A very simple way.
- What do you expect me to do?
Just a little favor.
While checking up on Nick the Barber, we found that you live in his apartment.
I live in a spare room down the hall.
Now, don't lie.
We watched every step both of you made for a week.
The sentence for blackmail, Miss Graham is two to 10 years in the penitentiary.
But you can avoid that if you'll just do what I ask you.
- Well, what is it?
I want you to get me those gold keys that Nick's customers use for his gambling...
- I haven't finished, Miss Graham.
- I don't care, I won't do it.
You can send me up.
Now, don't be foolish.
It's a case of you or him.
He'll never know you did it.
I won't. I won't!
All we wanna do is to give Nick a good scare.
He'll be out in a month.
That wouldn't hurt him at all.
While if you went to the penitentiary for a long sentence...
But he's the only the person that's ever been kind to me.
He's a public menace.
He's trying to corrupt public officials.
He's even put his filthy hands on policemen, state's attorneys.
- And even made overtures to our judges.
Please don't make me do it.
- Have you a key, sir?
You look swell, baby.
You got class.
I think you're about the prettiest little thing I've ever seen.
And the sweetest.
- I'm not what you think I am, Nick.
- What, not sweet?
Don't tell me, I know.
Nick used to be a sugar taster.
Doesn't that look nice there?
- I can't take it, Nick.
And what's more, before long, I'm gonna give you a ring.
For that finger.
- I'm all upset tonight, Nick.
Have you a key, sir?
No, we're with headquarters.
Go on, break in.
It's a raid.
Get rid of the gun.
Go get him. Get up.
It was you who let those coppers in.
You dirty little stool pigeon.
- Oh! What's this all about?
Lay off, Nick.
She's planting evidence on you.
She put it in the inside coat pocket. - I'm telling you, now look for yourself. - Hmm?
Why, it's nothing but a racing form, you smack-off.
Lay off, I'm telling you. Quit it.
I'm trying to steer you straight. Steer you straight.
- I'm gonna let you have it. - Yes.
Yeah, I'll show him, treating you like that.
Let's go downtown.
I'm just a guest here, like a hundred others.
I like your company.
You can't hang anything on me.
I don't own this place.
Look up the deed in the Recorder's Office.
- You don't, eh? - No.
All I own here is what I've got on.
We like your company.
It's hot and stuffy here.
You got good manners for cops. Heh-heh.
All right, I'll oblige you.
For all the good it's gonna do you. Heh-heh.
All you've got here is what you got on.
- Is that it, Nick?
Then you've got plenty.
That's nothing but a racing form.
You probably don't know there's an old blue law that classifies a racing form as gambling paraphernalia.
Makes possession of one punishable by a six-month jail sentence.
I didn't know it myself till just a few days ago.
But I know it now, Nick.
- Why, you dirty, you double-crosser...
Here.
- What's the matter with this fellow?
- I socked him.
And I'm darned sorry.
He didn't have it coming.
- Let's be going, Nick.
- This fellow isn't unconscious. He's dead.
Look out, here.
Jack, I'm talking to you.
It looks like manslaughter or murder now, Nick.
- So you gave me the works, huh?
But I didn't think it would be for anything like this.
I've always been a little coward.
Oh, Nick, could you ever forgive me?
That's all right, Irene.
I've always been a sucker for women.
Come on, Black. Let's go.
Hold it for a picture, Nick.
- Oh, sure, just a minute.
Yeah, Snake Eyes.
I brought Blondie along.
Thought you might like to say goodbye.
Hey, you sure I can't take her along with me?
No blonds where you're going, Nick.
Well, Blondie, no use two of us going up there, eh?
- Take this rabbit's foot, boss.
You gave me one of those once before.
I didn't mean no harm, because I loves you, Mr. Nick.
Here's the way to give me luck.
So long, Snake Eyes.
Come on over, Marie, the water's fine.
I suppose I should be glad you're going up, Nick after the way you've treated me.
I came down here to laugh in your face but I can't.
Oh, that's all right, Marie.
You're a swell guy.
I deserved what I got.
I'm sorry the way everything turned out between us.
I guess somebody must have been dealing from the bottom.
Well, here.
Buy yourself a box of candy.
You know I don't eat it. It gets in my teeth. Heh-heh-heh.
All aboard. - Yeah.
Come on, Nick, let's go.
- I'll be seeing you. Heh.
Hey, Nick, bye-bye.
I'll be seeing you.
Any final statement, Nick?
Tell my public I've put the close clippers on other fellas before this.
And now I'm gonna find out what it's like myself.
I wonder how I'll look with that monkey haircut they give you there. Hey, Nick.
How about a picture?
All right, just a minute.
I'll tell you when.
So long, Nick.
See you in 10 years.
I'll bet you 2-to-1 I'm out in five.
The story of Gramp's campaign for the battle of the wilderness.
Say, I know my history when you get into battles.
My Grandpa fought at the battle of the wilderness.
He says .. Say, that's history.
─ Well, he did.
That old, old fogy.
Don't you call me Grandpa an old fogy.
Just call him that again. Just try it. I dare you.
No, Donny. I didn't mean anything.
What do I care anyhow?
He fought at Bunker Hill, if you say so.
Not Bunker Hill. Bull Run
All those civil war battles.
Sure, Donny. Well, so long.
I'll see you tomorrow.
So long, shorty.
Chocolate cake!
What an eye.
Gee Mom, that's good.
─ Donny, stop that.
Oh Ma, can't I lick the spoon?
No. Run upstairs and get washed.
Your father will be here any minute.
Oh Ma, please.
I'm a growing boy and you don't know how hungry I get.
Alright .. there.
Thank you, mom.
Hey, don't I get any?
Sure Ned, but you're littler than I am so you don't get so much.
─ This much.
Gee, ain't that little.
Here is your father now.
Run upstairs and get washed. Quick, both of you.
Donny.
─ Oh, sweetie.
Go up and get washed this minute. Quick.
Quick.
Is Sue home yet?
─ Not yet, dear.
Well, she left the office long before I did.
Jim's over in his car.
─ She'll be along.
Sue can take care of herself.
She's doing alright now. Sitting out there with Jim Martin's arm around her.
You go right out and tell her to come in here.
Tell her supper's on the table, Jackie. We're ready to sit down right now.
I'm so hungry I could eat the legs off the table.
What you got, Ma?
Pork and beans!
That's the girl.
Jackie, go get your sister and bring her in.
Will I?
Hey, you two big names at the same big moment.
Can you tear yourselves apart long enough to eat?
You've lost something.
─ Your lips.
Better put them back on.
Hello, Donny .. well, Ned.
Hello Pop.
─ That's better.
Hi folks. ─ Hello, Sue. I thought you'd got lost.
No, Dad. We came home by Victory Drive.
Can I have some beans please?
I should think Jim Martin would be ashamed to drive that old can of his .. In behind those sixteen cylinder babies up on the drive.
Now, Jackie.
That old can as you call it, is a darn sight more car than you'll ever drive. If you don't quit wasting your time around pool rooms.
Start.
Gee, you're always hammering at me.
Is it my fault I can't find work?
I haven't seen you busting your legs trying.
My dear, I'm sure Jackie tries every day to find a job.
He should have stayed in high school.
Would I be making more money there?
No, but you'd learn something beside how to make cushion shots into a pocket.
Pass the beans, please.
I might be learning to be a bookkeeper.
Now that's too much.
Not only does this young loafer eat the bread of idleness .. He goes out of his way to belittle the one that provides it.
Now dear, I'm sure Jackie didn't mean it.
Oh, didn't he?
I'll have you know that your father is Chief Accountant, W.P. Randolph and Co.
And that's not a bookkeeper.
─ We all know that, father.
Don't mind.
Pass the potatoes, please.
I figure the cost on every bit of work done by the company.
Without me, they couldn't tell whether they were making money or losing it.
Some more beans, please.
They couldn't tell what prices are asked on anything.
I've got the right to go into any department. Any time. And ask any employee what he means by the figures he turns in.
Why, I've got authority from old Mr W.P. himself.
To go in there and question anybody, see. Anybody.
It's an important job, Jackie.
─ I got a man to help me.
A man?
You mean that pimply-faced kid that sits on the stool and watches the time clock? Pah!
Why, you impudent young cub.
Leave the room at once. Leave it!
My gosh.
─ Merciful heaven.
Never mind, Ma.
Now we are in for a pleasant evening.
It's Gramps.
Drunk again.
─ Now, father.
Private Summerill salutes the family of Leeds.
Come on, Grandpa. We've got big beans and spare ribs.
And chocolate cake.
And chocolate cake!
I'll warm a plate for you, father.
Oh don't mind that, Abi.
Good gracious, I'm eating vittles off a cold plate there at the soldiers' home.
Been having a little trouble with my legs.
Whenever it's going to rain my leg always bothers me.
Well, what did you come for?
I come to see my daughter.
Can't a fellow .. visit his own flesh and blood?
But I mean, how did you get away?
Got a forty-eight.
Forty-eight what?
A forty-eight hour furlough.
Good grief.
You mean, we got to put you up until Wednesday?
Well, you have to put me up or chuck me out on the street.
What a break.
Now I got to sleep two nights with this human foghorn.
You do me no favors pulling off the covers in the middle of the night.
Ah, nuts.
─ Jackie!
Now ain't that terrible?
Can you see the game with Donny in the middle of it?
That's just what I come for, Donny.
I'll be sitting behind that wire netting.
Watching that outfield of yours tearing across the plate.
Then you'd better quit drinking right now.
I'm not going to have this family disgraced again.
Like the last time when you blacked poor Mr Ashton's eye.
More beans, please.
Now there you go again, Abi.
You know that my leg's been bothering me and I just take them bitters.
A little overdose kinda limbers it up.
He ought to have called it a strike.
It was right over the plate. Not any higher than that.
And then there's another thing. He called me a billy-goat.
You came home with one eye closed and a policeman hanging on each arm. That's what you did.
Oh, policemen.
I just walked home with them boys.
I'd been wrestling with them, friendly like.
I'd have put them both on their backs, if it hadn't been for my legs.
It looked like friendly wrestling.
Why, you ought to be ashamed at your age.
Age?
Why doggone it, I'm just as strong as a bull.
And just as quick and nasty as a little kitten.
But dang you, George.
If you get my dander up, I'll put you on your back.
Now father, all ready.
─ Ah, you can lead me to it.
You got baked beans? Boiled potatoes. Spare ribs.
I don't care for spinach.
Just give me that. I'll have a helping of everything but spinach.
Spinach is good for you. It's got iron in it.
It makes you strong.
I'm strong enough.
Well, father.
How have you been?
Oh just fine, Abi.
But I tell you. It does a fellow good. To get back to his own folks.
To sit down with someone that cares whether he lives or dies.
Of course I ain't complaining.
Everything is mighty nice here at the home.
But after all. Blood is thicker than government pea-soup.
Well, we're glad to see you .. too, dad.
It's just a little unexpected. That's all.
Some butter, Grandfather?
─ How about some pickles?
Some more beans, Gramps?
No, I'm just getting along Jim Dandy.
I tell you, Abi.
They ain't got a cook like you there at the soldiers' home. Now, father.
Say, you got any more of that ..?
Oh, I'm sure .. ─ Blackberry jam?
That's it. That's it.
Blackberry jam? I'll get some from the cellar, Grandpa.
Get me some, too.
Some car backfiring.
It ain't no backfiring. It's two cars shooting at each other.
Sounds like the Battle of Chickamauga
Crashed.
Look, they're running.
─ The man in the yellow raincoat.
They've shot him.
And here they come.
Straight into our house.
It ain't locked. Somebody must have left it open.
Jackie, come over here.
Not upstairs, you sap.
We want to get out of here.
I ain't taking anything from you two fellows.
Hey, that's my Gramps!
Listen, you saps. You ain't seen nothing, see?
You ain't hard nothing, see?
One move out of you. And I'll smear your guts on your own wallpaper.
Now, how do you get out the back way?
Quick! Through the kitchen.
─ Through the back way.
Out the kitchen. What's the trouble here?
We may assume then, that these are the actual facts of the case.
A man known as Greener Kaufman. Was on his way into this office. In the company of one of my trusted officers.
A man known to us all.
Who never swerved a hair's breadth from the full performance of his duty.
A man we all loved.
─ Right, Chief.
There will never be another Jim Preston.
Kaufman then, was on his way here.
We were waiting to hear his story.
If he told all he knew, we could break the gangs in this city forever.
Do you know Mr Leeds, no gangsters have gone to the electric chair in this city?
Well. Lots of them should have been from what I read in the papers.
Now we think we know the man who did the shooting in front of your house.
We think we can send him to the chair.
Well .. well now, that's fine.
I hope you can, Mr Whitlock.
We think it was a man named Maxey Campo. Leader of one of the smaller gangs, it is true. But a rapidly growing power in the underworld.
We're with you, Mr Whitlock.
I thought you would be.
These then, are the facts in the case.
Our man Preston had been tailing Greener Kaufman, a rival gangster. Known to have a grievance against Maxey Campo.
Suddenly, out of a clear sky. The telephone rang.
It was Jim Preston.
He said that Greener had decided to come true and tell all he knew.
Jim insisted it was true.
He also said that a Campo gangster had seen him and Kaufman together.
I knew in a flash it was a matter of life and death.
I told Jim to grab a car and start Kaufman right in.
Then I hustled Police cars out from every direction. To try and pick Jim up before any of the Campo men could catch him.
Campo was as much taken by surprise as we were.
No time to send his hired gunmen.
It was a matter of minutes, seconds.
Greener Kaufman must never reach this office.
Campo ran for a car himself. Followed by his personal bodyguard. Dragging a machine gun.
Al Alan .. and Pinky Short.
We have witnesses who saw him get in the car.
These witnesses even described Campo's clothing.
A dark suit .. a gray hat.
That much we know.
Beyond that, we can prove nothing.
You see, the crash occurred so suddenly. Eyewitnesses could give us no clear idea of what followed.
A man in a yellow raincoat seemed to be the leader.
Now Campo could have slipped that coat on while he was in the car.
Whether he did or not, of course we don't know.
We saw the man in the yellow raincoat, didn't we, Ma.
Well doggone it, he stood right there on the running board, He knocked off the two fellahs that were running down the street like jackrabbits. Jumping for cover.
Oh, I seen him alright.
I've got a good eye.
And then he came into the house?
He came close enough so you'd recognize him if you saw him again, didn't he.
Close enough?
Why, doggone it.
I was just ready to grab him, when he tripped me.
And when I was trying to right myself, he popped me on the head with something.
Felt like a sledgehammer.
But I got a good look at him before he popped me.
Feel that bump.
If my leg hadn't been hurting me I reckon I'd have killed him.
You'd know that man again if you saw him, wouldn't you.
─ I would. I'd know him anyplace.
─ Couldn't fool me.
Some more beans, please.
The little fellow is sleeping. He's just wild about beans.
There ain't the shadow of a doubt, Mr Whitlock. That's the man that fired the shots and ran through our house.
Yep, that's him alright.
Are these all the witnesses?
And you were positive that was the man you saw? Yes, sir.
Alright, Mr Leeds. That's all, all of you.
I'll call you all in.
Can't be too soon for me.
Listen .. every man in this room.
I'm going to try and hang this on Maxey Campo.
You know what that means, don't you?
It means his pals will try to get me. They'll try and get every one of you.
I needn't tell you that, so stick with me.
You said it.
Boys, you all knew Jim Preston.
That smile of his.
It seems now, he's just out of the room somewhere.
But you and I, we saw him carried to his grave this morning,
And we saw Mary Preston. Those kids hanging on to her skirts.
Send out all the men you've got. Pick Campo up.
I think he'll come peaceably.
But if he doesn't, drag him in.
Drag him in.
"District Attorney Whitlock."
"Is to divulge the nature of the evidence."
"By which he expects to convict Campo of the murder of Preston and Clark."
Orville, if them two girls in the common room don't punch out soon. Better call up and see if they're working overtime. Okay.
Pardon me. Could you tell me where I could find Mr Leeds?
Why, I'm Mr Leeds.
─ Now, isn't that lucky.
I got here just in time.
I'm from the District Attorney's office, Mr Leeds.
He's got a complaint ready to sign.
But I'm not complaining about anything.
You are ready to testify against Campo aren't you?
Of course.
Ain't the slightest doubt it was Maxey Campo did the shooting.
Well, you see you've got to sign an affidavit to that effect. A complaint.
Step in the car, Mr Leeds.
I'll have you downtown and back home again in no time at all.
Maybe I'd better ..
Oh, we'll get there before you can call the number.
Alright, mister .. mister ..?
─ Horan.
Step in, Mr Leeds.
Donny. Come right in and get washed.
Your father is late for supper now.
Oh, Ma.
─ Right now.
Now you run along.
Your Ma wants you.
Did you win? Huh, Donny?
No, they licked us.
Oh. But they didn't beat us so bad, kid.
What was the score?
We got eight runs.
Oh boy, that's swell.
How many did the other team get?
Only eighteen.
Gee, that ain't many.
So we broke the door in with the woman screaming bloody murder all the time.
And there she was in the bathtub without a stitch on. Without a stitch.
─ Gee, Mr Horan.
We had to do it, Mr Leeds.
Yes, you never know what you're up against in this business, Mr Leeds.
I bet that's right, Mr Horan.
I tell you the general public don't realize what it owes to you fellows.
I'm certainly glad to hear you say that, Mr Leeds.
If there were more people like you, our job would be easier.
Oh boy, that's swell.
Soldiers.
Candy.
Beans.
Donny. Stop that.
Oh mom, ain't we never going to eat?
That's what I say, Ma.
Let's start.
Well, your father never likes that.
He'll be along soon.
Go and call your sister in, Jackie.
This ain't the Criminal Court building.
─ Why no. Didn't I tell you? Mr Whitlock is down here on another case.
He's got our papers with him.
Come on, Mr Leeds.
You will make it fast as you can, won't you Mr Horan?
It's past my suppertime now. ─ It will be fast alright.
What's this?
Where's Mr Whitlock?
Get over there.
This is him, Jack.
Give him a chair.
Is your name "Leeds"?
Well, where is Mr Whitlock?
A smoke, Mr Leeds?
You know, we brought you down here for a little talk.
Just a friendly talk.
Now you claim it was Maxey Campo that shot those 2 men in front of your house.
It was Campo alright.
─ But are you sure?
It's a serious business sending a man to the chair.
It was getting dark. You might have been mistaken.
As a matter of fact, you were mistaken.
Campo was over at his summer place at Tarris Hill.
You know, Mr Leeds. Campo ain't a bad fellow at all.
There's politicians in this town trying to hang something on him. That's all.
And we know you ain't the man to let them get away with it.
Now, are you sure it was Campo you saw?
I don't understand all this.
But it was Campo alright.
I might have been mistaken in the street. But when he came right into the house and stood as close to me as you are now.
I couldn't help seeing him.
Then, when they showed me his picture in the office. It was the same man alright.
You could forget it if you wanted to, couldn't you?
I've got to do my duty, sir.
Tell you what, Mr Leeds.
How would you like to take your family and go on a vacation?
Scenic California?
The sunshine .. the flowers. Avocados .. you know.
No, no. I couldn't do that.
They need me at the office.
Why Mr W.P. would never consent to that.
You see, I got quite an .. Important job. They wouldn't know where they were at.
Then what do you say to a thousand dollars?
And to stay right here in the city.
Look. A grand. Here it is in twenties.
I .. couldn't take that kind of money .. mister.
Mister ..?
And you guarantee to handle the rest of your family.
No .. no, I couldn't do it.
I've got to do my duty, sir.
And it's .. getting late.
My supper is ready ..
Please, please let me go home.
Sure, we'll let you go home.
After you learn your lesson.
We've got a little piece we want you to speak.
You may be some time learning it.
Especially, the gestures .. eh, boys?
What words?
Well, it goes like this.
I ain't seen nothing.
I don't know nothing.
Please no.
Pa not here?
Why, he left the office before I did.
Oh, father.
Hey, what you doing there, Abi?
Oh Mummy.
What's the matter, Abi? What?
What's the matter? ─ Pa.
He left the office long ago.
He should be home.
He'll be along soon, Ma.
Probably met some friends from the lodge.
Sue .. call Mr Whitlock's office.
Ma .. you suppose anything has happened?
No, no darling.
Everything will be .. alright.
Sure it will.
Why, nothing to get excited about. I can play pipe.
Got to know how to handle a pipe.
You can't kick a pipe around like a bass drum.
You're crying, Mumsey.
He'll be here any minute.
Mr Whitlock is coming right over.
Mr Whitlock?
─ He said to lock the doors. And let no-one in.
Merciful Lord.
Please, God. Don't let anything happen.
Please, God .. he's so good.
So good.
Please, God.
I told you to guard the family, Thorpe.
I know, Chief. I've had men watching the house back and front since the shooting.
Ask the man to give up his job? Throw the whole family in jail as they'd looked out the window at the wrong time?
Well, you could have given Leeds an escort.
Another for the girl?
Another to go to school with the boy?
Another to go round the corner with the old man for chewing tobacco?
The more we protect these people. The more certain Campo would be that they were all witnesses against him.
But we left them alone. Maybe he figured we were just taking a shot in the dark.
If we call out the militia he'd know for certain they'd all rapped against him.
Chief, believe me. I feel this worse than you do.
But I thought that we could get by until after the indictment was returned.
Then I planned on putting them all in a house of detention until after the trial.
But I didn't think that Campo or his men would work so fast.
Say, the mob would wipe the whole family out without a second's hesitation .. If they thought it would stop me from indicting Campo.
So that's what you've let us in for, is it?
You didn't tell us that up in your office .. oh no.
Up there it was "Mr Leeds" this and "Mr Leeds" that. "Have a cigar, Mr Leeds" and "won't you take this chair, Mrs Leeds". Until you hooked us.
And boy, I'm sorry.
We did what we could.
We can't take all the witnesses in every criminal case and lock them up, can we.
That don't bring my father home.
─ Don't worry.
We'll bring your father home alright.
They won't harm him.
Why should they? What good would it do them?
They'll only try to frighten him and send him back to handle the rest of you.
And when we get him back remember this.
It's war. We can't quit, any of us.
This is the fight of every decent man.
We're not only fighting Campo, we're fighting the whole rotten gang system.
They rallied to save him, to save their own hides for the future.
I'll protect you if I have to camp the whole Police Department on the doorstep.
I'll send Maxey Campo to the chair or die trying.
Maybe it won't be you that will do the dying.
Donny.
Donny.
Don't go to sleep first.
Please, Donny.
Alright, Ned.
I won't. Go to sleep, kid.
"Crisis expected tomorrow when District Attorney Whitlock .."
"Asks Grand Jury to indict Maxey Campo for first degree murder."
I wonder what we've done to deserve this.
I guess it's just life.
Well .. all set for another big day with these fan magazines.
Believe me, if I read much more about these babies out in Hollywood. I'll be putting my hair up in curl papers myself.
You don't have to read magazines, Jackie.
Seems to me your Dad had some pretty good books in that old case in there.
Say, this jail sentence is tough enough without making it any worse.
I tell you one thing.
I'm getting fed up on it.
It isn't the best break in the world, I admit. But .. you've got to grin and bear it.
What did we do? Why should we be penned up in here like a lot of crooks in jail?
You've a chance to do the city a service worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. If it could be paid for in money.
Yeah? Well, what do we get out of it? A bullet in the back and a piece in the paper?
Did you ever hear of the word "duty"?
And I heard of another .. "baloney".
You young whippersnapper, you.
You call yourself American, don't you?
This is your country, ain't it?
What about it?
A lot of skunks are running it. It ain't your country, it's theirs.
You're yellow if you live and let them run it. Oh, you and your old fogy ideas.
─ Fogy?
Supposing this fellow Maxey Compo took an idea to grab your sister.
Suppose he came in and hit your mother.
Would you let him get away with it?
Not if you've got one danged drop of my blood in your veins, you wouldn't. You white-livered puppy!
Ain't got a drop of them bitters left.
Hi, Mr Thorpe. ─ Hiya, Jim.
What's the news from the big world outside?
Is the civil war over yet?
We're still fighting it in here.
─ Is it that bad, Jack?
I brought you folk some magazines.
Thanks for your lovely gift, Jimmy.
It was just what I needed.
Why you kicking if there's nothing to do but read magazines?
Next time bring me some knitting needles or a mouth organ.
That old guy is driving me daffy with that pipe of his.
Hello, Miss Leeds.
Goodbye, Jackie.
Goodbye. ─ Goodbye.
Oh dear, I am so frightened.
Did you see anything, Ma?
Where is Mr Thorpe?
There, there. It's only Sue going to the store.
It's the Police car.
Did they go away and leave us all alone?
Now, it's alright.
Mr Thorpe is downstairs.
The other men are here, too.
Now, everything is alright.
I wish Sue didn't have to go.
Well the store has been awful nice, Pa.
Bringing your salary and hers too.
She said Mr Young needs her for the annual statement.
I reckon they need me, too.
Of course, Pa.
Then you'll be going back soon.
Ma, can I go to school?
─ No, you can't.
But Ma, today it the big return game with Danny O'Meara. And I got the best.
─ No Donny. It wouldn't be safe.
Oh, let him go, Mumsey.
I asked Mr Thorpe and he said I could.
He said he'd send a Policeman with me.
─ No, Donny.
I'm nervous enough about Sue.
There is some sense to that.
I don't want you gone, too.
─ Oh please, Ma.
There is no use whining.
You can't go.
Here. Take Pa's tray down.
Gee, I never can do nothing.
Do you want to play chess, Donny? Do you Donny?
Oh, alright.
Donny, why can't you be more careful?
Anything new, Thorpe?
Nothing here, Chief.
How's it shaping?
I'll indict tomorrow for 1st degree murder.
If they make a move to stop me, I'll ask the Governor to call out the militia.
I'll throw a guard around the Criminal Court building and panel a special jury. And I'll watch Maxey Campo die in the chair in 90 days from next Tuesday.
Bring in the witnesses. I want to check their testimony.
Well, Jackie's here. The old gentleman is in the other room.
Leeds isn't likely to go anywhere.
His wife is upstairs with him.
The two boys have been under foot here all day.
The girl's at work under guard.
She didn't see the shooting, anyway. Huh?
Not the actual shooting. Remember?
She was in the cellar and came up just as Maxey went through.
She identified him though.
─ Yes. She's useful for corroboration.
But the others saw him in the street and then the house, both.
Jackie, get your Granddaddy.
Oh, alright.
Yep? President Hoover wants to speak to you.
─ Hoover?
Hey, let me tell you about Hoover.
Tell it to Mr Whitlock.
Ned, what are you making such a mess for?
Donny sent me up here to find an old wrist strap.
He said it was in here so I got to ..
Find it.
Remember, you put everything back in that drawer before you leave the room.
Donny ..
Donny!
Oh, where is that boy?
We need a résumé of position. Time .. all the details.
Now go upstairs and get the same from Mr Leeds.
Right, Chief.
I can't find Donny.
Donny, where are you?
Donny's gone.
Why he was here just a few minutes ago.
Remember, Jackie? He had on his baseball suit.
─ Baseball suit?
I'll look outside right away, Chief.
Oh Donny?
Sure, he's here.
Oh, come to think of it. He sent the little boy upstairs to get something and he went into the woodshed.
Donny, Donny.
He probably climbed out the window.
But I've got to go. I've got to find Donny.
Please Ma, I'll go.
─ Neither one of you will go.
Mumsey, where is Donny?
He'll be back soon, darling.
The boy's disappeared.
We think he went to play with the school baseball team.
Get headquarters on the phone.
Order the Emergency Squad out. I'll find out where the ball game is.
Where is the ball game, Mrs Leeds?
The ball game .. why ..
It's at 21st and Hardy.
─ You stay right here.
Whitlock talking.
Yes. 21st and Hardy.
Do it immediate.
Get there in nothing, flat.
It's the Leeds boy, Donny.
The witness in the Campo case.
Pick him up and take him straight to headquarters.
Don't cry, Mumsey.
Donny's alright.
He can lick any kid on the block.
Everything will be alright, Mrs Leeds.
The Police will be there in two minutes.
I found these down at the end of the alley.
They were trampled in the mud.
It's a cap.
Well, it looks like there was a sort-of a struggle.
Oh my Donny.
This is Donny's alright.
That's the old glove he cut the thumb out of. So them fast rounders would stick better.
Run and answer it.
─ Wait. Where is the nearest telephone?
Why, it's the Ice and Coal stand at the corner.
Run, Williams. Trace that call.
This number is ..
Cambridge 9876.
If that's them, stall.
Stall, understand?
It might mean your brother's life.
There, is that any better?
This is Cambridge 9876.
I say, is this the Leeds home?
Yes. This is the Leeds home.
Hello, Central?
Central, trace that call on Cambridge 9876.
This is Williams of the District Attorney's office talking.
Yes .. yes.
Cambridge 9876.
I know, I know, but who's this talking?
Jack, you see they're stalling.
Tracing the call. ─ What? It's why they took so long to answer. They're getting another wire.
That dirty .. say, listen here.
Stop stalling and get this straight.
The boy is here, see.
And if any one of his family identifies Campo at the hearing tomorrow. That's the last you'll ever see of him.
What's that? What's that?
What is it, Jackie? What is it?
They got him, eh?
Do I have to go to bed, Mumsey?
I just want you with me.
They didn't get in on that wire.
I never heard no clicks.
We might let the kid out the back way to my place.
Ma ..
He's coming to.
We'd better take a chance here.
Too late, Chief.
It was somewhere on the Adams Exchange.
They hung up before we could get the number.
Where is the Adams Exchange?
─ Around 8th and Danton.
Well, that's where they had the father. Near the Ideal Paperbox Plant.
That's Campo's territory alright.
Get to the Telephone Building. Get a map of the Adam's Exchange district.
I'll call the Commissioner and tell him to meet you at Stanton Street station.
I'll throw every policeman I can in the area, and go through it house by house.
I'll find that kid if I have to move heaven and earth.
No. No I tell you.
I've gone through enough. I won't do it.
You identified Campo's picture in my office.
I won't testify.
Do you think I want Donny killed?
Please remember we have your sworn statement.
It won't do you any good.
I have say Mrs Leeds, we'll send you to jail if you don't.
Then send me.
We were ready to let your husband off on account of his condition. But if you go back on your sworn statement.
Why are you standing there and treating us like criminals?
Why don't you find Donny?
Mrs Leeds, 300 officers are searching a territory half a mile square. Going from door to door.
I'll tear every house in the district stone by stone if I have to, to get him.
Now, once more .. won't you tell the truth as you have sworn?
You can't trap me, Mr Whitlock.
Truth. I see you writing everything down.
Not a word.
No matter how you try to drag it out of me.
I won't I tell you. I won't.
Be still, Mrs Leeds.
Jackie .. do I look crazy?
I might hesitate to arrest your mother, but you tell the truth or in you go.
Well, you can pick me out a cell with a nice southern exposure right now.
The girl can't connect the man on the street with him that came in the house.
She couldn't prove a thing.
I know. There is only the old fellah left.
Yes. And he's not exactly what you'd call a good witness.
What's that? I heard that and I don't like it a danged bit.
I may be a little bit old, but let me tell you right here. I ain't never going to get too old to tell the truth.
I see that fellah shoot them two men in the street.
I see them run in this house.
I'm the one he lamped on the head.
I swore he was the same man you showed me the picture of in your office. And by golly he was.
I'll say it and I'll keep on saying it until the cows come home.
Father, think of Donny.
It ain't true, tell them it ain't true.
I am thinking of Donny and I'm thinking of something you folks all forget.
I'm thinking of what it means to be an American.
Yeah, well what do we get out of that?
What do we get out of it?
What do we get?
Well, jumping cornstalks!
Did our forefathers ask that when they were in their bare feet at Valley Forge?
Did we ask that when we were on the battlefields of Bull Run?
I'll tell you what I've got.
I got a musket ball in this here leg.
Sometimes when I look at you .. I wish we hadn't.
Now, what are you going to do about it? You whining whelp.
Father. Do you mean to say for any reason, and I don't care how you reason that. For any reason, you go through with your testimony.
With Donny's .. with Donny's life in danger?
We all live our lives are in danger. When gangsters can shoot folks down in the street and nothing is done about it.
But don't you love Donny?
─ That's it. That's just it.
Of course I love Donny.
But I don't want him to grow up in a country run by a foreign murderers.
We'll throw you out. We'll disown you.
We've got to put a stop to this here business, and I will tell the truth. Just as Donny would want me to.
We've got to make this country fit for boys like him to grow up in.
And who will believe you?
You were drinking that night.
You know you were.
You were drunk.
I didn't hardly expect that from you, Susie.
I don't care. I don't care. It's Donny's life.
Don't you understand? Were you drinking that night, Summerill?
Well, you see ..
─ Were you drinking?
Well, my leg had been bothering me, right smart. And I took a little nip of bitters.
And .. it's kinda stopped the hurt. Then I took another nip and it healed.
─ Were you drunk?
I was never drunk in my whole life.
Well, he's the best witness we've got.
I must build the whole case around him.
Put him on the stand first, and impeach the others by his testimony, huh?
But honestly Chief, I don't blame the family.
They're in a hot spot.
Hot spot, eh? Hot spot, yeah?
So am I in a hot spot.
So are we all.
Listen, all of you.
The case comes for preliminary hearing at two.
You'll be brought to the stand.
I shall read to the court your separate statements in your presence.
What you do then, will be your lookout.
─ All of them?
Mr Leeds, too?
I said all of them.
Put him in an ambulance.
Bring the little boy, too.
Place a special guard to watch old Summerill. He's not exactly what I'd call a star witness, but he's the best we've got.
We can't afford to let him out of our sight, even for a second.
Get going.
Take both sides of the street.
Go as far as Grand Boulevard.
Remember now, ring every bell.
Work fast.
Now boys, we've got to make a thorough search.
A hundred dollars reward to any one of you who can find the Leeds boy.
Lieutenant, the company will do everything in its power to help you.
Get going boys, and keep a sharp lookout.
Call Summerill to the stand first, then Jackie, and then the girl.
That should be enough to hold Campo for the Grand Jury.
I'll try to keep Leeds and his wife off the stand if I can. And the young boy is too small.
I'm afraid of Jackie.
Afraid? I'm afraid of all of them.
The doddering old fool that was drunk. And the others too weak-kneed to say that black is black.
But don't you think Chief that we might postpone ..
Postpone.
What for? You think for a minute, no matter what we do, those rats will turn the boy loose?
You think they'll let him go so he can go to the rogues gallery and pick them out?
Do you expect Lulus like that to keep any bargain they make?
Well, with a little time.
─ Time, you say?
I say that every minute that we stall puts us that much deeper in the hole.
We've got one chance and only one, and that's to strike.
Campo is in the can.
Campo killed Preston and Campo has got to die.
But the boy?
─ How do you think I feel about that?
We're doing all we can for the boy.
If he's where we think he is, we'll find him.
If human aid can save him we'll save him.
But it won't be by any bargain with a bunch like that.
Why, they'd cut his throat the minute we turned Campo loose. And dump him in our door yard and laugh at us for being suckers.
Man, face facts.
Mr Whitlock .. the old gentleman.
─ Who, Grandpa?
Yes, sir. From the gents washroom.
─ What happened?
Well .. he asked me to take him to the washroom so I took him.
And I shut the door after us.
And when I turned around there he was standing holding a .. spit .. A cuspidor over his head.
I said, here, I said. What the ..
And before I could even duck .. Everything went dark.
Why I thought a building had fell down on me. And when I came to, I found myself lying in the corner. With a cuspidor growing out of my ear.
And no old man.
That's fine. That makes your record one hundred percent rotten.
First the boy, now the old man.
─ Yeah, but I thought. ─ Shut up.
Yes, sir.
Our star witness.
Our fearless old lion of Bull Run ran out on us.
You search the building?
All over, Mr Thorpe and I can't find him anyplace.
Notify the Police.
Drag the old fool back if they can find him.
We'll put Jackie Leeds on the stand first.
I'll make him come through if I have to use thumbscrews to do it.
What are you doing down in there?
Fixing a conduit.
─ Huh?
Fixing a conduit.
How long you been down there?
─ Oh, a couple of hours.
How in the devil did you go about getting down there?
Fell in.
Smart Alec.
I don't reckon anybody as dumb as he is will know ..
Can you tell me where the Adams Exchange is?
Sure. Lincoln Avenue near Curtis Boulevard.
From 4th Street to about 12th.
Oh, just getting to know my way around.
A stranger in the city, huh?
─ No, I ain't! I only got here about 75 years before you got down in there.
How old are you, dad?
─ Ha?
─ How old are you?
Well, I've got the greatest body that's older than anybody.
I'm old enough to stay out of holes.
Didn't you identify his photograph in my office?
You saw the man in the yellow raincoat in the street.
Well, it was getting kind of late.
─ Then he came in to your house.
He stood within a few feet of you.
Well, his back was turned. And the collar of his raincoat ..
Quit making excuses!
Think well now, before you answer.
Remember, I have your sworn statement in my hand.
Could you identify that man f you saw him now? As he was dressed that night?
Come here, Campo.
Slip that on, will you.
Put that on, too.
Is that the man you saw that night?
Is that the man who killed who men in front of your eyes? And then ran past you as close as he is now?
Is that the man?
Your Honor, I ask for an order remanding the witness on a charge of perjury.
I can do so.
Is that all for me, Mr Whitlock?
I haven't started with you, Campo.
Take your time, Mr Whitlock.
Take plenty of time.
Suckers.
Watch it, Pappy. The horses will cut you down if you try that often.
If they want to cut me down they'll have to go some.
Here boys. Look around.
How many flats upstairs?
─ Twelve.
Know the people in them? No.
I'm a stranger here. I've only been here a couple of weeks.
There's a Speakeasy in the back Lieutenant.
We don't need no riot squad to find them. Get upstairs.
Did you see a boy who looked like he might be held against his will?
Sounds like a dime novel.
No. I didn't.
Turn off that music.
One squawk out of you and I'll break your neck.
Lay low, boys.
Don't leave any milk until Thursday.
Say, there's nothing in the manual about busting in people's doors.
Give me a hand, fellahs.
She's out.
Nobody home here.
Is that the man that did the shooting?
I didn't see the shooting.
I was in the cellar when it happened.
Was that the man who came into your house after the shooting? Carrying a revolver in his hand.
It looked like the man.
─ What do you mean by that?
It is the man or it isn't.
If it looks like the man, it is the man.
Well, he's dressed like the man.
He's the same size.
At a quick glance, he looked like the same man.
Why a quick glance?
Why didn't you take a good long look?
I did take a good look. Just now, Mr Whitlock.
But I didn't the night of the shooting.
Remember, I was still in the hallway wheñ I saw him.
I came up out of the cellar with a glass of jam in my hand. And there he was in the dining room. Flourishing his revolver.
Naturally I stopped.
He turned his face to me for a moment.
─ He turned his face for a moment.
And with that short look, would you say that's the same man?
He looks like the same man.
He is the same man .. will you say it?
He looks like the same man.
Alright Miss Leeds. That's all.
The street is crawling with the lice.
There goes another one, up Lincoln Avenue.
All we go to do is lay low.
Those mugs couldn't find their own nose if it was running.
Now you bring it over the end of your finger like this. Then kind-of whip it when you let it go. That's a change-up
Gee mister, that's a new one on me.
Say, what is this, a Sunday school meeting?
Alright Jack, alright. Lay off.
This ain't going to make it any easier.
Later on. Get me?
It's keeping him quiet, ain't it?
Alright, but keep him away from them windows. That's all.
Do I look screwy?
[ German language ]
[ German language ]
A French woman, huh.
When I was with Evansville in the Three-I league. I used that sidearm almost all the time.
Gee mister, were you in the Three-I league?
You mean, you're a real ball player?
Well. I've been throwing them highballs too much to be much good now.
What's your name, mister?
Just call me Mickey.
We'll get along alright.
Alright ..
Mickey.
But tell me some more about that ball drop.
Could you control it?
Hey Grandpa, you can't do that.
What are you doing away from home?
─ I got a furlough.
Well, uniform or not. You can't do any begging on my beat.
Come on now. Move on there, dad. Come on.
Don't be shoving me. ─ Go on now.
Go along with you.
You hold your hand like this. And then you bring the ball up underneath like that. And let it roll off your thumb.
You mean like this, Mickey?
You'll have to eat some barrels of flour so your hands are big enough to do that.
Ah, go on.
Gramps!
I said I cramped it.
A tough one, ain't it.
─ Ah no, it ain't tough.
You let it go underneath.
─ Now you're getting it, kid.
What did I tell you, you sap.
Oh look, up there!
Little louse.
Now see here, Grandpa.
I don't care whose Grandpa you are.
You can't raise a ruckus here.
Get him out of here.
Summerill.
That missing witness in the Campo case.
Just listen here.
Donny. Donny's up there in that window.
He threw out his baseball so I'd know where he was.
Look at his initials. Donny Leeds.
The boy who has been kidnapped.
You can't go up there, Gramps.
They've got that boy there, ain't they?
Where'd they get you?
Bring a stretcher.
No stretcher. It's my leg.
It's buckled under me. Give it a yank.
Pull it like you meant it.
Fit as a fiddle.
Let me up.
I needn't tell you the law, Mr Whitlock.
You have produced no evidence to warrant me holding this defendant.
Your Honor, may I ask your indulgence for a matter of great importance in the case?
─ Your Honor, I object.
Alright, bring them right in.
Mrs Leeds, your boy is safe.
─ Donny?
Thank the Lord.
They're bringing him here as fast as they can.
I hope he gets here safe and sound.
What's he done, Mumsey? What's he done?
Is he coming home?
Your Honor. Some additional witnesses are on their way here to testify.
Hey.
One more, Mr Summerill.
Order in the court.
Will you take the stand now Mr Summerill or perhaps you'd rather wait?
Maybe you are tired?
Maybe you'd like a drink of water.
That's him alright.
That's the fellah did the shooting.
And you skunks ain't so tough as you think you are.
The trouble with us, we're too weak-kneed with them.
What would the founders of our country done with scum like them?
What would Abraham Lincoln have done?
He'd of rose up and dragged them into the ocean.
It's time we was doing the same thing. Because I tell you a danged, dirty foreigner .. Can crowd an American just so far.
Just so far.
So you don't believe it, eh?
You will lamp me on the head, will you?
Now, where is that witness stand?
Make it snappy, Gramps.
We've got beans for supper.

TABU A story of the south seas
Only native-born south sea islanders... appear in this picture with a few half-castes and chinese.
First chapter PARADISE
A LAND OF ENCHANTMENT REMORE IN THE SOUTH SEAS... THE ISLAND OF BORA-BORA STILL UNTOUCHED BY THE HAND OF CIVILIZATION.
GREETING FROM THE CHIEF OF FANUMA LORD OF ALL THE ISLANDS TO THE CHIEF OF BORA BORA
UPON YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE I CONFER THE HIGHEST HONOR KNOWN TO OUR ISLANDS
THE MAIDEN SACRED TO OUR GODS HAS PASSED AWAY AND I DECREE THAT FROM YOUR ISLAND SHALL COME HER SUCCESSOR
ONE I HAVE CHOSEN FOR HER BEAUTY, FOR HER VIRTUE, FOR HER ROYAL BLOOD, SHE WHO IS NAMED RERI
NO LAW OF THE GODS IS MORE TO BE FEARED THAN THAT WHICH GUARDS THE CHOSEN ONE MAN MUST NOT TOUCH HER...
OR CAST UPON HER THE EYE OF DESIRE FOR IN HER HONOR RESTS THE HONOR OF ALL HER PEOPLE
SACRED IS RERI FROM THIS TIME FORTH SHE IS TABU TO BREAK THIS TABU MEANS DEATH
HITU: WORTHIEST OF MY SUBJECTS BEARS THIS MESSAGE AND WILL BRING THE MAID TO ME...
FOR HER SAFETY HE WILL ANSWER WUTH HIS LIFE
7 p.m. The whole Island is still in an uproar.
The girl Reri has been stolen.
Whatever has happened, according to their law she is still the "Chosen one"...
Unless she is returned the Tabu means death...
She will be hunted down and sacrificed, Matahari will be killed old Hitu himself will die.
I shall not leave until I learn what the island is going to do.
NO LAW OF THE GODS IS MORE TO BE FEARED THAN THAT WHICH GUARDS THE CHOSEN MAID MAN MUST NOT TOUCH HER...
OR CAST UPON HER THE EYE OF DESIRE TO BREAK THIS TABU MEANS DEATH
Second chapter PARADISE LOST
IN THEIR FRAIL CANOE THROUGH STORMS UNDER A BURNING SKY THIRST-CRAZED AND STARVING... ALWAYS DRIVEN ON BY FEAR... FEAR OF THE AVENGING TABU.
The couple found in their wrecked canoe, as already reported, recovered quickly.
The boy, it develops, is born diver, the best we have ever had on the island.
But it seems only play to him.
He evidently does not yet realize what money means.
But the girl was stolen before the ship left Bora-Bora
As the Government desires above all things to avoid conflict between the islands under its rule,... it demands the arrest of this man and woman wherever found.
For their arrest, the Government ofers a reward of Five Hundred Frans.
Et. Cadoustal .
There is a spot in the lagoon, the richest in pearl beds of any in the South Seas.
But this spot is Tabu.
Natives shun it.
Today, one of our old divers defying the superstition.
An enormous man-eating shark guards these pearls the native believe...
Today's tragedy proves this is no superstition: the shark is there.
I trust I have the Government's approval in putting up a sign forbidding further diving in this place.

TO MATAHI MY LOVE
I HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY WITH YOU FAR MORE THAN I DESERVED THE LOVE YOU HAVE GIVEN ME I WILL KEEP TO THE LAST BEAT OF MY HEART
ACROSS THE GREAT WATTERS I WILL COME TO YOU IN YOUR DREAMS WHEN THE MOON SPREADS ITS PATH ON THE SEA FAREWELL
- What is it, Poole?
- It's 2:45, sir... and your address at the University is at 3:00.
So it is, Poole.
- You know, Poole? You're a nuisance.
But I don't know what I should do without you.
Your sense of duty is as impregnable as Gibraltar.
- Even Bach can't move it.
I'm afraid you'll be late, sir.
I see you want to get rid of me.
All right, Poole.
They're lovely roses, Poole.
- Will you wear your overcoat or cape, sir?
- Give me my cape.
- Good afternoon, Jasper.
- Nice day, isn't it?
- Isn't it, sir?
- St. Simon's.
Constable.
I won't need you anymore today, Jasper.
Dr. Lanyon will take me where I'm going later.
- How do you do, Dr. Jekyll?
The auditorium's full, sir.
It always is when you speak, sir.
Flattery!
- I hope Jekyll's in form today.
- He's always in form.
The old codgers are in for another jolt.
I'd wager your friend has something up his sleeve again, Dr. Lanyon.
Jekyll is always sensational, always indulging in spectacular theories.
Gentlemen...
London is so full of fog... that it has penetrated our minds... set boundaries for our vision.
As men of science, we should be curious... and bold enough to peer beyond it... into the many wonders it conceals.
I shall not dwell today on the secrets of the human body... in sickness and in health.
Today, I want to talk to you of a greater marvel:
The soul of man.
My analysis of this soul, the human psyche... leads me to believe that man is not truly one... but truly two.
One of him strives for the nobilities of life.
This we call his good self.
The other seeks an expression of impulses... that bind him to some dim animal relation with the earth.
This, we may call the bad.
These two carry out an eternal struggle in the nature of man... yet they are chained together.
And that chain spells repression to the evil.
Remorse to the good.
Now, if these two selves could be separated from each other... how much freer the good in us would be.
What heights it might scale.
And the so-called evil, once liberated... would fulfill itself and trouble us no more.
I believe the day is not far off... when this separation will be possible.
In my experiments, I have found... that certain chemicals have the power...
Tell me, he can split me in two like a jolly amoeba.
- By Jove, it's marvelous.
- I confess it's too much for me.
Why don't you stay at home and send your other self to the lecture?
To divide a human being in two?
I'm going to try to analyze my psyche.
- I didn't expect you to agree with me.
- Agree with you?
You talk like a lunatic.
But I hope you're sane enough to remember... that we have a consultation at the Duchess of Densmore's.
Please give the duchess my compliments and some castor oil.
She's a bit bilious, more in spirit than in body, I'm afraid.
- I'm going along the free wards.
- My dear fellow, be reasonable.
You know how insistent the duchess was on your coming.
You can't neglect her for a lot of charity cases.
It's the things one can't do that always tempt me.
Just as you like.
But you'll remember we're having dinner at the Carews' tonight.
- I'll pick you up later. - Thanks.
You'll find me in the wards.
Mary, what are you doing with those crutches?
I can't do without them, sir.
Yes, you can do without them, Mary.
Believe me, I can't do anything for you.
I believe you, sir... but I can't walk without them, sir.
Now walk, Mary. Come on.
Walk, Mary.
All right, sir.
I can walk, sir.
- I can walk, sir!
There, there, Mrs. Lucas.
- It hurts, doesn't it?
Sometimes a doctor must hurt you a little to make you well.
And if a doctor thinks a slight operation is necessary... there's no need to be afraid, is there?
- I want you to know it's going to cure you.
Jekyll, we haven't much time, you know.
I'm afraid I must miss the dinner.
I'll come afterwards for the dancing.
- What's keeping you?
- I must operate on this patient at once.
Why not leave it to one of the house surgeons?
They're quite competent.
Perhaps, but I prefer to do it myself.
Will you make my excuses to General Carew and Muriel, please?
Lanyon, you make my excuses to the General... and I'll make mine to Muriel myself.
Yes, Miss Muriel.
Will it be almond cakes with coffee, Hobson?
- I'm sorry, miss. I don't think so.
- But we must have almond cakes.
- Send for them immediately. - Very good, miss.
- What's this about almond cakes?
- Dr. Jekyll likes them, Father.
You know you'll spoil that fiancé of yours.
- I like spoiling him.
- So I observe.
You're already the most spoiled darling in the world.
Dr. Lanyon.
Lanyon.
Punctual for dinner, punctual in everything.
How do you do, sir?
- What an astonishing motto.
- Where's Jekyll?
- He stayed to perform an operation.
- Isn't he coming?
- He will be in after dinner.
He asked me to make his excuses.
I hope the patient is worthy of Jekyll's attention.
- A woman in the free wards.
- Free ward.
Jekyll gives entirely too much time to his charity patients.
I love him for that.
Nonsense, my dear.
He ought to come down to earth.
- Mr. Utterson. - Utterson.
However, I promised Harry the first waltz.
If he's late, I shall be furious with him.
You know, I'm very glad Jekyll is late.
I'm obliged to him for a most delightful waltz.
Hello, General.
I'm very sorry to be late, sir.
Repentance is a virtue, Jekyll, but it's better to be punctual.
In 40 years, I've never been late for dinner.
It's indeed a remarkable record, sir.
Merely a matter of training, my boy.
At the age of...
General, you've not forgotten this is our dance?
Certainly not, Lady Dakin.
I've been looking forward to it.
See you later, Jekyll.
- But you will.
- Ravishing.
Someone to make you late again?
- Are you chiding me?
- Because you hate me?
- Of course, silly.
Then, will you come into the garden where I can bear it?
- Father. He'd be furious.
- It would do him good.
He's teaching Lady Dakin how to waltz.
- Can't stay long.
- Just forever.
Not even half as long as that.
Now, my farthing, chide me, mock me, hate me... but don't send me away.
Silly.
Are you sorry you were late?
- If I wasn't late, you wouldn't have pouted.
- I won't forgive...
If you hadn't pouted, you wouldn't have looked so pretty.
Do you talk this way to your patients?
If you hadn't looked so pretty, I might have postponed...
I might have postponed telling you that I love you so much... and I don't want to wait any longer.
I want you to marry me now.
Darling, I want to with all my heart. You know I do.
But Father's so difficult.
I don't want to marry your father.
I don't mind having a difficult father-in-law.
You'll be worth it, my darling.
I don't think you love me seriously.
I love you better than that.
I love you gaily, happily, high-heartedly.
I love you so much that I could laugh and sing and...
I shouldn't spoil it by trying to sing.
My darling, I shall persuade your father to let us marry now.
We shall go to Devon for our honeymoon and live on love and strawberries... and the sight of the sea.
- And moonlight.
- Endless moonlight.
I do love you seriously.
So seriously that it frightens me.
You've opened a gate for me into another world.
Before that, my work was everything.
I was drawn to the mysteries of science, to the unknown.
But now, the unknown wears your face... looks back at me with your eyes.
Darling, I wish this moment would last forever.
You can make it last, dear.
Be near me always.
Always you and I.
Apart from the world.
Then who shall ever separate us?
- My sweet friend.
You ought to wear squeaky shoes, Hobson.
The General asks you to come into the house, miss.
- Your guests are inquiring about you.
- Coming, Hobson.
- Glad you came.
- Good night, Muriel.
- You looked perfectly lovely tonight.
- Good-bye, my dear.
- Good night, General.
I don't know when I've enjoyed myself so much.
- I'll see you at tea tomorrow, dear.
- Yes. I won't forget, Lady Dakin.
Jekyll, my boy.
Waiting to see me?
I beg your pardon, sir, but you would make us very happy... if you'd set an earlier date for our wedding.
I've already announced to you... that you would be married on the anniversary of my own wedding.
- That's eight months from now, sir.
- What of it?
We've already been engaged two months, sir.
We see no reason to...
I presume I have some rights in the matter.
That's why we're asking you.
- Why this impatience?
It isn't done.
I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot regard that as a serious objection.
Do you hear this, Lanyon?
Is this another evidence of your eccentricity?
If it is eccentric to be impatient in love, sir, I am.
This is positively indecent.
Father, do you think it fair to keep us apart for so long?
- I waited five years for your mother.
- You have a sturdy temperament, General.
Yes, I pride myself on it.
Please don't make me wait that long for Muriel.
Now, my boy, you must leave these matters to me.
There's such a thing as decent observance, you know.
- Good night, Lanyon.
Au revoir, my sweet.
Come, Lanyon.
- I'm afraid you offended the General.
- Offended him?
It's a pity I didn't strangle the old walrus.
Did you hear him? "Wait!"
What the devil does one wait for?
I hope the responsibilities of marriage will sober you up.
I'm not marrying to be sober. I'm marrying to be drunk.
- Drunk with love and life and experiments.
- Your experiments are absurd.
You have no interest in science at all.
You have no dreams, no curiosities.
There are bounds beyond which one should not go.
It isn't done, I suppose.
I tell you, there are no bounds, Lanyon.
Look at that gas lamp.
But for some man's curiosity, we shouldn't have had it.
London would still be lighted by linkboys.
And wait. One day, London will glow with incandescence... and will be so beautiful that even you will be moved by it.
I find London quite satisfactory as it is... and I'm not interested in your shortcuts and your byways.
But it's in the byways that the secrets and wonders lie:
In science and in life.
Look at the...
Fine, you big brute, hit me!
I'll put the police on you!
Are you badly hurt?
Where does this girl live?
First door on the left at the top of the stairs.
Bring her up here.
Make way for the governor.
Have you got her, governor?
- Right up here?
- Yes. Look out for her head.
Shut up, you lot!
What was this all about?
- One of Ivy Pearson's callers...
- I can tell you...
Now shut up!
One of Ivy...
That swine.
Hit me, will he?
He'll wish he hadn't!
I ain't afraid of him, I ain't. Blast his dirty mug!
He's killed me, that's what he's done.
He's broken me jaw and me knee, too.
I'll get him for this!
Look where he kicked me.
It's only a bruise.
It will be quite well in a few days.
Either way, you mustn't wear so tight a garter.
It's bad for you.
It impedes the circulation.
It's awful kind of you to look after me.
Anybody can see now that you're a real gent, you are.
Now you're the kind a woman would do something for.
- He's hit me here, too, the blighter.
He's broken me rib. That's what he's done.
A bit of rest would do you no harm, though.
You think I ought to go to bed?
I know of no better place for a rest.
You turn your eyes away now.
How is the pain now?
I say!
I'm a doctor, you know, and I'll call that kiss my fee.
Come back soon, won't you?
- Sorry. I'm afraid I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
Soon, come back...
- I thought your conduct quite disgusting.
- Conduct?
Why, a pretty girl kissed me.
Should I have called the constable?
- Even suppose I'd liked it.
Yes. That's not a matter of conduct, but of elementary instinct.
You ought to control those instincts.
Are you pretending that you either can or do?
We may control our actions, but not our impulses.
Perhaps you've forgotten you're engaged to Muriel.
Forgotten it?
Can a man dying of thirst forget water?
Did you know what would happen to that thirst if it were denied water?
If I understand you correctly, you sound almost indecent.
What names you give things.
Why aren't you frank enough to admit that other indecent self in you?
You prefer to hide it, pretend it isn't there.
- You have to accept certain things.
- I don't want to accept.
I want to be clean, not only in my conduct, but in my innermost thoughts and desires.
- There's only one way to do it. - How?
- Separate the two natures in us.
- That absurd theory of yours.
I tell you, it's unscientific not to admit the possibility of anything.
Mad, Lanyon?
What is it, Poole?
Begging your pardon for the intrusion, sir, but did you sleep last night, sir?
Yes, sir, but you had only a cup of tea for breakfast for three days.
Your health!
Now, Poole, you didn't come here to inquire after my health, did you?
One of General Carew's servants brought this, sir.
Miss Muriel is scolding me for having missed her dinner last night.
Go and tell her that I shall come to dinner tomorrow night.
Marry me now.
Positively indecent.
Look where he kicked me.
Your conduct was disgusting.
It isn't done!
Pity I didn't strangle him. Strangle him!
Indecent!
Mad, Lanyon?
You hypocrites, deniers of life.
If you could see me now... what would you think?
- Who is there?
Dr. Jekyll, sir.
Do you hear me, sir?
Please let me in, sir!
I thought I heard a strange voice.
There was someone here.
His name is Hyde.
He's just gone out the back door.
Marry me now, my darling.
You don't know how much I need you.
I want to with all my heart, but Father...
I'll try to change his mind while we're away.
- Away? - Yes.
Darling, I've dreaded telling you... but Father's taking me to Bath tomorrow.
He has no right to take you away from me.
Why must we put up with this?
- You want to marry me?
We'll marry without his consent.
Say you will, my darling.
We'll go to Paris for our honeymoon.
We'll be so gloriously happy... that even the French will be jealous of us.
I'm so thrilled and tempted, but I don't want to hurt my father.
It's only a little hurt to his vanity.
You'll do me a greater hurt if you refuse.
Do be patient, just a little while.
I'm sure I can persuade him while we're gone.
- Darling, don't you love me enough... to wait a little while?
Of course I love you enough, dear.
And wait.
A letter from Bath, sir.
Miss Muriel won't be home for another month.
- Can't even go to see her.
- I'm sorry to hear it, sir.
- Another month.
- I beg your pardon, sir... but may I suggest that you ought to amuse yourself.
Amuse myself?
What do you suggest, Poole?
You ought to go out, sir.
London offers many amusements for a gentleman like you, sir.
Yes, but a gentleman like me daren't take advantage of them.
Gentlemen like me must be very careful of what they do and say.
What are you after down there?
I was calling on the young lady who occupies the little nest.
If it's Ivy Pearson you mean, she ain't in.
If I was wanting her, I'd try the Variety Music Hall.
You get out!
What do you take me for? Get out!
- Stay out!
Bottle of champagne and be quick about it.
What are you waiting for?
A tip? Get out!
Blighter.
- You swine!
He's a rum one.
You're a bit of something to look at and listen to, dearie.
Not half bad, so they say.
- You ain't conceited, are you?
- I has me points.
- Blimey, there's Irv.
Tell that wenching brat to come over and have a bottle of wine with me.
The gent there wants you to have wine with him.
Come if you know what's good for you.
He ain't one to be trifled with.
Strike me pink.
- I'll take you to him.
This is indeed a great honor.
I noticed you as you came in, my dear.
"There," I said to myself...
"is too pretty a girl to waste on such a companion."
But you are pretty.
And what a figure, my dear.
To you, my dear.
To your beauty.
- I must be going now.
- Going.
- You call that home?
- That pigsty of yours in Diadem Court.
- Sty, is it?
You come off that.
I like you when your temper's up, my dear.
How do you know where I live?
I saw you on the street and followed you.
My pretty, you deserve better than that.
You ought to live in a place worthy of you.
Buckingham Palace, I suppose.
That's the spirit I like.
Sit down, my dear. Sit down just for a moment.
You should have a place that would set off that fine body of yours... yellow hair and pale face.
Clothes to match, too, my dear.
Silk, eh?
And a bracelet, too?
Champagne to drink?
How would you like that?
And how am I to get it?
How do you think you're going to get it, my bright little bird?
I am no gentleman, no, but I have money.
Perhaps my looks don't please you.
- You ain't no beauty.
I am no beauty.
Perhaps you prefer a gentleman?
One of those fine-mannered, virtuous, and honorable gentlemen.
One of those canting hypocrites who like your legs... but talk about your garter.
My poor little innocent.
It doesn't know what I'm talking about.
Well, it's afraid of me, isn't it?
I ain't afraid of you.
Trying to steal my girl, are you, you dirty blighter?
- Come back, you.
I'll fix you...
- I'll knock your blooming...
- Get out of here, you!
- You couldn't have done it.
- Couldn't I, though?
This place was just made for it.
You're not going.
Forgive me, my dear.
You see, I hurt you because I love you.
I want you... and what I want, I get.
I grant you, I am no beauty... but under this exterior... you'll find a very flower of man.
Do you suppose I'd let anybody stand in my way?
You'll come with me?
You'll come with me.
- I presume your master is out.
- Yes, sir. So he is, sir.
He's always out when I call.
Tell your master I've had a letter from General Carew.
He tells me that Dr. Jekyll has not replied to any of Miss Muriel's letters.
- She's worried about him.
- I'll tell him, sir.
Anyway, I'm relieved to know he's not confined to his bed.
Begging your pardon, sir, it's my opinion that my master isn't well.
He hardly sees his patients, sir.
I haven't seen him myself for days at a time.
He often comes and goes by the back door of the laboratory, sir.
I must be going, Poole.
- It's me, dearie, your landlady.
Come in, Mrs. Hawkins.
How are you, dearie?
I can see for myself you ain't as fit as you ought to be... and no wonder.
- Here, I brought you the newspaper.
- Thank you, Mrs. Hawkins.
You're having a cup of tea, I see.
If you don't mind, dearie, I'll sit with you a minute.
I'm that done in.
Will you have a cup of tea, Mrs. Hawkins?
Thank you, dearie.
I don't mind if I do.
After all, a neighbor's a neighbor, says I.
Here's a bit of a surprise for you.
He's a lodger of mine, and a very likely lad he is, too.
His name's Arvis, and he says to me, says he:
"Who's the pretty lass what has the parlor?
"I wonder if she'd be inclined to drop in at the music hall with me...
"one of these fine nights.
"You ask her," says he.
Now, my advice, dearie...
No. I don't want to hear anymore about it.
Afraid of what Hyde will do to you, ain't you?
No, I ain't afraid.
If that blighter was my man, he wouldn't dare to lay a hand on me... not if he knowed what was good for him.
He's a brute, that's what he is, and my advice, dearie...
- I've come for the rent, sir.
- You'll get it when it's due.
What did that filthy harridan want?
She brought me the paper.
You aren't lying to me, are you, my little bird?
No, I ain't lying to you.
If I ever catch you lying... these are a trifle to what you'll get.
A trifle!
Sit down so that I can look at you, my sweetling.
- Say it aloud.
Don't you think I can read your thoughts, you trull?
I'm not good enough for you!
I'm not a nice, kind gentleman like that...
Nice, kind gentlemen who are so good to look at and so...
Please, my lamb.
My dear, sweet, pretty little bird, tell me that you hate me.
- Don't you, my lamb?
- Then you don't hate me?
If you don't hate me, you must love me.
- Isn't that so, my little one?
Isn't it? - Yes, sir.
How you must love me.
I want to hear you say it.
Come, my wench.
Say it! - Yes, sir!
I've got bad news for you, my dear.
I'm going away for a few days.
And upon my word, if you don't seem pleased.
- And you are pleased, aren't you?
- No, sir, I ain't pleased.
You are pleased!
But pleasure is brief in this world, my sweet... and yours is most uncertain... because you don't know when I'll be back.
- "No, sir."
Remember, you belong to me, do you hear?
If you do one thing that I don't approve of while I'm gone... the least little thing, mind you... I'll show you what horror means.
Are you going now?
Why, my dear, I'm surprised at you.
What a leave-taking that would be.
You wouldn't have me go tonight, would you?
Would you let me go tonight?
Quite unworthy of our great love.
No, my dear, I'm not going now.
I'm going to spend the evening here with you just as you want.
Say, "Just as I want."
- "Just as I want."
- That's right, my little bird.
The last evening is always the sweetest, you know.
And what a farewell this one will be.
What a farewell.
I don't know whether I shall be able to tear myself away from you.
Perhaps I shall go only as far as the door... and the sight of your tears will bring me back.
- Does that please you, my dear?
Why don't you show it, then?
Why don't you dance?
Why don't you sing?
Sing, my dear!
Sing, my little pigeon!
Get up and sing!
Look, my darling, how tight your garter is.
You mustn't wear it so tight.
It will bruise your pretty, tender flesh.
Thank you, Poole.
I shall be going out presently.
- Miss Muriel is returning to London today.
- See this key, Poole?
It's the key to the back door of the laboratory, sir.
I'll have no further use for it.
From now on, I'll use only the front door.
Deliver this to Miss Ivy Pearson, Diadem Court, Soho.
- Any message, sir? - None.
Deliver it and come away.
- Hyde'll kill you one day.
- I wish he would kill me. I wish he would.
Why don't you run away?
He'd find me wherever I was.
Then why don't you go to the police?
They'd fix this Hyde man.
There ain't nobody to help me. Nobody.
Who cares what becomes of the likes of me?
Miss Ivy Pearson?
- This is from my master, Dr. Jekyll, miss.
- Not Dr. Henry L. Jekyll?
He said there is no answer.
Good day, miss.
I don't know Dr. Jekyll.
Fifty pounds!
Well, he knows you, dearie.
Strike me pink!
Fifty pounds from the celebrated Dr. Jekyll.
He's a grand gentleman, always helping them what needs help.
Now, dearie, he sends you fifty pounds... shows he takes an interest in you.
Why don't you go and thank the gentleman proper?
Then you could tell him all about this here Hyde business.
He'll tell that blighter what's what.
You'll see if he don't.
You made me suffer so.
Now you tell me nothing.
I tell you no man ever needed another or loved another... as I need and love you.
I don't know what to say... but if you'd been ill that would have been different.
I was ill, my darling.
Why didn't you let me know?
I should have come at once.
I wasn't ill in body. I was ill in soul.
The sufferings of the spirit are so difficult to communicate... even to those who love you.
Do you think there's anything that has to do with you that I wouldn't understand?
I know that you're gentle and understanding, but...
I've played with dangerous knowledge.
I've walked a strange and terrible road.
Help me to find my way back.
Oh, my sweet.
When you're all mine to love and keep... I shall be patient as the earth with you.
Then let's not wait any longer.
Let us be married at once.
I want to with all my heart.
Take me. Take me soon.
I love you, and I want to help you.
I didn't expect to find you here, sir.
I've just made my profoundest apologies to Muriel.
- What about me? - Permit me to make them to you, sir... and to trust that you will be indulgent.
You haven't explained anything yet, sir.
I was not quite myself, sir.
In that case, of course, we'll say no more about it.
May I take further advantage of your indulgence?
- Your consent to our early marriage.
Harry needs me.
- I've already told you.
- We're too unhappy apart.
Please, Father.
This is the most important request of my life.
- I see no reason to change my mind.
- Isn't my happiness reason enough?
I assure you, sir, you will have no cause to regret it.
To be frank, Jekyll, I'm not at all satisfied with your conduct.
- I don't understand you, sir.
- I expect a man in your position... to observe certain traditions.
I want to see you more settled down before I entrust my daughter to your care.
You're too flighty, too impatient...
Believe me, these faults will be corrected.
- I give you my word of honor.
- Please, Father.
My whole life is concerned.
Well, I see you're overriding me.
Jekyll, remember you gave me your word of honor.
You shall be married next month.
Come to dinner tomorrow and we'll make a formal announcement to our friends.
By Jove, you've made me happy!
- I could sing or dance or roll a hoop...
- Jekyll, no.
Until tomorrow, my sweet.
Poole, my dear fellow!
- I'm a very happy man!
- I'm happy to hear it!
Happy, by Jove!
"...jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops."
May I take your cape, sir?
You may, Poole. You may, my dear fellow.
I'm going to be married, Poole.
In a few weeks, she'll be under this very roof... in this very room, as my wife.
Think of it, Poole, and let me see your face.
I beg to congratulate you, sir!
- "If music be the food of love, play on."
I beg your pardon, sir... but Miss Pearson is waiting for you in the consulting room.
Miss Pearson?
The young woman as you sent the envelope to, sir.
- She wishes to consult you, sir.
Show her in here.
- Why, it's you, sir!
Now who would have thought it?
Who would have thought that I'd find the celebrated Dr. Jekyll?
- So it was you who sent me this money.
The minute I laid eyes on you, I knew you had a kind heart.
- But whatever made you do it, sir?
- Someone told me that you needed it.
- Who, sir?
The important thing is that you have it.
And you're welcome to it.
I can't take it, sir.
Here's why!
It's a whip, that's what it is.
I'll give you a lotion to soothe that.
Thank you, sir, but a lotion won't do the trick, sir.
It's more than that, sir.
I need help, I do.
- It's Hyde, sir.
It's him that's done that, and more as I can't tell you, sir.
He ain't human, sir.
He's a beast.
He won't let me go, and I'm afraid to run away.
I've tried to drown myself, but I can't!
And if you don't help me... you as had the kindest heart in the world, sir... then give me poison so I can kill myself!
- Why didn't you go to the police?
You don't know him, sir.
He ain't a man.
He knows what you're thinking about.
I'm afraid of him now!
If he knows as I've been here today, I don't know what he'll do!
It won't be anything human, sir!
Keep him off me!
I'll do anything you ask!
You are good, you are.
You won't let me go back to him, will you, sir?
I'll do anything you like.
I ain't as bad as you think... and I ain't a bad looker, either.
I'll work for you. I'll slave for you.
I'll love you.
You liked me once, didn't you?
I give you my word that you will never be troubled with Hyde again.
He'll come back and kill me, sir!
He'll not come back.
But you don't know him, sir.
He ain't human, he ain't.
I've given you my word, and that I never break.
You'll not see Hyde again.
- You must go now.
Begging your pardon, sir, will it be a large affair?
General Carew's cronies, chiefly.
They wouldn't regard the marriage as authentic... unless it were formally announced at a dinner table, you know?
Perhaps soon you'll be giving a formal dinner yourself, sir.
I may, Poole.
- Should I call the hansom, sir?
- A walk through the park will do me good.
- We're early.
- I'm glad you are.
My dear, of course, I wish you all happiness.
- Thank you, Dr. Lanyon.
- How are you, General?
"Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird!"
"No hungry generations tread thee down..."
"Thou wast not born for death..."
But it is dead!
Rather late.
- It's very queer, I did not hear.
Of course, he is a very busy man.
He was probably detained.
Could anything have happened to Harry, Mr. Utterson?
On a night like this, my dear?
Why is he late, then?
There, my dear.
It's not his lateness.
It's your impatience.
He'll be along presently.
Here's hoping that Hyde rots wherever he is... and burns where he ought to be.
And here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll... will think of Ivy once in a while.
He's an angel, he is.
Here's to you, my angel.
Thought I wouldn't come back, didn't you?
You took the word of that sniveling hypocrite Jekyll against mine.
Jekyll's word against Hyde's?
I know everything you do and everything you think!
You went down on your knees before him... the man I hate more than anybody in the world!
"I'll slave for you.
"You're an angel, sir."
You wanted him to love you, didn't you?
I'll give you a lover now.
- His name is death!
- No! It ain't so!
Ain't it so, my little bird?
My little starling.
Why, you lying wench!
You've got his money here now!
You must be the devil.
There was nobody there but me and Dr. Jekyll.
He wouldn't have told you! No, he wouldn't!
Wouldn't he, though? Wouldn't he?
Listen, my dear.
I'm going to let you into a secret.
A secret so great... that those who share it with me cannot live!
I am Jekyll!
I am the angel whom you wanted to slave for and love!
And I'm going to take you in my arms now and hold you close!
Close, my little lamb.
My dove!
My bird!
There, my sweet.
There, my dove.
There, my little bride.
Isn't Hyde a lover after your own heart?
There's something horrible happening up there!
- You murdering devil!
- The monster did this.
- Let me in. I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.
- He isn't at home!
I know it, you fool!
He told me to wait for him.
- You'll have to come back later!
- Open that door, or I'll break it in!
My dear, I can't tell you how sorry I am... but I hope with all my heart that Jekyll will have something to say for himself.
I'll cane that scoundrel Jekyll if I ever set eyes on him again.
Something terrible must have happened.
I'm sure he can explain.
I forbid you to see this man again.
I love him, Father, and I'm going to marry him.
Muriel, you will have nothing more to do with that man.
- Give me pencil and paper, quick.
Be ready to carry a message for me.
- Hello, Briggs.
A messenger brought this a little while ago.
- He said it was very important, sir.
I'm going out, Briggs, but I'll be back soon.
You may go to bed.
I won't need you any more tonight.
- I come from Dr. Jekyll.
Come, sir.
You forget I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance.
I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon.
You know what I came for.
Dr. Jekyll sent me.
Here it is, but before I give it to you... I must be assured of Dr. Jekyll's safety.
- He's alive and safe.
- I'll take this to him.
- I must see for myself that he is safe.
- That is not your concern!
I warn you not to meddle.
Take me to Dr. Jekyll, or you'll not leave this room.
I warn you, Lanyon, to let me go.
If you make another step towards that door...
- I'll shoot.
- You don't know what you're doing.
Ask Jekyll tomorrow.
I will be sure of Dr. Jekyll's safety, or I'll make you answer for it.
For the last time, Lanyon, will you let me go?
Very well, Lanyon.
This will be on your own head.
Now, Lanyon... will you let me take this glass and leave without further question?
I've gone too far not to see this through to the end.
Think before you decide, I tell you!
Do you want to be left as you are... or do you want your eyes and your soul to be blasted by a sight... that would stagger the devil himself?
- I'm not to be persuaded by this rigmarole.
- Very well, Lanyon.
Remember your vows to your profession.
What you are about to see is a secret you are sworn not to reveal.
You who have sneered at the miracles of science... you who have denied the power of man to look into his own soul... you who have derided your superiors.
I can't believe what I've seen.
- I'm in your hands to do with as you wish.
- I'm a murderer, Lanyon.
- There is no help for you, Jekyll.
You've committed the supreme blasphemy.
I warned you... that no man could violate the traditions of his kind and not be damned.
That I still do not believe.
Don't be my inquisitor, Lanyon.
Don't judge me.
There is no help for you here or mercy beyond.
You're a rebel, and see what it has done for you.
You're in the power of this monster that you've created.
- I'll never take that drug again. - Yes.
But you told me you became that monster tonight... not of your own accord.
- It will happen again.
- I'll fight it.
I'll conquer it.
You cannot conquer it.
- It has conquered you.
I know it will not happen again.
You'll promise at least never to mix this drug again?
And what about Muriel?
I'll give her up.
I'll go to her tomorrow.
Oh, God... this I did not intend.
I saw a light, but I could not see where it was leading.
I have trespassed on your domain.
I've gone further than man should go.
I beg your pardon, sir. Dr. Jekyll is calling.
- Tell him we're not at home, Hobson.
- Father, no, for my sake.
He dares to enter this house?
Neither of us have the right to judge him.
The fellow's a blackguard.
I won't hear you say one word against him.
- Show him in, Hobson.
I don't know what he's done... but he's a finer and greater person than any of us.
I won't hear another word!
- I shall say it!
We've never understood him and never tried to understand him.
You tried to bend him to your will.
I haven't fought for him.
I don't know what's happened to him, but I know he's suffering... and it's our fault, mine more than yours.
I love him, and I'm going to help him.
I will have nothing to do with it!
I can offer you no welcome, sir.
Had the matter been left in my hands, I would have turned you from the door.
Darling, are you ill?
My sweet, why are you suffering so?
- Tell me what it is.
I've come to tell you...
I've come to set you free.
- Set me free?
If you ever loved me, tell me what's wrong.
Everything's wrong!
I no longer have any claim on you.
- But that's for me to say.
My darling, I beg you to tell me.
Whatever it is, I know you've done nothing base or mean.
Please, my dear!
Please, angel of God... don't say anymore.
Darling, is that all you have to say to me?
- Don't you want me any longer?
- Want you?
I want you so that I can envy the damned.
- I am damned.
Do you think I'd let you go?
Only tell me that you love me, and I'm yours.
Don't keep anything from me, darling.
- I love you, and I'll help you.
My beautiful... if I could take you in my arms, if I could only touch you...
Think of it.
I daren't even touch you ever again...
- in this world or the next.
- What are you hiding from me?
I'm beyond help, Muriel!
- I must give you up!
- But I won't let you!
- I'll go with you wherever you say.
I'll help you no matter what it is.
If I could only have you, I'd give my soul... but I have no soul!
I'm beyond the pale!
- I'm one of the living dead!
- I won't let you go!
My poor, dear, suffering love, be quiet.
Rest. Don't say anymore.
Be quiet and rest.
- Let me go. Let me go quickly.
I won't let you go.
- Sweetheart.
I give you up because I love you so.
This is my proof.
This is my penance.
Do you hear, oh, God?
Don't let me.
Help, Hobson!
Help, police!
I'll go ahead!
This way, officer.
This is the weapon, Doctor.
I know whose cane this is.
I can take you to the man.
Break it down!
Come on, Bill.
Give it a shove.
- This one's locked, too!
- Open in the name of the law!
- He's run out there through the back door.
- Don't stand there staring, you fool!
The door down there is locked on the outside.
Then go out through the front.
Come on, Scobie.
- You stay there.
- He has escaped, sir.
- Your man has not escaped.
There's your man!
- But, Doctor, this is impossible.
- I know it is, but there's your man!
You appear to be serious...
Close that door!
- Close that door there!
- Steady, boy!
- Drop that knife!
Look. Is any woman worth that?
Surely, you regret having betrayed your country.
- You can still have a chance...
- You're wasting time.
Come on, out with it.
Tell us, you fool!
That's her name, isn't it?
- Oh, shoot him.
She bewitches them.
- Why not? She bewitched all Paris.
- She's France's greatest enemy.
The woman has become a mania with you, Dubois.
After all, you're the only one in Paris that believes she's a spy.
It's very dangerous to accuse a woman who's so powerfully protected without proof.
- I'll get that proof.
One cold morning, you'll see your fine Mata Hari tied to one of those posts.
- Dine with me tonight?
- Thanks, no. - I'm to see your Mata Hari dance. - What?
A special soiree at LeMarchand's.
- How dare you. - It's to be smart and very private.
After all, there is a war going on.
Oh, well, some dance and some die.
And some will do both.
- Is that it?
- I think it is, General Shubin.
Something of an event to see a ship arrive from Russia.
Event?
Why, it's the first time in history, a flight over the German lines.
A great achievement.
Thank you, sir, but it's just sheer luck. - And a good engine.
- The dispatches?
Quite safe, sir.
I'm to deliver them to the ambassador personally.
May I present Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff of the Russian imperial air force.
Proud to meet such a brave young man.
But I was frightened to death all the way.
You'll hold yourself in readiness for a return flight to Russia as soon as our reply is ready. - Yes, Your Excellency.
- How long will it take to decode?
- Ten to 12 hours, Your Excellency.
Rush it, please.
General Shubin, please report back here tonight at 11:30.
This will call for immediate counsel.
We shan't forget.
General Shubin will give you your instructions.
Well, you feel like celebrating?
- Sleep is the only thing I'm interested in.
- Can I put you up for the night?
I still have my little place at Passy.
That is, if I can stay awake long enough to get there.
I'd ask you to dine with me, but I have to go to a reception right afterwards.
Mata Hari's dancing.
I'd be delighted to have dinner with you, sir.
- I'm not as tired as I was. - No?
The prospect of a good dinner, perhaps.
Yes, I suppose that's it.
After all, it's rather absurd to go straight to bed your first night back in Paris.
I think I do feel rather like celebrating.
If you can stay awake.
- Funny, I'm not even sleepy anymore.
That's all right, Rosanoff.
There'll be such a crowd there, one more won't matter.
Why, didn't you say you wanted to see Mata Hari dance?
Shiva, I dance for you tonight as the bayadères danced in the sacred temples of Java.
They say her mother was a sacred dancer, her father a temple priest.
You know she married a Dutchman. My dear, he used to beat her.
Really? I can't believe it.
She makes matrimony seem so dull.
I'd like to know her.
I feel that I do know her.
Madame Mata Hari, may a perfect stranger offer her appreciation?
- Your costume was exquisite.
And those earrings, are they Javanese?
No, they are from India.
They're so intriguing.
Andriani wants to see you at the Pavilion at once.
- Glad you like them. - Thank you.
Do you think...? Could you introduce me?
My boy, one doesn't meet Mata Hari on the spur of the moment like that.
Besides, I'm late now.
- Do you mind if I stay for a while? - No, no.
- I thought you were different.
Take this for me.
I know what you like.
I know all about men like you...
Permit me, mademoiselle.
- Oh, wasn't she marvelous? - Wasn't that a wonderful dance?
It wasn't a dance, it was a poem.
- Do you know her?
- Who doesn't?
I would give my right arm to meet her.
- To Mata Hari the incomparable.
- Unsurpassed.
- Priestess of the dance.
- High priestess.
- Goddess. Goddess of beauty.
The dancer is only as beautiful as the mood of her dance. - To Mata Hari.
Now, gentlemen, I'm terribly tired.
You'll have to excuse me.
You've been very, very charming.
Have you ever seen people's faces when you dance?
Have you any idea of the effect you have on them?
My mind is so far away when I dance.
I live in another age.
Centuries back when man and woman...
Brandy is bad for your heart.
I thought you'd given it up.
I give up a lot of things, but I take them back.
To me, anything I like is irresistible.
Unfortunately, it's in my blood.
What people you Russians are.
What charming savages.
- The Marquis de Signac. - Wait.
We're going to the Pavilion.
I like gambling.
They laugh, it's gay there.
Gay?
With Signac?
- Is that necessary?
He's very attractive, young.
Of course, he's not a general of the Russian imperial army so important as you.
- A diplomat...
- Or a traitor.
- I said it, traitor. - Now, quiet, Serge.
The time has come when I can't be quiet.
There's something growing here that's going to make me shout out the whole truth one day.
You want to die so badly?
I'm dead now.
Just as surely as though there were a bullet in my heart.
No, no, no. You.
Then why don't you give me up?
- I will.
- Well, do.
- So you're going to the Pavilion? - Yes.
- Caron, are you coming with us?
Sorry, my dear, but I have to be in court at 9. - Most important case.
- Too bad, too bad.
- Madame, I must be leaving.
I'm due at the embassy now.
- Tonight, late supper?
- No. Tonight.
Well, tomorrow, then.
I must help you to give me up.
Please, tomorrow.
Good night, General Shubin.
Madame Mata Hari's car!
To the Pavilion.
I have charted all gun emplacements and air batteries. Good.
You were attached to me as a cook? Yes, sir.
- Technical expert, eh? - Yes, sir.
- With the rank of captain.
- You're a good soldier?
- And a good German? - Yes, sir.
Some months ago, I furnished you with plans and specifications of a new weapon called the tank.
- Oh, yes, yes.
- You laughed, said it was impractical.
That's my belief, sir.
Captain, those impractical tanks went into action in the Somme yesterday costing your country 20 kilometers of front and 18,000 casualties.
- So you said before.
Here are a few more of your mistaken conclusions.
Correct them.
- Send Mademoiselle Carlotta here.
Well, I was able to deliver your message, Andriani.
Mata Hari is here.
Thank you, Carlotta.
- Any more orders?
- No, just run along and enjoy yourself.
Won't you have my seat?
It's lucky.
It will be so much nicer to watch you.
- A thousand francs for the bank.
- Ten thousand.
- Are you playing?
Never against you.
Any more bets?
- I want some chips for this.
We do not accept jewelry.
Perhaps one of the players.
You take it, madame.
He paid 10,000 francs for it.
Who paid 10,000 francs?
Whoever he was, he paid 10,000 for it.
I'll sell it for 5.
He had very good taste.
- It's an unusual ring.
- May I buy it for you?
It's bought.
- Going?
I may be back.
Well, you're looking magnificent tonight, my dear.
Last time I seemed only beautiful to you.
You must have something very difficult for me tonight.
No, it shouldn't be for you.
Important dispatches have arrived from Russia. All right.
I'm having supper with Shubin tomorrow night.
Splendid. Splendid.
He's at the embassy. - A conference.
- Probably concerns these dispatches. - Probably. - Then tomorrow night won't do.
You must see Shubin the minute he returns.
- I have arranged differently.
- Then change your arrangements.
I think you should handle Shubin yourself.
You get along beautifully.
- You're so alike.
- This is no time for any of your moods.
Something vital may be involved in this.
Something vital is involved in it.
- Good night, Andriani.
- Then I insist you see Shubin tonight.
A car will be waiting for you when you leave here.
You also insisted on that submarine job.
You finally had to do it yourself, as far as I remember.
How well you did it.
I intend to do a better job finding out who informed the French authorities.
Of course, there's Carlotta, she knew.
- And you knew. - And so did you.
You don't trust me, do you?
Yes. But you're capricious. You're a little bit mad.
You might give me away just for the excitement of the thing.
You might get me killed.
Unless I kill you first.
Hadn't you better wait until after tomorrow night?
A car will be waiting for you tonight.
I saw you admire this ring and I thought perhaps you would like to have it.
Well, as a token of my admiration for you.
How charming.
Madame, the car you ordered is waiting.
This young man has offered to take me home.
- Just for a little while.
- No, no further.
- Please, don't say that.
I think you're very absurd, very persistent and...
- Very nice?
- And very Russian.
I'm afraid of losing what I've found.
Hadn't you better take that off? As long as you insist upon staying. For a little while.
How long have you been in Paris?
I flew from London this morning.
I saw you once in the Bois.
You were so lovely.
I watched you till you drove out of sight among the chestnut blossoms.
Oh, Paris in the spring.
And now I'm here. - With you.
- But it's autumn.
But perhaps next spring, the war will be over you and I...
- I never look ahead.
By next spring, I shall probably be quite alone.
I mean, at least my thoughts will always be with you.
But you are so beautiful.
- Madame, the hairdresser can take you.
- I'm too nervous.
- And the marquis is calling for you.
- I'm too tired, Marie.
- And Baron Michel telephoned.
- Oh, I'm not interested, really.
- It's perfectly all right.
For the loveliest lady in all France.
It seemed like wasting life to sleep.
You're even more beautiful than I remembered you.
- Why did you come here?
- I couldn't help it.
The birds were singing and there was a softness in the air just like spring.
And you were the song of the birds and the warm brightness of the morning.
- It's very nice but...
- My heart was so full of you I had to come back and tell you I love you and take you to lunch.
It's almost 2:00 and I have an appointment.
But you can break it.
I must take you to lunch.
- I told you I have an appointment.
- And I told you to break it.
You're a fool.
The most conceited fool I've ever known.
What makes you think you have the right to burst in here?
But last night you told me that you loved me.
Well, that was last night.
Today I am very busy.
- The gentleman is leaving.
You are quite right. I have been a fool.
I won't make this mistake again.
Still a peasant, Ivan, huh? Still superstitious.
Evil spirits come in on the wind.
There's Madame Mata Hari.
Hurry up, open the door.
What on earth can he want?
Tell him... Tell him I can't see him.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Tell him that I shall be delighted.
My dear Dubois.
I'm afraid I'm intruding.
And inwardly you must be saying, "Confound this man Dubois. " - No.
No, not at all, but...
And if I seem to touch on matters that are how shall I say it, too intimate, you must forgive me it is because of my duty. - Yes?
You are very friendly with a lady perhaps the same one that you are expecting tonight.
Well, what if I am?
We consider this woman a very grave danger.
And as you know her better than anyone else, we want you to help us.
Why, what are you talking about?
- I'm expecting Mata Hari.
And Mata Hari is a spy. - In the pay of the Wilhelmstrasse.
- A spy.
Oh, my dear Dubois.
- Now you insult my intelligence. - Please.
Either that or you've lost your mind.
I'm quite sane, I assure you.
Well, if she's a spy, why don't you arrest her?
Because I need definite proof.
And that's why I am here.
This is an absolute joke.
It's really too good, you know.
Mata Hari, a spy.
You know, for a moment, I almost took you seriously.
Well, if the joke is as good as that, I'd like to hear it.
Or maybe it's too bad for me to hear.
Our poor friend Dubois here says that you are a spy.
Well, of course I am.
Everyone is Paris knows that.
Even Dubois, who knows everything.
- Couldn't you guess, Shubin?
- No, I think I'm getting old and stupid.
As I've amused you both so much perhaps I need not apologize.
- Please don't misunderstand...
Evidently, I'm mistaken.
I'm very sorry you found it necessary to put me in this position.
I spoke in confidence.
Please don't misunderstand, the whole thing was a joke.
Mother in heaven, I'm done for.
He said that you were a spy and that I was your...
I'm sure he suspects.
Well, he wouldn't come here if he suspected you.
It's me he's after. You're quite safe.
But he must know something.
Why should he come here at 11:00 at night?
The chief of the spy bureau.
It's a trap, of course.
Oh, what a fool I've been.
Nothing mattered.
Honor, self-respect, everything gone.
You can't give away like this.
- Dubois knows nothing. - He knows nothing.
Here I am facing dishonor, perhaps death and it means nothing to you.
You haven't even a word of pity for me.
You're all unstrung, Serge.
Nothing's happened.
Look at it calmly.
Laugh at it.
We'll laugh at it together.
When you hold me like this, nothing seems to matter. Nothing in the world.
This must never leave your hands till you have delivered it personally to the prime minister.
Should you be forced down in enemy territory pull this cord, and the contents will be completely destroyed.
The officials at Le Bourget Field will telephone you at your rooms as soon as flying is possible.
It is imperative that these dispatches be in Petrograd as soon as human means can contrive. Yes, Your Excellency.
Mr. Palin will have these sealed and delivered to you.
And now, goodbye and good luck.
- Thank you, Your Excellency. - Lieutenant. On your way, inquire if General Shubin has any further instructions.
Don't be so secretive.
I know that the embassy has received important news from Russia.
Please, don't ask me things.
But all you've got to say is yes or no.
Well, at least you can tell me how they came, by courier?
- By wireless, then.
By airplane.
The airplane from Russia?
Please, don't ask me anything more.
I can't get that Dubois out of my head.
Well, maybe you'd rather be alone.
You might as well be.
Your thoughts are not with me.
My thoughts are with you always.
Is that why you haven't kissed me for hours?
Lieutenant Rosanoff.
May I present Lieutenant Rosanoff.
I don't think so, madame.
I'm flying back tonight, sir.
I am to inquire if you have any further orders.
Surely you are not thinking of flying in this weather?
- Madame spoke to you.
- I know it, sir.
- Oh, never mind.
You can't expect monsieur to answer with a flight for Russia on his mind.
Safe voyage, monsieur.
Come back to us soon.
Paris in the spring with all those chestnut blossoms.
- Nothing, sir.
Madame spoke to you.
There was nothing to answer.
You're insolent.
- I advise you to return to your quarters.
I really can't apologize enough for him.
He must have been drinking.
I thought he was quite nice. And brave.
Flying all the way to Russia.
Well, this time you didn't have to tell me anything, did you?
Your conscience is quite clear.
I can't believe they'd send a dispatch that you know nothing about.
I've told you, I have nothing to do with political matters.
Mata, if you don't help me forget this ghastly business for a few hours, I'm going insane.
Of course you should forget them.
We both will.
Well, doesn't matter. - He wouldn't dare.
- Who wouldn't dare? Dubois.
What about him?
I was only thinking if he were to search my rooms while I am here...
But those official figures that you sent me...
You haven't destroyed them?
- How could you be so careless?
I suppose it was a little careless, but they're safely hidden away.
But Dubois may be there now.
It may be too late.
I wouldn't think of leaving you for something that can't possibly happen.
Please, I can't stand it.
I'd go myself, but I'm sure they're watching the house.
Please, now, don't lose a moment.
Telephone me the moment that you've destroyed them.
- Not safe. - Well, then come back here.
Of course I will.
- Hey, get out of the way! - Get out of the way!
Back up! Back up! Back up, will you!
Good evening, Mother Durand.
Call Andriani.
Tell him to send B-14 to Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff's at once.
Right here is the address.
He must wait outside...
Am I allowed to come in?
Why did you come here?
You finished your rendezvous early.
No, I ran away from it.
I'm afraid that Shubin was furious.
- I can't make you out.
- I can't either.
Are you still angry?
Haven't I the right to be?
- This morning you acted like...
And tonight I find you alone with Shubin.
Alexis, don't think wrong of me.
Artists need help and influence.
And Shubin can do so much to help my career.
- So I can imagine.
- But we are nothing to each other.
Please be glad to see me.
Are you sorry I came?
Well, then, look at me.
Please. Please forgive me.
Nice character in this room.
- This is the czar, isn't it?
- Who's the old gentleman there?
- And this Madonna?
- The Madonna of Kazan'.
My mother made a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Miracles to get it for me.
It's about 100 miles from our town.
She walked all the way.
What is it supposed to do?
- Bring you luck?
- Oh, no. It guards you from evil.
I had to kneel before the altar and promise Mother I would always keep a flame burning before it.
- And have you? - Of course.
My orderly has taken care of it all the time I've been away.
You're a strange boy.
Who loves you.
I love you as one adores sacred things.
What sacred things?
God country honor you.
- I come last?
- That's how you said it. - You come first.
Before anything.
Before anything?
There is so much light in here.
Put out that one too.
- The Madonna's lamp?
You said I came first.
But don't you understand that it's a holy lamp?
That I swore to keep it burning?
You wouldn't do that for me?
Why? Why do you ask me to?
- To see if you love me as you say.
- I do, Mata. I do.
Well, then put it out. If you love me.
I'll do anything, but please don't ask me to do that.
You are still here, sir.
- They didn't telephone? - Yes, someone did.
- Then the plans have been changed.
- I didn't answer.
Get me a taxi.
- You didn't answer?
- I told you to get me a taxi.
If anyone calls, you tell them I'm out. Quickly!
- Lieutenant Rosanoff? - Gone out.
- This is his servant.
- Where'd Rosanoff go?
- He went to the embassy. - Impossible.
We just came from there.
- He must have met with an accident. - But when?
- Oh, these Paris taxis.
I hope it's not a bad accident.
I have to see her. I'll wait here till I do.
Madame Mata Hari is not in.
Where would she be? Who are her friends?
- I don't know.
- General Shubin's?
- I've told you, sir, I don't know.
While I know you'll hate to leave Paris, I must ask you to go on a little mission.
- Yes? Where?
Oh, no. Don't do that to me, Andriani.
Think of how I've served, the work I've done.
- Have pity on me. - No, no.
There's no need of you becoming hysterical.
You're simply being ordered to Marseilles to meet our Spanish agent.
- What is so terrifying about that?
- It means my number's up. I know.
You think I'm a traitor.
I'm not. I'll swear by everything I hold sacred.
And what do you hold sacred?
There's a train tonight.
Brille has your tickets.
I won't go meekly to be slaughtered.
Remember, this is Paris, not the Wilhelmstrasse.
If you force me to be a traitor, I'll go to the French police and tell them everything I know.
You ought to know.
What's the matter, dearie?
Well, if everybody obeyed orders as loyally as you do...
- Any further orders for me?
Yes, here are the photographs of the dispatches.
Take that to Shubin, have him send them in the first diplomatic mail to Holland.
- You don't seem to be in good humor.
I'd think your success of last evening should put you in the best of spirits.
- To the contrary.
Surely, a simple job like that needn't have been unpleasant.
Most unpleasant.
Well, that's not unusual.
Marry...
Why is that so funny?
We are dispensing with Carlotta's services.
She seems to resent it.
Poor Carlotta.
She shouldn't have fallen in love.
I've warned her and you about that before.
I am surprised she didn't respect your wishes in the matter.
Ours is an exacting profession.
We're permitted no friends, no emotions, no personal life of our own.
I'm simply reminding you that a spy in love is a tool that has outlived its usefulness.
You're so subtle.
You imagine that I am in love?
I did think for a moment that you were taking this Rosanoff a little too seriously.
I never expect to see Rosanoff again.
I never want to.
But it's not because I'm worried by any threats of yours.
But I want you to see him again.
He may continue to be very, very useful to us.
- Not to me. - But...
I don't ever want to touch that boy's life again.
He did not report to the flying field?
Tell His Excellency I'll be there as quickly as possible.
- Ivan! My tunic. - Yes, sir.
I knew this was going to be an unlucky day when I woke up.
Get me a dozen orchids and take them to Madame Mata Hari.
Take this note along with it.
Meet me at the embassy.
No one would ever forgive that.
To spoil a man's supper, then come back and spoil his breakfast.
- What is it today?
More melodrama?
- No, no. - Today it is a farce.
Last night I was bold enough to hint at a relationship between you and a certain lady.
I've come to apologize because I was mistaken.
Oh, yes, because I discovered that this lady's inclinations are entirely elsewhere.
We older men merely furnish the soft lights and champagne.
The mood, as it were.
Youth whistles, and we? We spend the rest of the evening reading a book.
Just what are you trying to get at?
Merely this, that Mata Hari went straight to the rooms of young Rosanoff when she left here last night.
And the previous night, he was with her.
In what way does this concern me?
Well, it doesn't.
It merely illustrates what a fool I made of myself.
If you will pardon me, I have a most important engagement at the embassy.
I'm very sorry to detain you.
It's stupid of me.
But I had to drop in and apologize for my silly mistake.
- Very kind of you. Yes, charming.
- Did it work? - I don't know yet.
He seemed calm.
But there may be quite an interesting reaction.
A private air raid?
You cheat.
"Good morning, liar" would be more polite.
- Be quiet, you...
- We'll omit the pet names.
- Come to the point.
- Rosanoff. That's the point.
You were with him all last night.
Dubois told me.
Did he look through the keyhole?
- Don't deny it.
- I don't.
Of course I was with him.
He had information I wanted, and I got it.
You didn't think I went there because of...?
Can't you understand why Dubois is doing this?
- He knows what you mean to me.
You love that boy, and I know it.
Would I have taken this if I loved him?
Photographs of his dispatches to Russia.
Doesn't that convince you?
Yes, I'm quite convinced. Convinced it's not the whole truth.
What about the night before last?
Did he have the dispatches then?
No, he did not have the dispatches then.
But he had you, huh?
That's what Dubois said.
We older men supply the champagne. But when youth sings, the old fool stays home and pays the piper.
I think it's only fair to apologize to Dubois.
After all, he was right.
General Shubin on number three.
Yes? Dubois speaking.
Will you please repeat that? I didn't quite hear you.
You were right. She is a spy.
I'll give you all the proof you want.
Well, come over!
I'll keep her here.
Get me a car quick.
At last, I've got Mata Hari.
You've been cheating men all your life.
But there'll be 12 men you won't cheat, the firing squad.
No firing squad for me, Shubin.
It'll be your word against mine.
And after all, I have friends.
Paris will laugh at you.
A jealous, hysterical fool.
You and Rosanoff may get out of this, but I don't think so.
Rosanoff?
- And what has he to do with it?
- Everything. Rosanoff is a traitor.
He permitted you to copy his dispatches.
- Fortunately this time it isn't a question of anyone's word.
Proof that you gave me yourself.
You've stood that boy against a wall, just as surely as you're standing there.
I never knew that anyone could be so vile.
Vile?
Not at all, madame, I'm simply doing my duty.
How ironic, you love a man and send him to his death.
- Don't do it, Shubin. I beg you not to do it.
Hello? His Excellency's secretary, please.
- Leave him out of this. He's innocent.
- Hello, this is General Shubin speaking I must speak to His Excellency.
- Don't, don't do it!
- Hello, Your Excellency?
I'm coming to the embassy at once.
I must speak to you on a most urgent matter.
- Shubin, if you don't stop... - Hello, Excellency?
- I'll explain when I arrive.
In the meantime, order the immediate arrest of...
- What do you want here?
Why, you must be mad. Why haven't you left yet?
- But I...
- I told you. I told you I'm not for you.
Before I go, I want to tell you this.
Whatever you've been, whatever you are, whatever you will be we belong to each other.
- Alexis, it can't be.
Go away and forget me.
- Could you? Could you forget us?
- Women like me are trained to forget.
We mustn't admit a heart.
- You are lying. You know you are lying.
You're crying, Mata.
- I won't.
I won't until you come.
- It's your duty to go. - No.
Alexis, please go now.
When it's all over, if you still want me I'll come to you no matter where you are.
I'll come to you, I swear it.
But go now.
General Shubin, Dubois speaking.
Something strange about this.
You got something to open this door? - I'll get something.
- Yeah.
- That's hardly a surprise.
- Suicide.
- He's only been dead a few minutes.
Probably long enough for Mata Hari to destroy all the proof he told us about.
- Russian embassy.
Shubin was talking to His Excellency.
There was a woman's scream and a shot.
- See if she's overlooked anything. - Is he dead?
- Yes.
A woman's voice, huh? - Screaming.
And the word of a dead man.
All the papers are saying it's a suicide.
If everyone's convinced, what's the use of my hiding like this?
Dubois may be doing that merely to trap you.
- It's unfortunate you found it necessary...
- I'm the best judge of that.
- Have you still got your Dutch passport?
It doesn't suit my plans to have you arrested.
You're sailing tonight for Amsterdam.
I'll go anyplace gladly after three days of this.
It's too ridiculous.
And furthermore, your usefulness in Paris is permanently over.
Here is the list of the Allied agents in Belgium.
Commit those names to memory and then destroy it.
And report to H-12 immediately you arrive in Amsterdam.
- Madame sent for me.
I want him to get a letter through.
- For Lieutenant Rosanoff.
- Rosanoff?
Something's happened to him.
- Plane crash.
Just this side of the enemy line.
It's too late to do anything for him now.
No sense in your risking...
- Don't talk to me.
- Well, maybe I'm wrong, of course.
Maybe he's only injured.
Yes, that's it, I think.
Well, can't you remember?
You must remember.
Why is it so important to you?
- I'm going to find out.
- Wait a minute. Don't lose your head.
After all, he's not dead, he's only injured.
- And where is he?
- I don't know, some hospital, I suppose.
- Well, I'll find out.
- And be arrested?
The police are probably looking for you now.
- Remember, you have your orders.
- What do I care for your orders?
You can't frighten me.
I'm not Carlotta.
I'm Mata Hari and my own master.
Here are your orders.
- Not so loud, someone will hear you.
- Oh, so you resign?
Very well, Mata Hari, I accept your resignation.
- You'll let her resign?
- My dear Durand, you ought to know. The only way to resign from our profession is to die.
Flowers, madame. Flowers.
- Two francs.
- Room 1, that corridor.
Could you tell me...?
Could you tell me where Room 1 is?
I'm afraid you'll have to ask someone else.
Sister Teresa, some water, please.
It's all my fault, Alexis.
If I hadn't kept you...
If I'd let you go sooner, this wouldn't have happened.
It would have happened just the same.
Really, you mustn't blame yourself.
I'll spend my life trying to make it up to you.
Oh, but I'm going to be all...
- I'll be out of here any day now.
- On that day, we'll be married.
You asked me, didn't you?
There is so much ahead of us.
Everything. But I must tell you something.
And as soon as the war is over, we'll go away to all the places that were made for lovers.
- And, oh, the things we'll see together.
- Don't, please.
- I don't want to frighten you, but...
It would be glorious to go with you but I may never be able to see all those splendid things.
Is it your eyes?
Here are your eyes.
What's wrong with them? With those "ridiculously long lashes," as you said.
Now, please, it isn't worth crying about.
I'm happier this moment than I've ever been in all my life.
They aren't very optimistic. But you know what doctors are. - They don't know anything.
I'll get you great specialists.
They'll make you see.
We'll travel all over the world till we find the right man.
I'll never leave you again.
Gentlemen, I appeal to you.
That man, he's been molesting me.
- Back to Paris. Quick.
Madame, I have a warrant for your arrest.
Be careful you don't have to apologize again, Dubois.
Now, Monsieur Dubois you say that General Shubin admitted over the telephone that Mata Hari was an enemy spy? - Yes.
- And he had proof that she was a spy?
General Shubin told you, also, that she was there with him while he was talking with you? - Yes.
You went there immediately, and you found that Shubin had been murdered? - Yes.
Does the defense wish to question the witness?
No, I don't care to prolong this farce.
You've not brought to that stand one human being who has said this is so.
- "I know it. I saw it.
I swear it. "
- The counsel for the defense evidently has as poor a memory as his client.
Didn't General Shubin say that Mata Hari was in his rooms at the time he was telephoning?
Dubois said that Shubin said that she was there.
We cannot blame Monsieur Dubois, of course for accepting too readily whatever information was given to him.
But has he any proof that it was Shubin who spoke over the telephone?
And now I want that.
I demand that the prosecution produce some one witness who will swear to one definite thing or I demand that Mata Hari be acquitted with the apologies of the court.
There is a man who saw Mata Hari at General Shubin's that morning.
This man was overheard by a nurse in the hospital discussing this fact with the prisoner.
Overheard. Overheard. Something more overheard.
Why don't you bring him here and let me question him under oath?
I had hoped to avoid bringing to court a brave young officer recently blinded in the course of heroic duty. But if the defense demands it, summon Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff.
He knows nothing of this.
All he can say is what I said to him as I came out of that room.
When you came out of what room, Mata Hari?
What room?
Shubin's room!
Your witnesses were perjured.
You have no alibi.
When Shubin called you a spy over the telephone, he told the truth.
And you knew it, and you shot him in an attempt to save yourself.
But it has not saved you, Mata Hari.
You stand proven an enemy of France.
Sister Teresa, will you read this to me once more? For the last time.
- For the last time?
"Dearest, I shall not be able to see you or even to write to you for some time to come.
A sudden attack, nothing really serious, has caused my removal to a sanitarium.
You must not be alarmed because the only pain I feel is that of being without you. "
"And when it becomes too sharp I think of all the happiness we have had together and that which we are going to have.
Then I can bear anything.
Good night, Alexis.
Tomorrow is sure to be glorious. It brings me closer to you.
In the name of the French Republic, this court finds the accused, Mata Hari guilty of espionage and communicating military information to the enemy.
Therefore, this court, by virtue of articles 205, 6 and 7 of the military code condemns this woman to be shot to death by rifle fire.
Any news about the reprieve?
We are expecting her lawyer any minute.
Oh, it's getting close to 5:00.
Give her that.
Cognac.
That'll put heart into you.
- You're a good man.
Because I give a dying woman a drink?
You don't want jewelry and you can't use clothes.
- What can I give you?
- There's nothing.
We have everything we need.
Everything you need?
- We serve God and are content.
I wonder if I could be like that if I had to do it all over again from the beginning.
That's how I am, and that's how I had to be.
No, little Sister, mustn't waste your tears on me.
Oh, he's come to bring the reprieve.
My dear, dear child.
- No?
- I tried everything.
I appealed to the highest quarters.
I spent a whole hour with the president, who is one of my oldest friends, but...
What about Alexis?
That's all settled, just as you wanted it.
He's downstairs now.
- I'll...
Will you give him this afterwards?
- And be very gentle with him.
- Of course, my child.
I hope I have written the things that'll help him most.
And if I haven't, perhaps you will know what to say.
I'll know what to say. That in having your love even for a little while he had more than most men ever have.
Just tell him that no matter what he hears about me and he will hear things that my love for him was honest.
Except that he must be happy. Must laugh and love.
And then, someday, when he's an old man and his grandchildren ask him about Mata Hari he must tell a great lie, say that she was a wonderfully good woman.
And that'll be my heaven.
- Now will you ask him to come up?
Sister, the young man is blind.
I've told him that this is a sanitarium.
You must be careful.
They will.
They understand.
Take care of the steps.
Madame, I'm leaving the door open so that the visitor won't hear the rattle of the lock.
We'll look at the patient in the next room and leave these young people alone.
- Thank you, doctor.
This is most irregular.
And after the operation, how much longer will you have to stay here?
- I'll be well soon, I hope.
- And so will I.
The doctors say now that with time and the right treatment there is every chance I'll see again.
See you again.
That's the one thing I needed to give me strength.
Mata, you are telling me the truth?
It isn't a dangerous operation?
No. No, it's very slight, really.
And in a short time, we'll forget all this and be so happy.
Just the same, I can't bear to think of you suffering.
- Promise me you won't worry about me.
Now, promise me.
You know what operations are.
Even the slightest, there's always a chance.
Promise me. If something should happen to me you won't grieve too much, that you'll carry on.
But nothing will happen to you.
Well, then hold me.
I won't be afraid if you hold me.
Is it time?
The doctor and the nurses, they've come to take me.
Why need it be so early?
Well, they always operate early in the morning.
And the sooner I go, the sooner it's over.
All right, but you mustn't be frightened.
I'll wait here till they bring you back.
I don't want you to.
Monsieur Caron is waiting to take you back.
He'll let you know just how I am.
- You are afraid.
- You needn't be.
The anesthetic is unpleasant, but that's all.
- Goodbye, my beloved.
- Oh, you sound so tragic.
Courage. Courage, my dear.
God, save her.
And if you must take her, take me too.
Hello, Em.
Hello, Fred.
I think you'll like me in this dress when it's done.
Have you broken your umbrella?
I made you steak and kidney pudding for tonight.
And I was wondering whether you'd like to stay in and listen to the wireless or go out to the pictures.
The pictures then, dear?
Damn the pictures and the wireless and the office.
I want some life!
Life, I tell you!
Like that. What you want, dear, is some little liver pills and some fruit torte.
I don't want any pills.
I want some of the good things of life.
Money.
Why should you be able to spend less on yourself than some women do on their rotten poodles?
Why shouldn't you have a hairdresser and a lady's maid?
Why, Fred, I never expect those things. I know, that's just it. The good little women like you don't want enough.
Get out of there!
I think the best place for us is the gas oven.
To talk about gas ovens when we've a roof over our heads. Food, beds... oh, and lots of things.
Is that the post? Oh no, it'll be the gas bill.
Serves you jolly well right if it is, talking about gas ovens.
Oh, thanks.
Have you left everything ready for me outside, Mrs Porter? - Yes, Ma'am.
Good night, Ma'am.
Good night, Mrs Porter.
Is it the income tax?
Em!
Quick, look.
See this, Em?
- Now you can have some real clothes.
Hurry up, old James, you'll be late for the office.
You know, Em, I always got into the sea.
I hear it's a bit rough in the channel.
Hello. We're off.
Come on, Em. Let's take a snap.
I say, Em, I... I think I'll pop down and get you some sick... I mean, magazines.
See you around.
Oh, my god.
The curtain's gone up too soon.
They're not dressed.
I mean...
Somebody just pinched me.
You know where.
You leave it to me.
So long, folks.
See you tomorrow, and have a great trip Ma'am.
What's in that parcel, Fred?
I couldn't wear this.
People will think we aren't married.
Don't feel a bit as if we are.
One of the sailors told me it was a bit rough outside.
I say, Em... I think I'll go down to the cabin and... I mean, you know... to see if everything's all right.
All right, Fred.
Oh, excuse me, I beg you.
- Oh, hello, Commander.
- Hey, how do you do, Miss Emory?
Are we going to have a lot of fun and mischief?
Well, I hope so.
We're not off yet.
Just about that much.
It's a marvelous night, - isn't it?
- Yes, isn't it?
Is your husband feeling better?
Oh, yes, he's much better.
He's really a very good sailor, but he's not used to it.
Yes.
Oh, Commander Gordon, aren't you coming down?
We're all waiting for you.
Did you mind if I have one more pipe in peace?
You know, these bright young people make one feel awfully old at times. Oh, I like to see people enjoying themselves.
How do we go now, sir?
Would you like to try a little something?
Ask my wife. She'll get me a grave.
Here's another.
May I draw on this?
Huh?
You're the craziest person, really.
You're delicious.
I could sit and listen to you all the afternoon. You're laughing at me.
No, no, I'm not, really. Funny you'd say that because I always find it so difficult to talk to people. - Do you?
But not to you.
I find it quite easy... much easier than I could to my husband.
- Do you know I...
- I should better...
- I beg your pardon. - No you.
No, please, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Well, what I was saying was, you know, I couldn't understand it at first. But now I think I know why it is.
- Well, you see, you're just a man and not my husband.
And if you get bored with me, all you've got to do is to get up and go away and it doesn't matter.
Yes, but it would matter very much.
Have you ever been in love, Mr Gordon?
No, I can't say that I have.
- That's a pity.
- Where to knock.
That's a pity because it's difficult for you to understand. You see, I love Fred and he loves me.
And naturally, I want him to think well of me.
When I talk to him, I'm always so frightened of saying something foolish. You see, he's terribly clever. And I'm not, eh?
Oh, I think you're interesting and amusing.
- And you like the things that I like. - Yes.
Well, that doesn't take much doing, does it?
No, I suppose not.
No, I don't think you're clever.
No, I supposed I'm not really.
I say, it's a very lucky thing that, uh, - that we're not in love, isn't it?
- Yes. Isn't it?
Love is a very difficult business, Mr Gordon.
You'd be surprised.
It makes everything difficult and dangerous.
You know, I don't think love makes people brave like they say that in books.
I think it makes them frightened when they're happy and... sadder when they're sad. You see, everything's multiplied by two...
sickness, death, the future.
It all means so much more.
Oh, I'm afraid I haven't made myself very clear.
- Yes, you have, but...
- You see, love's a wonderful thing, Mr Gordon.
The kind of love that you're describing must be.
You know, I think I shall have to try it. You must. You're just cut out for it.
But do be sure you get the right girl.
It'd be a crime if you were wasted.
Mrs Hill... will you give me an honest answer... to a straight question?
Why, yes. Are you trying to pull my leg?
Pull your leg?
I don't quite know why I said that.
It's rather foolish, isn't it.
- Forgive me, will you?
- Oh, yes, of course.
I rather certain to say. I mean...
Hello, Gordon.
- Why, hello, Colonel.
- Oh, and, um, this I presume is Mrs Gordon.
Oh, there you are. Now, come along, Ken.
You distinctly promised me you wouldn't run away. I want you to help me feed the seagulls.
There you are.
No, no, Commander, no, no, no.
If I may intrude for just a teeny weenie second.
It's just struck me, I have the very thing... - for your poor ill husband. - That's very kind of you.
I have a perfectly marvelous plaster.
You just put one on and the effects? - Magical. - But what do you...?
That's worn on the, um... when the... next the skin.
I guarantee he'll be up tomorrow, I really do. I guarantee it.
- Oh, it's nothing.
I really only carry them for the benefit of the less fortunate.
Don't you think the world would be a better place, Commander, if we all did that sort of thing a little more often?
Yes, I suppose so. I'm afraid I don't... - bother very much about other people.
- I don't believe it. No, no.
I don't believe it
Shall I fetch the plasters later on? What...?
Oh, yes, yes.
Now, Commander, what about a 4 at bridge?
I'm afraid not.
I promised to take Mrs Hill for a stroll. If you'll excuse me.
Ready?
What a perfect gentle knight you are, Commander.
Like to see a ship... we were once passengers in?
Oh, Gordon.
I called you Gordon. Why, that's a christian name, too.
I liked it.
It sounded kind of friendly.
The mister got lost out here, didn't it?
Yes, I'm glad.
Let it stay lost.
It's rather good, eh? Gordon. Just...
I feel quite dizzy.
Well, upon my soul,
I've been looking for you everywhere, when you were here all the time.
- Behold, the wonder worker.
And tomorrow your husband will be up and looking after you again.
But poor Commander Gordon... will be going to right into the background.
There, there. I'm only joking. Get my high spirits?
Get my fun.
Well... I must be going.
Well, I suppose I'd better be saying good night, too.
Is it all right?
Yes. From the office.
What's for dinner, Em?
Steak and kidney pudding?
What, again?
Every other night it's steak and kidney pudding.
Gosh, Em, I'm feeling fine.
I say, Em, these deck games look good to me. - Yes.
- Drat it!
- I'm most terribly sorry.
- I say, damn it. You're ought to be... more careful, you know.
I mean, might have knocked my eye out.
They ought to have a rope round here or something. I say, old man, no need to go on like that.
It was quite an accident.
The princess couldn't help it.
Don't be angry with him.
I am not offended.
Get down. You'll fall.
Ah, Fred.
How lovely.
Ah, my bathing suit.
- You'll stay here? - Yes.
Don't run away without me.
Have you seen the Colonel? - No.
Oh, you have.
He's there all the time.
Now, Colonel, don't forget you're coming with me to buy my carpet.
What?
Yes, you'd better come now, I think.
Don't forget you're coming with me to buy my carpet, will you?
Fred, isn't it lovely?
Em, I shouldn't take that with you. It makes you look like a tourist.
To think that place has been there all these years.
All those strange people.
Having their babies. Dying. Cooking their funny meals.
Strange. It's been there all these years. Well, you don't think they built it especially for us overnight, do you?
Well, you needn't snap my head off.
That's the 3rd time you've spoken to me like that since yesterday. - I'm sorry.
- Ah, Emily!
Oh, your husband. He looks so good.
Don't he? - Anyone ashore?
- Oh, yes. Oh, come. Let us go.
Hello.
Aren't you going ashore?
Yes. Well, there's not too much time. May I carry that for you?
- Oh, thank you.
- Come on, Dad!
Em, are you coming bathing with the princess and me?
No, I'm staying with Miss Emory to buy her carpet.
Oh well, my dear, really, that's quite all right.
I sad, I don't mind.
Yes, I like this, I think.
Commander, really.
Why, do be careful, dear.
I do like that.
There now, Mr Gordon.
You'll carry this for me, I'm sure...
Well, he's gone.
Well, Colonel, you can carry it.
Good eve...
Good morning.
Shall we go?
Fred may be looking for me.
Yes, I suppose we'd better.
Our little twin beds, huh?
Uh, shall we?
My poor heart.
You make him jump so.
You feel?
Cabin number 19.
Not right away.
You must be what you call indiscreet.
You go have your promised dance with the, um, gossip woman.
Then she will not look for you.
Cabin number 19.
Don't you think my shepherdess costume makes me look young?
How old?
Can I get you an ice?
Oh, yes, please do.
Aah!
I'm drunk, Emily.
And, if you are, I am, too.
Exactly.
Hello, Em.
- Hi, Gordon.
Sit down.
I'm tight.
What are you gonna have?
All right.
I'll get you something.
Steward.
Oh, hello, Fred.
Hello. Hello, um, Emily.
I sit there.
Why, hello, princess.
What you're going to have?
Oh, I think, um, a brandy and soda. Brandy and soda?
Oh, steward, a brandy and soda as well, please.
Have you a cigarette, Fred?
Yes, I think.
What do you want, a cigarette?
- Please. - I have one.
- There you are.
It's a gorgeous night outside.
Oh, have you seen my husband anywhere about?
I think he went ashore with the princess, madam.
Well, uh... Look here, why not let me show you around town, eh?
All right, when can I go.
- I say, Colonel.
When's there a boat leaving again for shore?
There's one going in 5 minutes, sir.
- 5 minutes. We're going? - Splendid.
Come on, let's go on the ground.
You've been thinking a lot.
Oh, I'm as much at sea as ever.
It's a bewildering business, this, this being at sea.
But on the night of the carnival, I knew that Fred and the princess were... were drunk, too.
Compared with them, we were a pair of sober sods.
But I can't feel sorry.
About them?
About us.
Tell me, Fred, have you not a regret for treating Emily so?
Well, I wouldn't be human if I had no regrets.
Naturally, I feel for her.
I'd be a pretty poor sort of fish if I didn't.
Of course, she's fond of me I know.
I suppose we were happy enough... in our own quiet little way until we came on this trip... and I met you.
After that, of course, it was all out.
I mean, how can I be expected to love Emily when I... when I love you?
Water is a good drink, but champagne is better, yes? That's it.
That's it.
And having developed taste for champagne what's the use of trying to stick to water?
Oh, well, maybe she will find someone who is nearer her own level. Yes.
She'll probably be much happier.
Of course, you know, she never really understood me.
I was a bit too much for her.
Like to see a ship... we were once passengers in?
It's running away from us now.
Em.
Is it going to be this?
You are going to let me take care of you, aren't you.
Let me make this figure real.
After all, you know, you drew it.
Isn't it marvelous to think that after tonight we should always be together?
Yes. But don't forget, Fred. Tomorrow when we go ashore,
Oh, yes.
- My hand.
- Sorry.
You know, I can't help feeling a bit worried about Em.
I hope she'll be all right.
- Fred... - Hmm?
If a woman can't hold her man, there is no reason why he should take the blame.
I suppose you're right.
You always are.
Shall we go inside?
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip... hooray.
I've seen it all along.
Look at the way you made yourself an absolute slave to him.
Anyway, I'll be able to make you happy now.
You wouldn't go back to that dull life again?
- Fred may have to go back.
- I told you, he's fickle.
If he were a man, I'd feel ashamed. As it is, I frown for him.
Bluff.
Empty shirt. - Fool.
It used to make my heart ache to hear you worship that overgrown sham.
The way you kowtowed to him.
He was just a great baby masquerading as a big, strong man.
I've held my tongue... because I hadn't the heart to open your dear eyes.
But now, you're not his wife anymore. Yet a princess fell in love with him.
Princess.
Do you know why Fred succeeded so admirably with her royal highness?
Because she's not a princess.
She's just a common adventuress and he was the biggest asset aboard. She set her trap to him and caught him.
Why didn't you warn him?
Much good that wouldn't done, sweetheart.
You can't teach the Freds of this world.
- What will happen to him?
- I don't know, and I don't care.
When she's spent all his money, she'll drop him like a hot brick.
- Then he can come to his senses.
It's not our business, sweetheart.
We've got to forget him.
But don't you see, I can't, Gordon.
A wife's more than half a mother.
And I've been married to him for over 8 years.
It's a long time, you know that?
Oh, think what it means, Gordon.
I hate to.
No, Gordon.
I can't!
Ask him to stop.
Fred... I've been down to make certain.
That must be the dinner I sent for.
Come in.
Oh, uh, waiter. Put the bill on the table there.
Fred?
Perhaps you would wish to speak alone with Fred?
I will wait downstairs for you, Fred.
I'll go and get a shirt.
Thank you... Princess.
You did not go with him.
You little fool. You damn little fool.
Oh, I was... I was just fixing up to go bathing with the princess.
You don't want to come, do you?
I suppose you'll be going somewhere with Gordon.
- He's what?
- He's gone to his home.
Up country.
Well, fancy that.
He wanted to take me with him.
What's that?
He loves me.
And how far has this thing gone?
Fred, don't start play acting over this.
- It'll only make things worse.
- Stop play acting, huh!
Pretty state of affairs.
Come up here, told that old man's in love with you.
- Excuse me for play acting when...
- Yes, yes, Fred, let's take all that as said!
I'd have gone with him if it hadn't been for you.
- For me? - He'd have made me happier.
- But damn it tho, you've no right...
- When I said I would, he started to show me you...
as the outside world sees you.
Not as I've seen you, blinded by love and... all this long time together.
You're ju... you're mad.
Yes, I was to have missed my chance. But after what he said...
Oh, come in!
- Can I clean...?
- Get out of here!
Well, what did he say then?
Just the truth, Fred.
He said you were a sham, nothing but a bluff.
I'll smash him to bits, is what I'll do.
He wouldn't have any fear of you, dear.
He knows you're just a great big coward.
If you thought so much of him and listened to all his dirty lies about me, why the devil didn't you go with him?
Because I recognized your faults. Whereas, before I'd always dressed you up in all kinds of silly virtues.
Oh, very much obliged, I'm sure.
I saw that I was the wife for you.
That without me, you'd be lost.
I couldn't allow that.
It wouldn't be right, would it?
Not right, eh?
And you think that after the way you've behaved...
I suggest that if you want to get the thing straightened out and not wreck everything through the... this trip, you've got to do something about this.
Well, what's that?
She's a sham, too.
You don't tell me.
Is anybody or anything real then?
And in what way is the princess a sham, if it's not troubling you too much?
Because she's not a princess at all.
Because she's just a common, cheap adventuress. And she only threw her hat at you because you were the one man on board...
- big enough fool to. - Stop, you don't know that!
- Shut up, damn you!
- It's true!
I'll shut up when I've said... You think she'd have...
That's all.
I'll go to the princess.
My things can be sent on.
Good-bye.
Just a minute.
"Dear...
"knowing you, I accept your verdict.
"You have made your choice and I see the way of it.
"I don't know much about love,
"how long it lasts or what the remedies are,
"but I love you, Emily.
"So much... "that I can't write anymore...
"only blessings... and prayers for you."
Don't you dare say, "I told you so."
- She...
- Caught the train to Rangoon.
But I can't make it out why she would...
Do you think that this has got her...
Give it to me. What do you mean by hiding my letters?
She's gone. She was a fraud.
She thanks me for my company and says her father kept a... cleaning shop in Berlin.
That... little swine.
That's what she is.
The swine!
To treat you like that.
Oh, I could...
What a fool she's made of me.
What a fool! Oh, Fred.
Poor Fred.
Oh, for god's sake, keep your pity!
But I tell you again,
If you say "I told you so," I'll strangle you.
I will, I swear I will.
Wish I could strangle her.
And all the time she was just a rotten street walker.
I'll set the police on her, that's what I'll do. But you can't.
She hasn't done anything.
I mean, not broken any law.
Or, hasn't she just?
That's all you know.
- She's only robbed us of £1,000.
- What? - You want now clea...?
But how... how could she?
Oh, she told me a pack of lies about an expected remittance or something.
Anyway, it was only to be a loan.
Well, not a loan exactly because we were pooling everything we had. And then there were our passages to Australia...
Of course, I was going to see the jeweler, all right.
Well, you were gonna run away with your precious Gordon.
Think of that tart heading for Burma with 1,000 of the best in her pocket and shoving her fingers to her nose.
How in God's name are we going to get home, Fred?
Shall we have enough?
That's all right, darling.
- All hands on deck!
- You'll be all right, soon.
What's up, Em?
Em, what's happened?
- We stopped. - I don't know, I...
- You must know.
- I don't.
It was a big bang and something fell and hit you on the head.
You're being stunned.
Can't get the damn thing open.
The bolt!
Why can't you open this door, you fool?
- Help!
Help! - Help!
- Help! - Help!
There go the lights, Em.
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
It's no use, Fred.
We can't get out, Em.
We're dying.
Oh, Em, for God's sake.
Fred... do you mind very much?
Not now. I did at first.
I'm...
Em...
I'm sorry. What for, Fred?
There's only been you. There... There's only ever been you.
It's daylight.
Look at the port hole.
Don't do that. You'll let the sea in.
Be quicker anyway.
The gangway is just outside.
If only we'd thought.
Oh,
I'll go first to see if it's all right.
Come on.
Don't forget, feet first.
- Ooh. Ahh.
Have they gone, Fred?
Don't go sneaking up to a chap like that.
It's scary enough without playing funny tricks.
Of course they've gone.
They'll reckon it's gone down hours ago instead of floating on like this.
Why did it, Fred?
How the dickens do I know?
The silly things you ask.
What the hell do we do now? That's the question.
Well, we want a boat or a raft or something.
You don't tell me.
Fred, hadn't we better go and find some clothes or something?
Somebody might come.
Let's see what's in here.
I'd better give you a hand with these.
I'm sorry.
- All right?
That's better.
There, revolver.
He sat next to me at dinner.
It's getting on my nerves. Can we get a drink.
I know.
We'll have a little brandy.
I tell you one thing: we'd better get a move on and find some way out of this, make a raft or something.
- Fred. - Mm-hmm. - Here.
Listen. - What?
Do you think it's mad if I use the gentleman's?
Ours is underwater.
Yes.
Go on.
No sense in being suburban.
Fred, look!
A Chinese junk.
That's right. There we are.
How do yo do?
Uh, good afternoon.
Fred, look!
She's going to have a baby.
Mm! Best meal I've eaten for ages.
Much better than all those swell meals we had in Paris.
I like being shipwrecked.
It's not half as bad as people make out.
Nothing ever is. Why, this is as good as yachting.
Dullard dummies, aren't they?
Ah, might as well better than.
Hello, what's the old boy up to?
Help me up, Fred.
Ooh! Sat on a knot.
- I'll tell you one thing, Em.
Well, that ship going down has done us a bit of good in a way, you know.
Well, don't you see?
That £1,000 pounds I gave... I lost. Well, we can say it went down with the ship.
Why, yes.
And then we'll be able to get some more... and buy some clothes and things when we land.
When we land.
Fred, do you hear that?
A baby.
What do you mean?
That woman's had her baby.
- How could she?
- Well, anyway, she has.
Isn't it wonderful.
I'd better go and see if I can help.
Better keep out of it, Em.
They don't want us.
We'd only be in the way.
I suppose so.
There, there.
Don't cry, Em, old dear.
We're all right, Em.
We've got each other.
Oh, the poor little mite.
Gosh, isn't it ugly?
You mustn't do that! You mustn't!
No newly born baby could stand it!
- Stop it, please stop!
- Don't be silly, Em.
How would you like a chinaman to tell you how to manage your baby?
Besides, look how strong it is.
I bet that chap holding it is the father.
See how proud he is of it?
I made a nice steak and kidney pudding and I've ordered the papers and I had the wireless batteries charged.
The air ministry issue the following gale warning.
Strong northwesterly gales all coasts of the British Isles. Rain in most districts, some hail or sleet locally.
Channel crossings extremely rough.
What are you looking at, Fred?
I was wondering if we could get a pram down that passage.
- But are we going to be here?
- What?
When you get your new job as traveler for the firm, I'm going to a bigger, better house than this. - Oh, but you so.
Whatcha wanna move for?
- But, there won't be enough room here.
Oh, I never heard a thing so ridiculous.
We've been here for all these years. - Well, what do you want to move for?
- That's just one of the very reason why.
Well, I'm the gentleman going to stay here.
Good morning, Santa.
I picked these flowers for you by the side of the road.
Bye, till tomorrow.
Good morning, Ma'am
Good morning, Cosme.
Where's Santa?
She'll be here soon.
Can I have bread and honey?
Mother, I'm going to see the soldiers.
No, stay here! Santa.
But, but, nothing will happen to me, Cosme, will go with me.
Do you have fresh water?
Fresh from this morning!
You're beautiful, and what a nice name you have, Santa.
I was named after my godmother, she was Italian.
Listen Santa, I'll be staying for a while.
We could meet later to talk.
Cosme, tell Santa to come quickly.
Your mother is looking for you
I'm coming!
Promise?
AND SO IT WAS THAT D AY... AND AFTERWARDS...
I'm ashamed to be in my house.
Don't tell anyone what happened. Not even your shadow!
Please, don't leave me.
Don't be such a coward, no one knows anything.
Let's go Santa, it's late.
My brothers!
Hurry up!
Who were you talking with?
I was talking to myself...
We've told you not to go out alone at night.
There's a lot of gossip about you.
If it's true, we will have to do something.
We would kill any man who was involved with you.
Lets go!
The soldiers are leaving, the general too.
Now you will tell us what has been going on.
Nothing!
You know what Santa has been doing.
Now you're going to tell us!
The truth is... the soldiers are leaving and also... that man.
Which man?
The one Santa has been seeing every afternoon.
Don't leave me!
I'll be back
Don't leave me!
It's too expensive! 7.50?
OK, wrap it up.
You look kind of sad, but you're pretty.
If you quarrel with your boyfriend, come and see me!
I know of a good job for you.
Ask for Elvira.
Why are you afraid, beautiful?
I won't hurt you.
Here, take this.
Let's dance and later, we'll have a drink.
I don't want to drink.
I don't know how to dance.
And, if I pay you to get drunk, and take off your clothes?
Do you think I'm a beggar or that anyone can do what they want with me?
You're wrong, no one tells me what to do.
I have a lot of money. Enough to buy you all!
Hey you! Just because you have some money, you think that you can do what you want with us?
Beat it!
That old man is funny!
It's a pity we can't escape this kind of life.
The young flesh is the best.
When did you arrive?
You haven't been here in a long time.
Have you seen my new girl?
Yes, she's angry with me.
And the others treated me worse than a dog.
You know me! I'm leaving!
Let me go, damn it!
That's the one you want?
She's just arrived, she's worth a million!
Yes! No one else!
Come drink with his gentleman
Santa, what a name for a girl in a place like this!
Come close, I know all about self-sacrifice.
A saint in this hell.
You've won the lottery with him.
And order champagne. Champagne!
Champagne for us!
I didn't mean to frighten you, but if you don't like me, you can leave.
I have a lot of money in my wallet, for you... if.
I think I can go now.
No, go with him, at least, he's too drunk. Isn't that right, Hipolito.
I don't know what to tell you Elvira. I don't think this girl is from here.
For now, I belong to this house.
But I don't have the pleasure of knowing you.
I must go, Genarillo must be tired.
Bye Elvira, bye...
Santa, my name is Santa.
Goodbye, Miss Santa.
What a pretty name.
Genarillo, let's go!
You think I'm drunk.
I'll get over it in a minute.
Do you see Santa, the new girl?
Describe her tome.
I don't know, there are so many girls.
Try harder! Is she a brunette?
Are her eyes large?
I don't know which one she is, there are far too many ladies.
D AYS, WEEKS...
SANTA BECOMES LIKE THE OTHER GIRLS IN ELVIRA'S HOUSE.
You're falling in love with Santa?
I love all the girls! All of them!
They are all good girls, even Elvira.
I like it when there are no customers and we're all here together.
You agree, Hipo?
Santa, I'm so happy when you are beside me, and there are no visitors. I don't have to play, and you don't have to dance.
What a good friend you are.
But now I'm sad
Why Santa?
When you talk to me, all my cares disappear... and God...
We shouldn't talk of Him here
That's difficult to resolve.
Like Maria Magdalene.
What Maria Magdalene?
You're cheating!
You too, bitch!
Quiet!
Is there no decency in this house?
Tell me about your life.
It's not that I don't want to. But it'll make both of us sad.
Well, don't then, but tomorrow don't ask me to talk with you.
Well, if you like.
I didn't know my father.
I remember when I was little my mother would sit me on her knees to feed me.
And I suppose... I was clumsy, because... I was little... and blind,
I suppose my mother cried because I felt warm drops running down my face.
Later, when I was six, my mother took me to a Boarding School. She promised she would visit me each week.
But never came back for me
I learned to read with my fingers. And years went by.
I knew my classmates were happy because their mothers came to visit them. But I was always, alone. Building a world of my own, in my imagination.
And that's it, Santa.
I left school when I became older and here I am!
Lets forget those sad times!
Play the song you wrote for me.
I'll play the song I composed the night you arrived.
That's why it's called: "Santa".
During the eternal night. Of my grieving.
You've been the star that brightens my sky.
And I have imagined your beauty.
You've illuminated my darkness
'Santa', oh my 'Santa'!
You've brought a shining light to my life.
'Santa', be my guide down this road of pain.
Remove these thorns.
Erase with kisses all my disappointments.
Brighten my heart with your light...
THE EAS Y LIFE CONTINUED... WITHOUT INTERRUPTION,
WITH THE MONOTONY OF A CLOCK...
Tell me, do you have a boy friend?
And what's it to you?
What is this boy friend stuff?
That... that's Jarameño my men... mentor.
The best To...
Torero that has co... come to Mexico.
And he's in love with Santa. Poor guy!
Quiet! Stop this noise!
I have two sick girls and... Sick!
Beware, beware!
Lets go some place else.
I'll pay!
You're going to take my girls... just like that? Let the party continue!
Come with me!
And you, my love, aren't you coming with us?
Sure, but not with you!
What a temperament.
That Jarameño is tireless.
Say Elvira! Santa is going too?
I want the band to play: "Silenciosamente"
Play: "Silenciosamente".
Don't touch me, the hell with you!
Santa, teach me to dance Danzon.
You have to be very close together, you know First you must do many turns. And in the second part, you must shake your hips.
Play a danzon.
I'll pay!
Danzon dedicated to Santa, the most beautiful woman in Mexico.
Would you honor me with a dance?
We're looking for a woman, who is misnamed Santa.
The lady is inside with her friends.
Would you please tell her we're looking for her?
We're relatives and we need to see her.
Please!
Don't you worry, we won't delay you and make you lose money.
We spent many hours looking for you. In these terrible houses like the one you live in.
Santa. Mother died the night before last.
We buried her in the cemetery. Close to Don Viviano and Angel's daughter.
Mother blessed you and called for you.
Well, we'll go now.
Being your mother, she didn't curse you.
But we do!
Don't ever try to see us again.
Fabian!
Santa, what's the matter?
What did they do to you?
My mother died!
You must be in great pain.
One's mother is the most precious Thing one has in the world. When she dies, one's heart breaks in two.
My poor little girl.
I beg you, even if I have to go on my knees, not to return to Doña Elvira's house.
Move elsewhere and pray for your mother.
Pray to the Virgin of Macarena for your mother's soul.
Hey, Genarillo.
What do you want?
Tell me again. What does Santa look like?
I've told you many times, she's beautiful.
Imagine a statue in a park that you would like to touch.
You've touched her!
No, never!
But she has pushed me around and made fun of me.
Tell me what she looks like, beginning with her hair.
You see her every night and I never will.
Her hair is a color you must know - black!
The color I see if I rub my eyes
She has such dark eyes that if you could see them I would go blind...
In the barren desert that's my life.
I've been sad and without love.
When everything was shadows and darkness like a ghost you came to me.
I decided to be your shadow and heal your wounds.
And make your one-hour lovers leave you so that you could be mine.
That song is dedicated to me. Do you like it?
It's very pretty.
I would like your advice.
You know I respect your opinion.
Jarameño is crazy about me, and he is a famous matador.
He has offered me a house.
I can't advise you.
Do you love him?
He's pleasant enough and he treats me well.
And what do I have to do with it.
I'm blind almost glad of it.
Do you love him, Santa?
The truth is I would like to leave this life.
We... we will have an exiting bu... bullfight.
You're so beautiful.
Take me with you.
This is the first time you will face the bulls since we've been together.
Please don't ask me that!
I get the feeling, that the day you see me in the arena, something terrible will happen to me.
Hey beauty! See how a great matador looks!
Hooray for the gypsy bullfighters!
Come in, Ripol. Thanks!
I came to wish you well now that the moment of truth has arrived.
Look at her, she's more beautiful than the Virgin.
You make me blush!
Madam, I'm a rather seedy gentleman, but still a gentleman.
And a good friend.
I came to this country with a marvelous invention.
But now I can barely survive without begging asking for a loan.
And in... injuring you, more than a bull.
Who the hell are you?
You're just a servant.
I may be a servant, but I earn my living. I...
I'm no parasite!
The car is here, it's 2:30.
Pray for me!
I'll go get my girl.
Good luck.
Thanks, buddy.
You have some spare change?
I'll give it to you after the fight. Right now I'm very worried.
Marcelino!
You!
I saw you by accident.
I came to tell you that I never abandoned you.
I know all about your life.
You were thrown out of the army for cowardice.
A man like you cannot be a soldier.
You judge me harshly.
I came for you so that we can be together again. Forever, in my parents'house.
It's as I told you Santa.
I searched for your family.
I tried to remake my life.
And I wanted to know where you were.
In Elvira's house!
That's where I ended up, and... No!
Don't say that, we'll marry.
Marry?
I've found only two decent men in my life.
A blind man and the 'torero' you saw.
You and all the others are despicable.
Don't be like that.
I speak the truth.
- THE BULLFIGHT IS CANCELLED -
What kind of joke is this?
We don't know, either they fear you or the promoter doesn't want to pay taxes.
To hell with it! I've had enough.
Let's go home, dammit!
Have faith in me!
Leave me alone.
O.K. But don't get ma... mad.
Let Santa console you, gypsy king.
The almighty Virgin has saved you!
Leave the house or I'll be lost!
Go away!
Don't cry!
Leave me alone with her.
Santa I need to speak with you.
We've known each other for a long time. It pains me to tell you this.
Yes, I know, you're throwing me out.
Not precisely!
You know that after you returned to my house, after you broke up with Jarameño, that I've always been good to you
You're very sick, you're pale.
And what do you want me to do?
Go to a hospital and get well. Everyone knows you're sick.
And that's bad for business!
I'm here to do you a favour.
Now I'll leave because there are plenty of other places I can go to.
See if any of your girls can match me.
I'm not hurt by your remarks.
Go, get cured! And then, come back, we'll talk again. I don't want sick girls in my house.
That's enough!
Hipo. Santa is leaving.
Why?
Santa, may I speak with you?
Yes, come, sit down!
What do you want?
I heard that you are leaving, That you're ill.
Listen, I don't know how to tell you.
I can't find the words. I love you very much, even against my will.
You have no idea how much I love you.
You may think I'm a monster.
But inside, I'm not that ugly.
Come to my house.
I know you love me, you've proven it a thousand times.
The truth is that I'm not in love with you.
That is all right.
Perhaps some day.
THUS, IN A STEEP DECLINE, SHE HIT BOTTOM...
Listen, Loreto! You are useless to me. I don't know how you're going to do it.
But you have to leave by tomorrow. You don't have to pay the money you owe me.
And you can resume using the name you had when you came here...
OK, but I'll leave today
Just lend me fifty cents, so that I can call a friend.
He'll pay you back.
As soon as he arrives, out you go!
Hipo, you are here?
No one wants me anymore.
I'm sick and dying.
I'll take you to my house.
And you're not going to die, you can't die.
How nice everything is, Hipo.
Such a big house.
I can offer you very little. But everything is yours, we are your servants.
Go get some food.
Santa, we will do what you want here you will get well.
And no one will bother you.
Do you really love me that much?
You know that my beauty has vanished, don't you find me repugnant?
Listen to me!
I don't even know how much I love you.
First you must get well, those terrible pains must disappear.
Tomorrow I'll get a doctor and another and another if necessary, until you are well.
Well, doctor?
She has an incurable cancer.
We can try to extend her life with surgery.
It's risky and expensive.
It would probably be more than you can afford.
Look, this is all I have, all my savings.
I don't know how much it is. Take it!
And if it's not enough, I'll work day and night
I would steal, if necessary, to pay you.
You don't have to pay me right now, calm down!
We'll operate the day after tomorrow.
Is it a dangerous operation?
Dangerous yes, life-threatening, no.
Poor man!
Hipo, what are you doing?
There must be something in my eye.
I'm dying, right?
I feel terrible.
My body is racked with pain.
You'll have an operation in two days.
You're not going to die.
That's why they're doing the surgery.
Swear to me, that you'll bury me in my village next to my mother.
No, don't interrupt me!
Swear it!
Don't leave me!
It's Santa? Who's coming?
Yes, she was one of the most beautiful women in Mexico.
It's going to be a very difficult surgery.
Poor girl!
Everything is ready!
Hurry up or we'll be late.
The time has come.
Do you think Santa will die?
Why would she die?
She's such a good person
Here's Santa.
I thought you were late.
Santa, have faith!
Good bye, Hipo
She not breathing!
She's dead.
Hipo, be strong!
Unfortunately, Santa died.
No!
Science could not help her.
Be strong, my friend.
Poor Santa!
Don't cry.
We're alone again, alone in this life!
Santa!
Mother of God, pray for us sinners...
Come on, Oscar.
What are we waiting for?
- What's the matter? Can't you find it?
- Sneak up on it, boy.
- Oscar, come on.
- Say, if it had lipstick on it, he'd find it.
Almonds to you.
Almonds.
Not almonds.
I have to spend half my life waiting for these time clocks to open.
Say, where's Matt?
Probably upstairs thinking up that daily joke.
That guy kills me with his wisecracks.
Say, when he comes in, let's put on frozen faces.
Let's smile.
How you doing, slaves?
- How are you, Matt?
Did you fellows ever hear the story of the pawnbroker with the glass eye?
What is the story about the pawnbroker with his glass eye?
Well, I'll tell you.
A fellow went into this shop to pawn his watch.
The pawnbroker said, "I'll give you $50 for it
"if you can tell me which is my glass eye."
The fellow says, "All right,
"I'll do that.
"It's the right one."
The pawnbroker says, "That's correct.
"How did you know it was the right one?"
The fellow says, "Well, it's got more sympathy than the other."
Sympathy.
You know, the right one had more sympathy than the other.
Can't you get this thing open?
Six reasons why banks fail.
I love your jokes, Matt.
So entertaining.
Let me get to the point of this story.
- Very funny man.
- Great audience, you guys.
Come on, white collars.
The day's started.
You're carrying too much money, Hank.
Better turn some in tonight.
- Okay, Matt.
- How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
- You got enough?
Matt, I'll need some money for those Manville payrolls.
- About $24,000.
It was more than that last week.
Well, here's $25,000.
Say, do me a favour, will you, Charlie?
- Let me have $10.
Say, if I had $10, I'd quit.
I'll pay you back on Saturday.
On the level, I will.
Now, give me $10, will you?
I got to get it back in my account.
If Helen finds out...
Baby, I can't give you anything but love.
Listen, Charlie, I'll give you an IOU.
I'll give you a note, a mortgage...
Whose death?
I'll be yours if you don't kick in with that $10.
Say, pal, did you ever hear of a depression?
Nerts!
Come over and see us sometime.
I'm not asking you to pay off the French war debt.
I'm only asking you for $10.
That mug reminds me of the guy with his second dollar.
What did he do with his first one?
He bought himself a pocketbook.
- Matt, come here.
Somebody's liable to see us.
Five ill winds.
And blowing no good for the old man, either.
The four-and-a-half horsemen.
There's no board meeting today.
- Mr Dickson in yet?
- Not yet, Mr Clark.
Tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
- And tell him not to delay.
Looks like trouble for your boss.
Takes more than two tons of directors to make trouble for my boss.
I've sent for the cashier, gentlemen.
He has a list of the loans that Dickson made last month.
As I told you, it's time we did something about it.
Mr Clark's right.
Dickson will ruin this bank if we don't stop him.
Looks to me like we're in hot water already.
Gentlemen, I was just wondering...
I think you're panic-stricken about nothing.
- Dickson's all right.
We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city.
- We're fools to tolerate it.
- That's what I say.
And the only way to end it is to get Dickson out.
- Dickson doesn't have to go, but he must agree to this merger with the New York Trust.
What good will that do?
I'll take control away from him.
We'll put someone else in charge, call in all doubtful loans and be on safe ground again.
- It just occurred to me...
Dickson will never stand for it.
He will if I have anything to say about it.
- Come in, Cluett.
- Here's the list.
No, nothing.
Look at this. Just look at this.
Henry Moore: $36,000.
Manny Goldberg: $8,500.
Tony Consero: $55,000.
Joseph McDonald: $18,000.
Alvin Jones: $66,000 to a hotel that's on its last legs.
People can get loans here who couldn't borrow 5 cents anywhere else.
And on what? "Hunches," he calls it.
Someday he'll get a hunch and give the bank away.
He's almost done that already.
Matt Brown is an example of that.
Breaks into Dickson's house, holds him up, and next day has a job here.
A boy who should be in jail, handling the bank's cash.
- The $10.
- Ten dollars.
A friend of mine...
Yeah, really, his mother was terribly sick
- and she was dying, would you believe it?
Don't forget you called me a liar.
Honey, why don't we get married?
Then you can handle it all.
- Say, Matt, did you hear the news?
Well, pardon me.
All the big shots are in a huddle.
It looks like Dickson's out on his ear.
- Everyone knows. Ask her.
- I haven't heard about it.
If that's on the level, there goes my assistant cashier's job.
I just thought I'd drop by and cheer you up a bit.
I'll be seeing you, Matt, in the bread line.
That ham I had this morning...
Gentlemen, let's get organised before Dickson gets here.
- Schultz, can I count on you? - Absolutely.
- What about you, Ames?
- That's how I feel about it.
Ives, how about you?
- Well, the way I look at it...
You've got an awful fight on your hands.
Gentlemen, I think that it's time that we do fight.
- Hello, Gardiner.
You're on time this morning.
- Good morning, Mr Dickson.
- John, how's your wife this morning?
- Much better this morning, thank you.
- Got a handkerchief?
How do you feel this morning?
- I'm feeling fine this morning.
- That makes it unanimous.
- I feel all right, too.
You know the rules about smoking.
- You here again?
The same as anybody wants from you, money.
- I told you I wasn't interested in that deal.
- But I want to know why.
- You haven't got a uniform?
You gotta have a uniform.
How much does one cost?
Tell Mr Sampson I sent you.
Gotta have a uniform.
I never had trouble borrowing from you before.
When I was broke, you gave me all I wanted.
- Now I come to you with a swell deal...
- I don't like your crowd.
You can have all the credit you want.
For that deal, not a cent.
- But listen...
- Good morning, Mrs Pembroke.
- Get my letter?
You're becoming more beautiful every day.
What do we do about it?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank, that's all.
When are you and Matt going to get married?
- Stalling, eh?
The directors are waiting for you in the boardroom.
Directors?
Long faces?
Longer.
And I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
- Mr Dickson.
- Mrs Pembroke.
I spoke to Mr Schaffer at the Guaranty.
He'll take care of your mortgage.
Mrs Dickson's on the phone.
You'd better hurry over there.
Hello, dear. Yeah.
Come on down, right away.
Yes, of course I remember.
See what a social hound I'm becoming?
But, Mr Dickson, I thought you were taking care of the mortgage.
I only want $10,000, the property is worth $60,000.
Mr Schaffer will take care of you.
He'll give you $15,000 or $20,000.
Better hurry now.
Good luck to you.
If Mrs Dickson comes in, tell her to see Cluett if she needs any money.
What's the idea of turning her down?
Sounded like a safe investment.
I don't like to take mortgages from widows.
- lf she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose.
- Yeah, sure.
"Yeah, sure."
Make that uniform blue.
Seven more and you'd have a jury.
Well, it's a nice morning, gentlemen.
How about two foursomes of golf, huh?
I say, that...
You know I found out something about hitting a golf ball.
Hit it with the left hand, and from the inside out.
- It's the only way...
- We'd like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
If it's more important than golf, go ahead.
- The cheque is no good.
The cheque is no good.
The man has no account here.
- Holy mackerel!
I've been robbed.
- I'm sorry, madam.
So am I. And don't call me madam.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
- Is it safe?
- It's his life insurance money.
You come with me and I'll show you where to deposit your money.
- Who do you want to see?
Yeah, we want to talk to you about a big deal.
Well, come right this way.
Hey, Pat, come here.
That's Dude Finlay.
- I wonder what he's doing with Mr Cluett.
He's one of the toughest gangsters in town.
Gentlemen, you're only wasting your time.
There'll be no merger.
Why should I turn this bank over to anybody else?
I've worked 25 years to build it up and now you ask me to dump it into somebody's lap.
You could make a handsome profit on your stock.
I'm not interested in profits.
I'm interested in the bank.
The depositors are my friends.
They need my protection.
I won't walk out on them.
How are you protecting your depositors?
By making a lot of idiotic loans?
Take it easy, Clark.
- My dear friends... - It's all right.
Let him speak his piece.
All right, I'll speak my piece.
Dickson, you've got to change your policy.
What's the matter with my policy?
How many losses has this bank taken in the last 25 years?
I'll tell you, not a single one.
- What's wrong with that kind of banking?
- Pure luck.
Conditions have changed.
These are precarious times.
Banks today have got to be careful.
And you've been more liberal than ever.
Yes, and I'll continue to be liberal.
The trouble with this country is there's too much hoarded cash.
Idle money is no good to industry.
Where's all the money today?
In the banks, vaults, socks, old tin cans buried in the ground.
We've got to get the money in circulation before you'll get this country back to prosperity.
Who are we going to give it to?
Men like Jones?
Last week you made him an extra loan of $50,000.
Is that intelligent banking?
Can't pay his bills.
How do you expect him to pay us?
That's a fair question, Schultz.
Let's see how bad a risk Jones is.
What's his history?
He's been a successful businessman for 35 years.
Two years ago, business started falling off.
Today, Jones needs money.
And if he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy and throws 900 men out of work.
Answer: unemployment.
It also means his creditors aren't paid.
They're in trouble.
They go to the banks and are turned down.
More bankruptcies.
It's a vicious circle, my friends, and the only place to cure it is right here at the source.
Help Jones and you help the whole circle.
When Jones comes to me, I ask myself two questions, first, is he honest?
Second, is he as good a businessman as he was before?
And the answer is, he's better.
He is not only older and wiser but his present trouble has taught him precaution.
In my estimation, gentlemen, Jones is no risk.
Neither are the thousands of other Joneses across the country.
It's they who made this nation the richest in the world and it's up to the banks to give them a break.
Disraeli said, "Security is the prosperity of a nation."
Disraeli didn't say anything of the kind.
It's as true now as it was then.
But let's get the right kind of security.
Not stocks and bonds that zigzag up and down.
Not collateral on paper, but character.
Character.
That's your idea.
It's Alexander Hamilton's idea.
The finest banking mind of this country.
Those were his exact words, gentlemen,
"Character is the only thing you can bank on
"and it's the only thing that'll pull this country out of the doldrums."
You know what we do to weichers, Cluett, don't you?
I know, Dude.
I must have been crazy.
I lost my head completely.
That's your funeral.
We've got $50,000 coming to us.
- Then what did you want to gamble for?
If you'd have beat us out of $50,000, you'd have been paid.
Well, we want our dough.
- I'm sorry, Dude, but I...
- That don't do us any good.
After all, you can't take blood from a stone.
We can take blood from anything if it's coming to us.
Perhaps if you'll wait a little while
- I might be able...
- We've waited long enough.
Lay off.
What's the use of getting excited, Cluett?
It ought to be easy for you to lay your mitts on that kind of dough.
There's plenty of it in this bank laying around loose.
Good Heavens, man!
- You're not suggesting that I...
- I couldn't do that.
- You don't have to do nothing.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us and we'll do the rest, see?
I couldn't do anything like it.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting?
That means hours, I suppose.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Take my word for it, and don't try it.
It's useless.
If it were another woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out, now, can you?
Hardly.
Oh, well, I guess the only other thing for me to do is go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite.
When he comes out, tell him I'll be back.
He hasn't gotten rid of me.
Dude, there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
No, you'll be all right so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
- Be sure to be with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked.
But, Dude, listen.
Couldn't we make this some other time?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy.
Quit squawking.
Not during business hours.
I needed a...
Do you mind putting up with me until the financial genius gets through geniusing?
Of course not, not at all.
Here.
Why, what is the matter with you?
Why, I don't know any reason why I should be,
- unless, of course, it's you.
Being alone with you has always done this to me.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission.
Besides, I didn't know that any female could do this to you.
You always could.
You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
Here, now.
Now, don't you go to work on me, too.
Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks.
The running around.
Not the work.
You better start reforming, Cyril.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Do you know something?
- I've always been curious about your line.
- Line?
Or whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Try a little of it out on me.
I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
But, you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
What comes next?
"What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?"
- Doesn't that come next?
What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
See, we're getting along famously.
Most of the depositors I know personally.
I've seen them grow up.
I knew their parents before them.
I know, that's all very well, but you're taking too many chances.
In these times, a bank should keep liquid in case of emergency.
You want me to hang on to our cash.
I don't believe in it.
The law demands that I carry a certain legal reserve, and I do.
The rest of our money is out working, to help industry and business.
Meanwhile, you're jeopardizing the safety of the bank.
Well, we won't stand for it.
You'll have to stand for it.
But my dear friends...
You're forcing us to take action against you.
Go ahead, take all the action you want.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Gentlemen, you'll notice that Mr Dickson refuses to consider our wishes.
He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust, the only thing that'll put this bank on safe ground.
He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as faith.
You said it.
That's the only thing that means anything to me.
Before I take a man into this bank and extend credit to anyone, I satisfy myself on one thing, do I believe in him?
So far, my judgement has been right, 100%.
When I start going wrong, you won't have to take any action.
I'll turn the bank over to you, and then you can merge all you want to.
I won't be the fellow to run it then.
- Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
And after dinner we could go...
No, I think I've done enough experimenting for one day.
Congratulations, Cyril.
You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order.
- I shall recommend you highly.
- Please don't laugh at me, Phyllis.
- I must see you tonight. - Tonight?
Never.
Tonight I have reserved for a very special occasion.
Believe it or not, it's our wedding anniversary.
Tom doesn't probably even remember it.
But then, they never do, do they?
- But I've planned a party for him, a real old-fashioned surprise party:
caps, bells, whistles, and everything.
I'm really terribly excited about it.
I've been planning it for months.
- Well, aren't you going to invite me?
It's all set.
Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't be silly, Cyril.
These are respectable people.
- They'd probably bore you to death.
- No, they won't, not when you're there.
Please, come on, be a sport.
Please ask me.
- Why are you so anxious?
- Don't you know?
- I want to be near you.
- I've been crazy about you for years.
I've always loved you, long before you married Tom.
- Why, Cyril, you're insane.
I deliberately avoided you.
I was afraid of making a fool of myself.
But I won't stand it any longer.
Please forgive me, Phyllis.
I lost my head for a moment, but I couldn't help it.
Please stop apologising.
You're making it far too important.
Hi, Matt.
Mr Dickson wants to see you right away.
I heard the merger isn't going through.
Isn't that grand?
Yeah, swell.
Well, Matt, get ready for the big moment.
Starting tomorrow, you become assistant cashier.
What's more, keep up the good work, and who knows, someday you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk.
Not a bad thought, eh?
You don't seem very excited about it.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Come on, show a little enthusiasm.
You sick or something?
Go on, fake it, even if it isn't real.
I'm sorry, Mr Dickson.
It's just kind of sudden, that's all.
Sure, I'm excited.
You've done so much for me already, I'll never be able to thank you enough.
You came through, didn't you?
Lot of them didn't think you would.
You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me.
When are you and Helen going to get married?
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you, too?
Well, if this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson.
First I trample on the board of directors, then I promote Matt to assistant cashier, and to complete the day, I've a visit from my sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife.
What a man!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
That has the earmarks...
Are you still here?
Go on, go to work.
What do you think I pay you for?
Did you get the job?
What's the matter, Matt?
I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
A few minutes ago I was in Clue's office, and Mrs Dickson was there.
- He was making love to her.
- Matt, you must be mistaken.
- I tell you, I saw them.
- In Clue's office?
- Yes, right in his office, the rat.
I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Don't go away.
Yeah, sure.
That's for tonight?
Yes, certainly I'll be there.
We'll go down together and have dinner in Philadelphia.
Just as soon as the bank closes.
I'm going to Philadelphia when the bank closes.
- Make all the arrangements, will you?
What's the matter, dear?
I thought you were going out with me tonight.
I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
You simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight, that's all there is to it.
- I've got to go.
It's an important...
- I don't care if it's important or not.
You said you were going out with me.
If you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have planned the whole thing.
It's not so terribly important.
We can go to the theatre anytime.
- The theatre?
- That's what was your plan, wasn't it?
You can take some of the girls.
Take Mildred, or Gwen.
The girls.
Did it ever occur to you I might go out and find myself an attractive young man?
"Ho, ho, ho," yourself.
I wouldn't laugh if I were you.
You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive to some.
Now, listen, don't you go around being attractive to anybody but me.
Don't you forget that I'm still the headman around here, too.
We're gonna change those tickets for tomorrow night.
And you and I are going out together.
- Mr Gardiner's here.
That's that lawyer.
Let him have $9,000.
I'll step you around this town like you've never been stepped before.
We'll have dinner at the St Regis, go to a nice snappy show, then to a nightclub, sit and listen to the soft music, and who knows?
I might break down and dance with you.
And I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Are you happy now?
Poor kid, you have been neglected, haven't you?
I don't care, darling.
I love you anyway.
- Mr Sampson.
- Sampson, what is it?
- Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
I'll take this with me.
Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow.
- I'm sick and tired of this delay.
- I'm afraid he's been stalling.
This deal should have been closed weeks ago.
- Tell him to keep tomorrow open.
- He says he can't in the daytime.
How about his nights?
Too busy running around?
Tell him to come sign this thing tomorrow night, or this whole deal is off.
I'm sick of these people dilly-dallying.
Can't make up their minds.
- Everybody in?
- Charlie's upstairs, sore as a pup.
He's out 14 cents and he can't find it.
What's keeping you?
Charlie again.
Say, Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Cluett?
But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff-necked horse collar.
Can you imagine that guy?
He was kissing her.
You've got me worried, dear.
- Promise me you won't butt in.
But just the same, I'd like to take a crack at that...
- I'll wait for you upstairs.
- All right, dear.
Where do you think I've been?
I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
What's the matter, Charlie?
I'm 14 cents out and it took me half an hour to find the mistake.
And me with a date, too.
Ah, once when your accounts checked.
Listen, wise guy, I'm setting friend time clock for exactly 9:00 so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Say, don't annoy me.
I got troubles of my own.
- Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Let me see your cashbook, will you?
Seems to me you're carrying too much cash.
- Have you the correct time?
- 12:05.
- What's this?
I knew I couldn't trust you.
- You told me you were taking me home.
- Come on up for just a few minutes.
- We'll have just one drink and then we'll go.
- I know the answer to that one.
I think you'd better take me home.
Afraid papa will spank?
No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested.
He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy old speeches at stuffy old bankers' meetings.
Too busy closing big, important...
- I think I will have a drink. - Good for you.
Come on.
There ought to be a Congressional medal for men like you.
America's comfort to misunderstood wives.
I never thought I'd find myself in that crowd.
You're not so badly off.
There's something worse than being a misunderstood wife.
- What is that, Mr Bones?
- A misunderstood bachelor.
And now, fair woman, I have you in my power.
You haven't got a moustache.
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Why, Matt.
Well, the butler said I could stay.
I told him it was important.
He left at 9:00. He said you gave him the night off.
I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
It's funny, now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.
You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
Do you mind stepping outside?
We can...
Anything you have to say, say it in the morning.
Oh, no, Mr Cluett.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait.
It's about you and Mrs Dickson.
- About me...
- Why, Matt, what are you talking about?
I know I got a lot of nerve butting in, but I couldn't help it.
I wanted to stop you from doing something you'd be sorry for.
I'm not interested in what you think.
You've no right to do it to him.
Why don't you think it over?
- It'll only get you in trouble.
- I'm not interested in your opinion.
Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs Dickson.
Nobody knows it better than you.
- lf he ever found out, i'd kill him.
- You're mistaken about the whole thing.
There isn't anything wrong.
- Mr Cluett and I simply...
- Phyllis, you don't have to explain.
- You mind your own business.
- This is my business.
Mr Dickson's like a father to me.
What's he ever done to you to deserve this?
That'll be just about enough. Now, you get out of here.
Well, I guess I have said enough.
- I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
- You're right for the first time.
Now, get out.
I'm appealing to you, Mrs Dickson.
Think what you're doing to him.
You're passing up the whitest man on earth for a dirty, no-good...
Wait a minute, Matt.
But you needn't go on account of this idiot.
You better carry that around with you all the time.
- What do you say, Doc?
- I'd say about eight or nine hours.
Well, you'd better call the coroner.
Say, fellas, I was the first one to see him.
I was coming down the steps and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
You coulïve knocked me over with a pin.
Do you see that clock?
Right there, that's where the bullet hit it.
Well, when I saw that, you coulïve knocked me over with a pin.
- Was there much blood?
- Blood?
- Come on over, fellows, I'll show you.
I don't want nothing touched down here till we get through.
- Oscar, what's the matter?
- Say, listen, I was the first one to see it.
- No kidding.
He'll have a tough time thinking up a wisecrack for this one.
The detective's got Matt upstairs in Sampson's office.
- Say, did Matt do it?
- Don't look at me, I don't know.
He was acting kind of funny yesterday, didn't you notice?
- I noticed it, too.
Come on, tell the truth.
What'd you do with the money?
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at 12:00 and emptied the boxes.
- I wasn't anywhere near here!
When the watchman surprised you, you shot him.
- But you used to carry one.
Pardon me, but I'd like to use my office for a while.
You use some other office.
- Gonna open today?
Come on, open this door.
- Shall we let the people come in?
- Of course, let them in.
You're late now.
Open the rest of the doors.
Mr Dickson, they're going to arrest Matt.
They think he did it.
- In Mr Sampson's office.
- Then you did it alone!
- What's the matter? What's going on here?
You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
- I'm afraid I must, Mr Dickson.
- Why pick on him?
It's an inside job, that's a cinch.
Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout.
- Brown is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
The burglar alarm was turned off.
The time clock was set for 12:00.
- What more do you want?
- Somebody else coulïve done it.
- He admits setting it himself.
- I did, for 9:00 this morning.
- Then who changed it?
Wait a minute. What time did you say this thing happened?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
- lf he can do it, yes.
- He certainly can.
Matt, all you got to do is tell them where you were last night between 12:00 and 12:30 and everything will be all right.
I already told him, I was home.
- There you are.
- That's what he says.
I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
As soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.
Listen, don't talk so loud.
Coast a little.
What do you think?
There was that poor watchman lying on the floor right in front of me.
Dead? - Dead.
He was lifeless.
You know, I was the first one to see him.
I was coming down the steps, and there was the watchman lying on the floor right in front of me, dead.
You coulïve knocked me over...
Yeah, I coulïve knocked you over with a pin.
Yeah, you coulïve knocked...
- Hello, Mayme, this is Gerda again.
- Almonds to you.
Say, listen, I just heard something that'll make your head swim.
Listen to this, the bank was robbed last night.
Yeah, over $100,000.
I don't know who did it, but the chief teller's in an awful jam.
Call me up later.
I'm going to call up Lou now.
Hello, Lou?
Did you hear what happened over at the Union National Bank?
Wait a minute, Lou.
Yes, sir, I'm trying to get them.
Yes, Lou, listen.
It was robbed of over $200,000.
Can you beat that?
- Stole over $250,000. Can you beat that?
- You can't laugh that off.
I thought the Union National was pretty solid.
But $500,000 is a lot of money.
I wouldn't be surprised if they had to close their doors.
Oh, good gracious.
- Sammy, are you sure about that?
The messenger boy just told me, that Mr Dickson took all the money himself.
And it was more than a million dollars.
- More than a million dollars?
- Cross my heart.
And I sure hopes that man gets a long time in jail, too.
Never mind my shoes, Sam.
I always said the Union National was a phoney bank.
Union National?
- You had money in that bank, too? - Yes.
Something wrong?
Run, run.
- You're telling me!
- You are a poor man.
I got it from the best authority.
Dickson got away with several million.
That's the end of the Union National Bank.
That's the trouble nowadays.
You don't know who to trust.
Is there something wrong with Union National Bank?
Brother, that ain't the half of it.
If you have money in there, kiss it goodbye.
- No, you're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
Holy smoke.
Got any friends?
You better call them up, too.
That's a good idea.
I have friends of my own.
- Can you imagine that?
- What bank did you say that was?
Union National Bank.
They're broke.
Haven't got a dime.
Jack, go to the Union National Bank and take your money out.
Don't ask me how I know.
I tell you it's on the rocks.
You'd better tell your friends, too.
Better give your men some time off to get their money out.
Tell Mrs Hardy to tell everyone in the apartment house.
All right. I'll get it or bust a few noses.
I'll get right down there if I have to fly.
Run down there and get your money at once.
Hello, dear.
Have you heard the news?
Please hurry.
Just now.
Union National is sunk.
We should have put it in the vault.
Call the Kincaids and tell them about it.
I don't know what's wrong.
I wouldn't trust anybody.
Everybody's taking their money out.
Union National's broke.
Holy John Judas Priest.
Our money's all gone.
It hasn't a chance.
Okay, honey, I'll go right down.
You better hurry up, too.
If you don't hurry...
Don't lose a moment.
What'll we do?
I'm going right down.
Why take any chances?
Mother just told me.
I just heard it.
Bank's broke.
Hurry up.
- Closing your account? - Yes, sir.
I'm closing it.
I wouldn't leave a nickel in this bank.
It's getting so a guy's money ain't safe unless it's in his sock.
- They're a bunch of crooks.
- You said it.
Say, did I know the bank was gonna go mechuleh?
What am I, a fortune teller?
Oh, my goodness!
- What's the matter, lady?
- Oh, mister, I gotta.
- Well, they only sign slips here.
- Give me your pen, please.
Could you loan me that pen of yours?
I'm in an awful hurry.
I'll need some more money.
All the depositors are withdrawing.
I'll get you some.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed.
The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
He didn't have any more to do with it than you did.
Maybe.
But I'm taking no chances.
- Kiïs got a record.
- So have you, so have I, so has everybody.
What difference does that make?
You can't pin crimes on people just because...
- Mr Dickson, can I see you for a minute?
- No, I'm busy.
But it's important.
Looks like there's a run on the bank.
- What, a run?
- The lobby's half-filled now.
What are you talking about?
Look.
They've been coming in all morning.
I've called for extra police.
Send down to the vaults. Have our reserve cash sent up.
We haven't much on hand.
I hope we don't have to close.
Our reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel.
It's just a flurry. They've heard about the robbery and panicked.
Have our available securities turned into cash.
Wait.
Have my personal stuff turned into cash, too.
Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired.
- We want to talk to you.
- About?
We'll discuss that in the boardroom.
We got a check on Brown's alibi.
You want to hear it?
All right.
Be with you in a minute, Clark.
No need to worry, son.
All you got to do is answer their questions, that's all.
- So you were home last night?
What time did you get there?
About 11:00.
- 11:00?
Are you sure of that?
All right, Kelly.
Do you know this young man, Mrs Halligan?
Sure I do.
He has the best room in me house, the one with the fancy wallpaper.
Did you happen to be awake when he came in last night?
Yes, sir.
I was having me hot mustard bath.
- What time was it?
- For the rheumatism, you know.
- What time was it, Mrs Halligan?
- It was late, I know.
The Dooley sisters was already in.
They work at the show, you know.
What time was it?
- What time did Matt Brown get in?
- Now let me see.
Half an hour after the Dooley sisters, and the Dooley sisters...
I don't care about them.
What time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir.
- It was half an hour after the Dooley sisters.
- Was it 12:00?
- No, it wasn't 12:00 'cause the Dooley...
- Was it 1:00?
- Yes, I guess it was 1:00, 'cause...
- It couldn't have been earlier?
- No, it wasn't earlier because...
- Yes, I know.
Because the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
No, 'cause me clock struck 4:00 and when it strikes 4:00, it's 1:00.
- There you are.
- She doesn't know what she's saying.
Who don't know?
Listen here, young man, nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it.
That's all, Mrs Halligan.
For two nickels I'd knock his block off.
I never told a lie in me life.
- Is this true, Matt?
- Of course it's true, and he knows it.
If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you.
Where were you last night?
She was right.
I didn't get in till after 1:00.
But I wasn't here, Mr Dickson, honest.
- Then where were you?
- Wait.
You realise you're being charged with murder.
It's serious, son.
Come on, I know you didn't do it, but you got to make them believe it.
Come on, tell me the truth.
I can't tell you.
Listen, if I get them out of the room, will you tell me?
No, I won't.
- You're protecting somebody. - No, I'm not.
It doesn't matter who it is.
It can't be as important as this.
Now, tell me.
Come on, don't be a fool.
Matt, you trust me, don't you?
What a day, Mayme.
Everybody's coming in to draw their money out.
Gee, Mayme, I wonder what started it.
Where's our protection?
That's what I want to know.
How do we know who we're giving our money to?
We're a lot of suckers, that's what we are.
- Outrageous. Positively outrageous.
- It's worse than that, lady.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
But the policeman told me it was all right.
- I hope so.
- So do I.
Come on, what are you fellows gaping at?
Come on, go to work.
Go on, hurry up.
Pay these people their money. What's the matter?
Can't you see this line waiting?
Go ahead.
Hurry up.
All right, don't argue with him.
Give it to him.
Go on, it's all right.
It's enough, too.
- You have enough money here?
- I don't know, sir.
Sure, you're fine, you've got plenty.
- Whose window is this?
- Mat's.
Oscar, come here, take this one.
Bring up some money here.
Come on, folks.
Stand in line here.
- Where were you?
- Checking up on this account.
Never mind that.
Go on. Pay them what they want.
Hurry up. Snap into it.
Look at them, Mr Dickson.
They're going crazy.
Did you cash the securities?
Mine, too?
Yes, but when the cash runs out, they'll mob us.
The fools, they're making it worse for themselves.
Somebody starts a rumour and they lose their heads.
- What'll we do?
- I'll talk to them.
Tell the boys to stall as much as possible and to forget what I said.
Tell them to verify every signature.
Take your time, folks.
Don't get excited.
Everybody stay in line.
You'll all be taken care of.
Don't worry about anything.
Where's my money?
Now, listen, everybody.
Listen to me.
Your money is safe.
This bank is in excellent condition.
If you've heard any report to the contrary, it's based on malicious rumour.
Yeah, maybe.
That's a lot of hooey.
- You'll get your money.
- We want it now.
We don't want speeches.
Listen to me, now.
It takes time.
I've got seven paying tellers working just as fast as they can.
If you'll all calm down, I'll make arrangements to keep the doors open till 4:00 and you'll all be paid today.
We can't keep open until 4:00.
We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
- Don't you think I know it?
- They're still waiting for you.
Gentlemen, we got one more hour to go.
That means we'll be forced to shut the doors.
I've worked 25 years, night and day, to keep this bank alive.
You made money out of it.
Will you help?
What do you mean?
Among you, you have a million dollars in city banks.
Get that money here and I'll stop this run in five minutes.
Sounds simple, but why should we jeopardize our fortunes?
I have everything I own in it.
- It's your bank as well, isn't it?
- Since when?
The way you've ignored us, you wouldn't think so.
You wouldn't listen to us.
Your depositors were the first ones to pounce on you.
If they're your friends, why don't you get them to help?
They've gone crazy.
You can't reason with a mob.
You can't reason with anyone when you're in a jam.
We urged you to keep liquid but you didn't.
You preached about faith and other rubbish.
Now you want help.
You want us to throw cash into a bank you will break.
There's one way you can get it, option your stock to us and resign.
So that's it?
You've waited long for this, haven't you?
Well, I won't resign, now or ever.
- You have no choice. - No?
I'll shut the bank first.
- You can't do that. - I can't? Wait and see.
If that run isn't over very soon, I'll shut the doors.
That means the bank examiners will step in tomorrow.
We'll be forced to liquidate.
I'll insist on it.
The depositors will be paid 100 cents on the dollar.
You can have whatever's left but there won't be enough left to pay your next month's garage bill.
- Mr Dickson!
- Get all the big bills in the place.
Get them changed. Get only ones and fives.
Give them to the tellers.
Tell them to take their time.
Stall. Count and re-count the money.
I hate to do this, but I need time to get help.
I know where I can get real cash.
Snap into it, Sampson.
We'll lick this thing yet.
Bring your book.
I want some numbers.
Get Parker at the Union, Read at the Exchange,
Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage.
- Snap into it, Helen, quick as you can.
- Yes, sir.
Look at the mob.
They're going crazy.
This run isn't doing the reputation of this bank any good.
My dear friends...
How much longer is this Dickson going to hold out?
You know Dickson.
He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Let him.
I'm sick and tired of hearing about him.
Let him run the bank.
I don't want any part of it.
- My dear friends...
- Shut up!
Stall!
Is this your signature?
Certainly it's my signature.
You've seen it often enough.
I'm sorry, but I'll have to verify it.
Hello, Parker.
Listen.
I need $1 million in cash, and I've got to have it quick.
No, tomorrow is no good.
I need it now.
Of course it's safe.
The bank's in excellent condition.
You know that.
- Chief's car outside? - Yes, sir.
Okay.
Come on, son.
My love.
Don't cry, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Sorry, sister.
What'd you find out, Mike?
I tailed the cashier like you told me.
There's something screwy.
Never mind all that.
What did you find out?
He left here an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
- Dude Finlay's?
- Yes, sir.
He stayed about half an hour, and then came right back here.
He's in his office now.
That's when I must have seen that guy.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Yes, why?
Why, he was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
He came to see Mr Cluett.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
Who was with him?
Two other men.
They all went in Mr Cluet's office.
Now we're beginning to get somewhere.
Kelly, you stay here with Brown.
Tim, you and Mike come with me.
We're going down to Cluet's office.
Kelly, call me up in Cluet's office in about five minutes.
What'll I say?
I don't care what you say.
Sing Mother Machree if you want to, but call me up.
Quiet down.
Take it easy, folks.
Everything'll be all right.
But you said it was safe.
It's his life insurance money.
Please, I'll go to the old ladies' home if you don't do something.
Take it easy.
Be quiet.
Open up here, folks.
All right, folks, please.
Good heavens, man, you're taking no chances.
No, I'm perfectly willing to sign everything over to you.
What more do you want?
I need action.
I got to have it within the next half-hour.
Yes, sure.
The board of directors turned me down, but you know why.
Listen, Read, it wouldn't mean a drop in the bucket to you.
Ask me for a favour sometime, will you?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr Cluett.
Why, of course, yes.
Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at 12:00 last night?
That's very simple.
I was home.
That is simple, isn't it?
I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Yes, of course.
There was someone with me.
A lady.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all.
What was the lady's name?
If you don't mind, I'd rather not say, unless it becomes absolutely essential.
You see, she's married.
- You understand.
- Why, of course.
Pardon me.
- Yes, he's here.
It's for you, Inspector.
Somebody must be in good humour.
He was humming Mother Machree.
It's one the boys form headquarters.
He always sings Mother Machree whenever he's got good news.
Looks like this case will be settled in no time.
Yeah, Kelly.
Dude Finlay?
Where you got him?
I ain't got nobody here.
I'm with Brown.
Didn't you tell me to call you in five minutes?
Take him right down to headquarters.
You don't mean Cyril Cluett, the cashier?
Yeah?
Did Dude Finlay tell you that?
Sure, I got him here.
For a minute, I didn't catch on.
Yeah.
We got him right here now.
Okay, Kelly.
Good work.
Looks like a...
Get him!
There he goes!
He must be here.
There's only one door.
Find him.
- What's that noise?
- Sounded like a locker.
A locker?
Search every one of them.
He must be in one.
Stand back, Inspector, or I'll shoot you.
Drop that gun.
All right, Jack.
Don't be a fool.
This is only going to make it worse for you.
Stand back, Inspector.
Let me out of here or I'll shoot you.
Let me see it!
It's only his finger.
Get me a towel.
Now, take it easy, buddy.
All we want to do is talk to you.
You can't do a thing?
You're up to your neck?
You were right, Mr Dickson.
Brown didn't have anything to do it.
Here's your man.
You must be crazy.
I've known this man for years.
He's just confessed.
He's mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
Confessed?
Heavens' name!
What's got into you?
It's all been like a crazy nightmare.
You're not a thief.
How did you get mixed up with these people?
Gambling.
I owed them a lot of money.
- Last week I lost over $50,000.
- $50,000.
But I didn't kill that man last night.
Honest I didn't.
Yesterday they came to collect it.
I begged them to wait.
I wanted time to think, but they wouldn't listen.
They threatened to kill me if I didn't pay.
I was desperate.
I didn't know what to do.
Then they suggested I help them rob the bank.
All I had to was turn off the alarm and fix the time clock.
It all sounded so easy.
It seemed like a way out.
I didn't know anybody was going to be killed.
Why were you at Finlay's this morning?
I went to there to get my keys back.
Why didn't you come to me?
I'd have helped you out.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr Dickson.
I didn't know what I was doing.
I wandered around in a daze.
All I could think of was that they were going to kill me.
But you'll stand by me, won't you, Mr Dickson?
You won't go back on me now, will you?
I'll die if they send me to prison.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I was home in my apartment last night, I can prove it.
Claims he was there with a married woman.
Doesn't want to mention her name.
He won't believe me, but it's the truth, honest.
I was in my apartment last night.
Ask your wife.
She...
My wife?
What's she got to do with you?
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
What was my wife doing in your apartment?
Nothing, Mr Dickson.
Don't pay attention to me.
You just mentioned her name.
What was she doing in your apartment?
Well, she just came up for a drink.
- Just for a few...
- You're lying!
Don't worry, Mr Dickson.
We'll find out if he's telling the truth.
We'll have a man check up on it right away.
No one check up on anybody.
I'll do all the checking up.
Wait a minute.
- Helen.
- Sir?
Get Mrs Dickson on the phone.
Listen, dear.
I want to ask you something.
I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but I want you to tell me the truth.
Where were you last night?
Last night?
Why, last night...
Now, tell me the truth about this.
Were you in Cluet's apartment?
In Cluet's apartment?
Well, dear, you see, I...
She wasn't to blame, Mr Dickson.
It wasn't her fault, honest it wasn't.
- I begged her to come up.
She didn't...
Clark, you're insane to wait.
Let's get some money here and stop this run.
If we close, our stock won't be worth a nickel.
- I'll lay you 10-to-1 Dickson won't give in.
Maybe they're right, Clark.
I'll go and have a talk with him.
Dickson, I'd like to talk with you about the bank.
The bank?
All right, do anything you want with it.
Now you're talking sense.
We'll draw up an option on your stock.
Say $80 a share.
How's that?
Eighty dollars?
That's fine.
Anything you say.
I'll draw it up at once.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr Dickson?
Numbers?
No, never mind.
What's he doing?
Is he getting any help?
Something's happened.
He isn't trying any more.
They must've turned him down.
He's called the biggest people in town.
Sure, they'd turn him down.
He ought to have known that.
I'll talk to him.
We haven't got much time.
We got to do something or it'll be too late.
- Where were you last night?
- You're not giving up, are you?
- Were you in Cluet's apartment?
- I'll explain later.
You're losing your bank.
You know what that means?
- Was Mrs Dickson there?
- Don't let them lick you.
Even if some big shots turned you down, you've got other friends.
Guys who are in business because of you.
- All you got to do is...
- Wait a minute.
Answer my question.
Was Mrs Dickson there?
She was, wasn't she?
How long has this been going on?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All I know is you're losing your bank...
Please, Matt.
- Did you talk to him?
I got an idea.
Let's get to a telephone.
A 30-day option on 10,000 shares of stock in this company, now registered in the name of Thomas A. Dickson.
Get that to me in triplicate just as fast as you can.
There's no more money.
You'll have to go to the next window.
No more money?
What do you mean, there's no more money?
Go to the next window.
They'll pay you...
That's all there is.
Are you sure he's in here?
Yes, ma'am, he must be.
He hasn't come out.
I've got to get in there.
Can't you find me a key?
Yes, I think there's one right here in the drawer.
Tom, darling.
I came to explain about last night.
Cyril Cluett doesn't mean anything to me, Tom.
I went out with him last night simply because...
Well, I'd begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life, that I was an outsider.
Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre and then we went back to his apartment afterwards for a drink.
I didn't do anything wrong, Tom.
I couldn't do anything wrong.
I love you too much, you know that.
Here, here.
Dickson's in a jam.
The run's getting worse.
The big guys have the screws on.
He came through for you 100 times.
If friends don't help him, who will?
There's Mr Jones!
Any bank that Tom Dickson has anything to do with is all right.
I'm putting my money in here.
Why should you be afraid?
Tom Dickson is all right.
He's perfectly square.
I'm putting my money in this bank.
Open up.
I want to put money in here.
I don't want to take any out.
Certainly, Mr Jones.
They're starting to come in already.
Listen.
Get all the money you can, and bring it here.
Step on it.
- Who's this?
- Hello, Mr Dunkirk?
- Williams.
- Mr Williams...
I'll speak to both of them.
Those big guys got the screws on him.
You two have to help him. If friends don't help him, who will?
He came through for you 100 times.
They're coming in already.
Get all the money you can and bring it down here right away.
Both of you, step on it!
If it's all right for me, it's all right for everybody.
I'm going to make a deposit.
What's the matter with you?
I want to make a deposit.
$4,600 for Rico Mazzetti.
He's the best man in the world.
No matter what you think about me there's something far more important:
The bank, Tom, you can't give that up.
Mr Dickson!
Come here a minute. Look at this.
Something wonderful has happened.
People are making deposits.
You won't believe it until you see it.
You've got to come out.
Tom Dickson is a friend of mine.
I'll put money in his bank anytime.
Anybody who takes money out of this bank is crazy.
I'm going to put a lot of money in here.
I've got some money to deposit.
I haven't got much, but here it is.
I'd give Tom Dickson all my money anytime!
- Come out here and look at this.
- We've been waiting...
You know what you can do with that.
Look at this, a demonstration of faith worth more than all the collateral in the world.
Come on, it'll do your heart good.
They're shoving their hard-earned money across the counter with a 10-to-1 chance against them.
You want to stay with this bank, get real money over here now.
That's enough for me.
I'm ashamed of myself.
I'll have $100,000 here in five minutes.
- Now you're talking, Ames.
- I'm sold.
- Schultz?
- This is your bank, and I'm with you.
- Ives?
- My dear friends, that's what I've been trying to say all afternoon.
Clark, you can do twice as much as any of them. How about you?
I don't agree with you, but if everyone is going crazy, I'll go crazy, too.
This is Ben Schultz.
Send $100,000 cash to the Union National now.
Send all available cash to the Union National.
Currency. Small denominations.
In 10s and 20s. Yeah.
Say, I want $150,000 over here right away.
I am in my right mind.
No, not $150.
Say, listen, you guys, $150,000!
That's the trouble with people nowadays. They hear a crazy rumour, and right away they lose their heads.
Not me.
You didn't see me draw my money out, did you?
Union National Bank.
9:00 and all is lousy.
Where's Matt?
Ten-to-one he'll have a crack about the run yesterday.
It's a cinch bet. I wouldn't take it.
If he pulls a gag about the run, we'll murder the guy.
I suppose you guys had a good run for your money...
- Good morning, Mr Gardiner.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Mr Dickson.
My wife is much better this morning.
Well, that's too bad.
Mine's all right, too.
Carter!
- Morning, Mr Dickson.
- Morning.
- Well, got your uniform? - Yes, sir.
Looks good.
How much did it cost?
Mr Sampson bought it for me.
Well, I guess I'll have to see Sampson myself.
- Good morning, Helen.
Say, I know what's the matter with you.
Matt!
I want you both to take the day off.
Go downtown, get a licence, and get married.
- Well, I...
- I don't want to hear it.
If you don't get married, I'll fire the both of you.
Helen, while you're downtown, stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria, sailing next week.
- Gee, thanks...
- No. It's not for you.
You're only going to get married.
Mrs Dickson and I are going on the honeymoon.
Come on, slave.
- Five and a half fathoms!
- Five and a half fathoms! Five and a half!
That smooth spot between the two lines of breakers.
Yeah, I see it.
Four and a half, getting shallow fast!
Four and a half, getting shallow!
Four and a half. Steady!
George says three fathoms through passage.
Hey, Tinker, ease that mainsheet!
- How many feet in a fathom?
Eighteen feet through the passage.
Yeah, and the ship takes fifteen of those.
Oh, three feet to spare.
Well, I forgot to bring my water-wings!
Good morning, St. Peter!
Three and a half fathoms!
- Three and a half! - Draught, Skipper, how old's that chart?
Stand by everybody, we're going through the passage!
- Mind that jib, Chief!
- Breakers abaft! Catch the swell on the right so we'll ride it through!
Here they come!
Look out, Johnny!
We made it, we're over!
- Great work, Sir! - I bet we didn't have an inch to spare!
You bet not!
- Take the wheel, will ya?
Five and a half and getting deeper!
Great stuff, Kid, we're in.
- Made it by inches!
Well after this I'll do all my yachting ashore!
Aw, you're always crabby, that's a sport.
Well, you can have it, I don't want it.
Say! You ought to get shock absorbers on this boat.
Sailors, come and get it!
Now, now, now, now!
Natives!
Look at these!
Hellooo. - What's that supposed to be?
- The call of the wild.
- Johnny, you're outta luck, no blondes!
You don't suppose they're cannibals, do you?
Well, if they are, we'll feed 'em you!
Maybe they're not allowed to eat ham.
Don't do that, I'm sensitive!
- What do you call this place?
- Probably one of the Virgin Islands.
Heaven forbid!
Here, take this for bait.
Girls, come and get some Chester, pleeeease.
Johnny, here's the charm of the South Seas:
You cruise about and out of nowhere you tumble onto one of these little islands.
And you'll nearly always find the natives a happy and carefree people.
Yeah, I know Fond of light wines and dancing.
Hey!
Hello, Baby, got anything on for tonight?
I give you my heart's blood.
They want to play.
This water!
Boy, I never did like a hard clock anyway.
I've wanted you boys to get rid of these things for a long time.
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't throw those things overboard! Oh, they have lots of clothes.
Say, Johnny, see that little girl over there?
- Here's a present for you.
- Shark!
- Shark?
Shark!
Get the rifle!
Submerged right there!
Hey! Don't shoot him, you might hit a native!
- Here! Give me a hand with this line!
Hey! Don't do that!
Steady now! Cut him loose, quick!
Do whatever you have to do, but don't pull it!
When the shark took the bait, your ol' foot got caught up in the rope and over you went.
How did I get out of it?
The line parted between you and the shark, looks like it's been cut.
Probably one of the natives.
Which one?
Go on, Sweetheart, I'm listening.
Sardines again.
- Not bad, eh? - Perfect!
- I'm drunk again.
- Oh! I was just tired, I know.
Say, he must be the Big Medicine around here, eh, Skipper?
That 's the guy that feeds the volcano.
- Feeds the volcano? - Sure!
That's the way they keep the volcano quiet.
He feeds it. - Throws it the fish?
- No, Sir!
They must be young and beautiful to please the volcano.
He wants us to eat.
- I can't make up my mind what I want? - Got any straws?
What is this, a paper hanger's convention?
All kiding aside, Skippy, what...what is this? It's poi.
- Poi? - It's a poi.
- Poi or girl, I wouldn't like it.
You remember the poi your mother used to bake!
Apple poi, lemon poi, rhubarb poi... Oh! That kine of poi!
Well, here goes!
That's good!
That's beautiful, Mac!
Hello there!
Sure, I'm the guy. Sure!
Boy, that's good! I've eaten worse than this in the Waldorf.
Hey, Skipper, what is this?
It's octopus. Octopus?
If something crawls and stabs at you tonight, Hector, it's me! . Ooh!
It's got me, I'm an octopus.
Skipper, what are they sore about?
How you can certainly pick 'em, that's the King's daughter.
Yeah, that's all right with me.
Yeah, but it isn't all right with them, she's taboo.
What do you mean?
Well, you see, they have rules about such things in the Islands.
No one's supposed to touch her except a native prince. They're very strict about it. You're going to get your throat cut, Johnny.
Well, Johnny, it looks to me that the only out is for you to run for the job of Native Prince on the democratic ticket this fall.
It's funny, Mac, what the tropics'll do to a kid like Johnny.
I wish they did it to me. You better keep you eye on him, Mac.
He's going native.
Ol' Devil Night's got 'im!
Ol' Tom-Tom done stole our Johnny away.
Don't you wish your were young enough to feel the way that that kid feels. That's right, Mac
Not me, might keep me awake.
Say, did you see the expression on Johnny's face when that witch doctor was doin' all the...?
Say, what made that plant shrivel up like that, anyhow?
I blew my breath on it.
You little devil!
I'll get even with you!
You gonna let me see your face?
Hey Mac, what's happened to Johnny? I can't find him...
his bunk hasn't been slept in.
Hey, Skipper, is Johnny on board? - I have't seen him, where is he?
- What's all the ruckus?
Johnny's not on the boat.
What are you grinning about, Mac?
Well, as a matter of fact, I had a long talk with Johnny last night.
And he's decided to stay on the island and we'll pick him up on the way back. - On the Island? -Yep!
Aw, you're kidding, Mac, Johnny's somewhere on this boat.
No I'm not kidding and, as a matter of fact, I think it's a swell idea.
I wish I'd done the same thing when I was a kid. Why, this is ridiculous!
Hey, Skipper, turn around, we're going back.
He'll never get out of there alive, those people are savages. - Come on Skipper, let's go back.
- Come on! Turn around! We're not going back, we're going on right as we are.
- Mac, are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad.
I think I know Johnny a little better than you fellows.
Matter of fact, I'm for him 100%, and I told him so last night.
So that's that!
Now, don't you boys worry about Johnny, I packed his duffle bag and put in everything he'll need.
Let's see...hot water bottle, bicarbonate of soda, needle and thread, a box of toothpicks, tennis racket, golf sticks, a bottle of ginger ale... Oh! And a ukulele.
What are you doin' here? You're gonna cut yourself with that!
Hey there, Oscar, you have my boy's shirt!
What are you doing?
Here, give me that!
What's going on around here?
Hey, what's the big idea?
My, my, my...roses!
Hey, who thought this up?
I don't get you, Sister.
Oh, you want me to sit down. Oh!
Well, all right, I'll try anything once!
I don't get you, Baby.
Oh, you want me to struggle with you.
Never on occasions like this!
Well, all right, but remember I'm only pretending!
Ene-hu again!
Ene-hu more!
Seems we have company.
Come on baby.
We gotta make a run for it.
A happy carefree peoples... fond of light wines and dancing, huh?
What does it say?
You don't tell me.
Well, I'll have to consult my secretary before I can tell you about that. Here!
Take a letter!
What's that about Luana?
Oh, I see.
Oh, I see! Luana!
That's me! The white stick, huh?
Native.
Luana go down to native village, huh? Marry native prince, kanaka?
Ya can't get down there, it's too steep!
Luana, don't go with them, Luana!
White man want you to stay here with him always. Don't you understand, Luana?
I want you to stay here with me.
Untie my hands!
Untie the rope!
Where I can get a canoe? I've gotta have a canoe!
A canoe!
Don't you understand?
Oh, taboo, bunk!
I've got to have a canoe!
Here, you get me a canoe I give you this, it's nice and soft.
Here, I give you this...
Do you smoke?
Oh, it doesn't hurt you.
Here! Here! You can have it!
Now get me canoe!
Canoe, see? Canoe!
I'll take it away from you unless you get me a canoe right away!
Do I get a canoe?
All right.
Paint job, huh?
Great idea!
Here, put some on my back!
Oh, I see what you mean:
OUR HOME.
OUR HOME?
That's swell!
Water!
- You're a cinch!
Food, huh?
FUDAH?
No, not FUDHUNH...
FOOD!
Practically perfect!
Oh! I see! Coconuts.
Oh, I'm afraid I get you, Sweetheart.
Do you wanna help me up?
Well, here it goes!
Here comes a big one!
Heads up!
Did it get wet?
Here comes another one!
Lovely!
Oh! Knife!
I'm glad you know how to do all of these things.
I'd be lost out here!
Spilled a little.
You spill it!
You're filling me.
You take a little now! See how you like it.
Um! That's marvelous!
Kiss me!
Suppose I make you kiss me?
I'll teach you to run away from me!
Rain!
Say! I fell like a potato bug!
We can't run under these leaves every time it rains.
I've go to build a house.
House?
Yeah! A place to live in. A shelter.
You know, a place to sleep.
Oh, yeah! Well, that, too!
Let it rain, let it pour!
Well, do you like it?
Finish house, huh?
It's a palace, it's a castle.
Look, Whiskers, now you have place for sleep! Hey, Nick!
I didn't build that house for the goat, I built for you and me.
You do everything.
Yeah, I'm a great guy all right.
You happy?
And when the gang comes back, I'm gonna take you home with me.
No, Johnny.
Oh, why not?
Some day, Pele angry.
Tom-toms call,
I go.
You mean to the volcano?
I won't let you go. You belong to me now, see?
If I not here here when Pele calls, then Pele angry.
You too!
Volcano curse on you.
- You die, too. - Aw!
Now, thats a lot of hooey!
I'm not afraid of Pele and what the volcano curse can do to me.
And you're not gonna be afraid either.
I'm gonna take you back to civilization.
We don't have any crazy, superstitious ideas about volcanoes being mad at people and putting a curse on 'em.
Civilization? Where is that?
Well, it's...that's not a place.
That's where things are happening, people are accomplishing something. Did I tell you about the radio?
Well, all you do is sit there and turn a little dial, and all of a sudden, out of the air comes sound.
Isn't that swell?
Now, look, it's getting dark. Now, if we were in San Francisco, bingo! I'd press a button..
Oh, Johnny, but it is so nice in the dark.
Say, Luana, you certainly make civilization look silly. But it's not, really!
It's great!
Gee, wait 'til you see it!
Market Street with all its traffic and lights.
People going to theaters. Hotels with grand, tiled bathrooms... Hot water running into steaming tubs.
Gee, Luana, civilization's...
You're a sweet kid.
What are they gonna do to you?
I make big sin, Johnny.
They give me to Pele.
Aw, you haven't sinned.
I loved you and you loved me, that's all there is to it!
But I taboo for white man, Johnny.
That's not true!
Oh, I caused all this.
I am happy, Johnny.
I happy you steal me away and we live together. I happy you teach me kiss. I happy you hold me.
I happy for everything!
It was best thing that ever come to me.
I thought I just had a yen for ya.
I thought this was only gonna be a lark!
Oh, but I love you, Luana. I love you more than I've ever loved anyone. More than I COULD love anyone!
Thank you very much... Johnny.
Do you understand?
Let her go! Let her go! I'll give you anything you want.
Ships, knives, canoes, anything. Only, but let her go, please, please!
What is it? Whatsa matter, Luana?
What did he say?
Prince say now you come for me,
Pele angry.
Volcano curse on you!
Prince say you die...too.
Well, that's all right.
That's sort of as it should be.
No, that's wrong!
I sin, Pele God He angry at me.
No, Pele is no God, Luana.
He's only a hole in the ground.
There's only one God, Luana.
Oh, God, help us.
Get her out of this.
"Our Father which art in heaven," "Hallowed be thy name." "Thy kingdom come,"
They're coming for us!
I've got to kiss you, Luana!
Try! See if you can reach me!
Oh, do what you want to me! Let her alone!
Don't shoot anymore, Skipper
Wait and see what happens.
Yeah, that'll fix ya up, young fella.
And don't you move that arm!
That's a bad hole they put in you.
Why, hello, Luana.
Johnny...die?
No, no, no!
There is nothing to worry about.
In a day or two he'll be just as good as new.
No savvy, huh?
Johnny...well...one...two...day.
Come here, come here!
Come on now, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Come on, you come up on deck with me.
Johnny...all right!
You come on now!
How is he, Mac?
He's still feverish, but he'll put out all right.
Well, Fellas, what's the verdict?
Does she go with us or does she stay here?
I still contend that she won't stand transplanting.
You know, you take a girl that's been filled with superstition all her life, you can't suddenly adapt her to our ways.
Aw, for heaven's sake, you talk like some old Aunt Emma!
This is 1932!
She's a swell girl and I like her! That Kipling stuff is a lot of hooey!
You're wrong, Chester.
That boy's whole life is wrapped up in his family.
Why, if he came home with a native wife, it'd break his mother's heart!
"For East is East, and West is West," "and never the twain shall meet."
Mac, what's the dope on the North and South?
Aw, shut up!
Oh, Johnny.
Pele not like you. You take me away from him.
He mad. He want you die too.
But I not let you.
I go to Pele.
He forgive...everything work right for you.
Luana...
- No. - Yes, Johnny.
- Water.
...a drink.
Water.
- What do you want?
- Something about Luana.
Hey, Skipper, find out what he wants!
It's the old chief, the girl's father, he's come for her.
Well, you tell him he can't have her, that we're taking he back with us.
He says that the volcano curse has been put on Johnny, and unless the girl returns with them, Johnny will die, too.
My father right!
I go...please.
No, Luana, we're going to take you with us.
No, I go go back to my people.
I say goodbye to Johnny.
No, Luana...
We take you with us.
Mac, if I had that much courage, I'd...
Hey, Skipper, let's get outta here. This place is getting my goat!
THE BLUE LIGHT
Good day Mister.
Greetings.
Can we stay here tonight? .
Tomorrow we would like to go to Monte Christallo.
Who is this person Junta? .
Junta? .
Ernst, come in.
Bring the book here, it is about Junta.
Horst, it is now the right time to read about the Blue Light on the mountain.
Did Junta really live? .
Have we arrived? .
Does this road lead to Santa Maria? .
Hey Sir...
Is he mute or doesn't he understand German? .
Bye.... bye...
I am the hotel manager of Santa Maria.
Oh thank God...
finally somebody who speaks German.
Did you come to pick me up? .
What are these strange sculptures? .
These are the boys of the village who fell off the mountain.
You are not very joyful here.
It's a full moon, a bad day for Santa Maria.
What does that have to do with the moon? .
A curse on our village since the big flow that came down from the Monte Christallo.
When it is full moon, there is a blue light shining on the rock.
Each time the young boys want to go up and each time... and each time one cross more.
I planted a cross for my youngest son.
Tonio! .
Why are you so against that girl? .
She is not normal
How can she climb towards the blue light... on the steep side of the mountain... while the young boys fall down every time?
This Junta, she's the damned devil's witch.
Do not close the shutters, it's such nice weather
It's a full moon.
Ah yes, the blue light...
My son... six months ago... he was the fourth victim this year...
Silvio! .
Silvio!
....
There she is, the devil's witch.
It's all her fault, it's her fault.
Guzzi!
Guzzi...
Junta!
I'm here...
Hey... what's the matter? .
have some... eat.
I was on the street, early this morning
All of a sudden I saw a crowd in front of Maria's house
I heard Maria, who shouted :
""Junta, Junta!".
I was afraid and ran away... then I saw the threatening crowd.
They ran after me with sticks... they threatened me with their fists and they shouted : ""Aaaa... aaaaa... "
They threw stones at me...
I was running but they came nearer and nearer...
Then a man jumped from a window... he stood there with his arm like this and shouted : ""Stop!".
Junta, where are you? .
Junta...
Hi! Ah... Hello...
What do you have there? .
Is that milk? .
Hey...
It's very nice here.
I'd like to stay here...
Now I must go.
I want to leave here before it gets dark... but I will come again.
Tomorrow, I will come again
For sure.
So...
See you again.
Junta
I wanted to say something
Tomorrow, I'll go back to the mountains.
I might stay over there for a few days... so do not get worried.
Good day Sir.
So Junta, here I am again.
And this is a small contribution for our life in common.
This is bread.
Bread.
Cheese.
How nice, how nice...
But where shall I sleep? .
I guess you sleep there... and the little boy over there...
And me? .
Sleeping? .
To sleep?
.
To sleep!
Ah...
I understand, I understand.
But where? .
There... you can sleep here.
You' ll sleep very well.
Junta, little witch...
you make me behave like a fool...
If only we could speak with each other it would be perfect.
I have been here for many weeks now and... I'll not go back ever... back to the people....
I'm afraid...
Ju nta...
what's happen ing with you? .
little Junta...
What? .
Junta... Junta... what's happening with you?
Come and show me what you brought from the village.
Let's have a look.
Junta... my little Junta...
How can I explain it to you... you cannot understand me...
What's the matter? .
Those crystals... they are a danger for you... and for the whole village.
But they could be a blessing.
The peasants should be told about it.
Let me go now
Don't go.
It's a real treasure... it must be found... and brought to the village.
You'll never have to run around in these rag clothes anymore.
I'll come back.
Very soon
See you!
It's not here... that you should climb
But here, at this side... till those rocks.
And then, do not climb there, but here, and you will find the entrance to the grotto.
We understand.
Junta.
That's how the poor Junta of Santa Maria died
But her memory lives on in the village, the people who persecuted her so much they got rich with the stones of the Monte Christallo.
End of the story of Junta
Hey, you guys, wait a minute.
How far is it to the next town?
-Only 10 miles.
-Then it's no use, boys. I'm through.
Just cover me with leaves and tell my mother I died with her name on my lips.
Time out while we watch Joe die.
is anyone around here human enough to give me a cigarette?
Here you are.
And you're the guy who said this was going to be a pleasure trip.
-lt's part of your education.
-Yeah?
You can't leave Germany without taking a walking trip.
Why can't I?
Oh, look!
As I live and breathe, a taxicab in the middle of the Black Forest.
Hey, brother, can you give us a lift into town?
We've been hiking all day and we're tired. Tired.
What did he say?
He says he's engaged for the whole afternoon.
That settles it.
He just wants to bargain.
We'll pay you well.
We're Americans.
-What did he say?
-He says he's a man of honour.
-Theatre?
Actresses?
-Actresses?
Are they young?
Ask him quickly, for heaven's sakes, how many of them are there?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Did you say you were sailing in three weeks?
I've cancelled my reservations.
-Three, four, five, six--
-Get out!
-Sit down!
-l wasn't--
They seem disturbed about something.
-Do you suppose we're not welcome?
-Are there six or are there seven?
[Helen speaking in German] I'm sorry, Miss, but I don't understand a word.
-Will you please go away?
-You speak English.
Really quite a surprise.
Have you just come from America?
-Rather a long swim, isn't it?
-Will you go away?
What a charming country this is.
I've half a mind to settle here for good.
Would you mind telling me how long this is going to keep up?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Now that you call my attention to it, I guess I am.
Please. We have to be back in the theatre by 6:00.
Otherwise, we'll all lose our positions.
We wouldn't dream of being the cause of that.
But if we go... will you and your friends meet us for something to eat after the show tonight?
We'll do nothing of the kind.
All right then, my little water nymph, we'll stay.
I think you are the most impossible person I've ever met!
Look, Mummy, I'm a crocodile.
Got it.
Missed it.
-Look, Mummy, I'm a fish.
-Excuse me, I thought you were a boat.
No, I've changed now. I'm a fish.
Sit up, Johnny.
You know I have no time to play.
Father will be back soon.
-Sit down.
-Thank you, Doctor.
Well, young man, what seems to be your trouble?
Dr. Pierce, I have a rather peculiar request to make.
I want to sell you my body.
Why do you particularly want to sell it to me?
Well, sir, in view of your reputation on this side of the water... I had an idea that my body in its present condition... might be very interesting to you.
Before as well as after death.
-What's the matter with you?
-l've been poisoned by radium emanations.
-What is your occupation?
-l'm a commercial chemist.
I've been working on a process whereby the various radium products... can be utilised without danger.
How long have you been working on this thing?
-Ten or twelve years.
-That's a very valuable idea.
Who made your diagnosis?
I know enough about the symptoms to do it myself.
-Have you had any blood tests lately?
-Three weeks ago and again last night.
I think I'm good for another eight months, a year at the most.
I wish I could help you, but I'm afraid I can't.
Do you know anybody else who might be interested in my condition?
Look here, Doctor, I need money very badly.
Why, are you married?
I wouldn't have come here if I weren't.
-Any children?
-Yes, a little boy.
-Does your wife know about your condition?
-She does.
I told her last night.
Come to think of it, I've just heard from a friend of mine in Germany.
There's a specialist there named....
What was that name?
Holzapfel.
-Been pretty successful in cases like yours.
-Holzapfel?
At Dresden?
Do you know him?
-Do I know him?
He was one of my professors when I was studying over there.
He was, was he?
Doctor, how much do you think it would cost?
Well, the cure is said to take three or four months.
I should say about $1,500.
$1,500?
-That's a lot of money, isn't it?
-lt certainly is.
-Aren't you working?
-Only at odd jobs, one or two days a week.
Let's see. I could let you have, say, $50.
No, Doctor, thank you.
Thank you so much for your patience.
Glad you came to see me.
Bedtime, Johnny.
Daddy, can't I just stay up 10 minutes longer?
-Five?
-Two?
Alley-oop.
Wait a minute, Mummy.
Right in the bull's eye, Johnny.
-Which one are you going to tell me?
-Which one do you want to hear?
-The one about Germany.
-But you've heard that one so often.
-l want to hear it again.
-Ned.
-All set, Daddy?
-You bet.
Go on, Mummy.
It was springtime in Germany.... lt was springtime in Germany, and it was warm.
I had spring fever and the air was full of blossoms.
Now it's your turn.
-And what did you do?
-We went to the pool, of course.
-And what do you suppose we saw?
Imagine!
Half a dozen princesses taking a bath.
-And what did you do when you saw him?
-l told him to go away.
-And did he?
-He did not.
And what happened then?
The most beautiful princess of all... said that if I'd go away, she'd grant me my wish.
-And what did you wish?
-l wished to see her again.
I couldn't think of anything better to wish.
So that night I went to a theatre, and music began to play.
And out upon the stage stepped this princess... and she looked more beautiful than ever.
She was beautiful!
And then your heart began to go like this?
And Mummy began to sing?
And my heart stopped beating entirely.
What happened to you when you saw him?
I could hardly sing, and I could barely wait until I saw him again.
But you did see him again, didn't you?
I met him later that night.
-What happened then?
-You can never guess.
-We went walking.
-Go on, walk.
Okay, skipper.
And then we came to a park.
Only there was a tremendously large yellow moon up in the sky.
It was altogether too big and too bright.
But it was dark under the trees, very dark.
This is a tree, Johnny.
-And what happened under the tree?
-Then he kissed me.
-And what happened after that?
-He kissed me again.
And what happened then?
Then we were married.
And then?
And then we started to think about you--
Get out of here.
Would you need that $1,500 all at once?
No, but if I had $300, I could at least get to Germany.
I haven't yet figured out a way of paying the rent... unless I part with the microscope.
So I'm afraid we'll have to postpone our trip abroad this year.
I could earn that money by going back to the stage.
I won't have you do that.
But the doctor says you must go away.
If I worked a few weeks, I might make enough for your passage.
And then we'll find a way to keep you over there... until you get well.
It's out of the question.
I won't have you go back to the stage.
-Ned?
-What is it?
I was going back to my old work anyway.
-Will it make you happy?
-lt isn't that. We need money.
It's only a question of weeks.
My formula is almost completed...
-and then we'll have all the money we need.
-l know, dear.
But in the meantime, I'm going to do something to give you a chance to get well.
AGENT: Have you come to be placed?
HELEN: Yes.
-What's your name?
-Faraday.
-Helen Faraday.
-Got an appointment? -No, I haven't.
You'll have to wait, all these people are ahead of you.
Thank you, honey. I'll see you later.
Going to lunch, Sally, be back in 10 minutes.
MAN: Morning, Mr. Smith.
You remember me?
WOMAN: What about the job you said you had for me?
smith: Just a minute, folks. Just a minute--
jim: You remember my dramatic sketch, Mr. Smith?
smith: Just a minute, Jim.
You're waiting to see me, aren't you?
Run along, Eddy, I'll see you later.
Come on in, baby.
WOMAN: I beg your pardon, we've been here a long time!
smith: You'll be here a long time after she's gone.
Sit down, take a load off your feet.
-When was the last time you worked?
-Five or six years ago.
-Germany.
-Can you put over a song?
-l used to be able to.
-How much will you take?
-Anything I can get. lt doesn't matter.
Don't tell me you're working just for the love of your art.
-Who's your boyfriend?
-l haven't any.
-Will you work for $25 a week?
Well, you're in luck, baby.
You came to the right man.
I guess, maybe I can get you $30 or $40.
I might be able to raise it to $50.
That includes commission, of course.
I generally get 20% , but seeing it's you, I'll make it 15.
-ls that okay?
You know that ain't a high commission... considering the personal service I give my clientele.
Why, the minute you put yourself in my hands, baby... your interests are closer to me than my own. Get me?
Get up and walk around a bit.
Let's see what you got.
-What I've got?
-Let's see your legs.
-ls that enough?
-For the time being.
-What did you say your name was?
No, we got to get something different.
Something unusual.
Something that's easy to say and hard to forget.
Jones. I got it.
Helen Jones.
But my name isn't Jones.
What of it?
My name ain't Smith either, but I get by just the same, don't I?
Tell her I'm out to lunch.
Call up O'Connor's and tell him I'm bringing him a pip.
You've certainly got me all hopped up, baby.
Yup, you certainly got me hopped up.
So, this is the pip you phoned about.
Where did you pick her up?
I ran across her a long time ago. I've been saving her for a spot like this.
-Can she croon? What I need's a crooner.
-She can croon in a pinch. Who can't?
I got one good-looker eating her head off on me already.
-l don't know if I can use another. -All right, then.
All right.
I got three or four spots I can place this dame without half trying.
Come on, baby.
Wait a minute.
What's your hurry?
I didn't say I wouldn't give her a tryout, did I?
And if she makes good, it's $40 a week and her grub the first week.
$50 the next, and $75 if she stays on.
And you take out my 15% every Saturday night.
-l was figuring on starting her at $30.
-$30?
I don't handle no $30 junks. Scram.
All right.
All right. Keep your shirt on.
-What did you say your name was?
-Jones.
Well, we'll change that.
Come on, I'll show you your dressing room.
A little after 6:00.
What's all the rush?
You said you weren't on till 10:00.
Yes I know, but I have to rehearse again.
Johnny, darling, I forgot my hairbrush.
It's on my dresser.
Good heavens, where is my music?
-This it?
-Here you are, Mummy.
Thank you, Johnny.
Yes, thank you.
Johnny is to have his soup, carrots, toast, a glass of milk, and a pudding.
And don't let him stay up late.
Here you are, Mummy.
-What's that for?
-Good luck.
Thank you, Johnny. I need it.
-Goodbye, Ned.
-Goodbye, Helen.
I hate to see you do this.
Don't, Ned. Don't make it too difficult.
Good night, Ned.
Good night, Johnny.
Good night, Helen.
What time will you be back?
It might be late, better not sit up for me.
-Bye, Mummy.
-Goodbye, Johnny.
Come on, Johnny, we better have our dinner now.
Gee whiz, are we going to have dinner on our own every night?
I don't know, Johnny.
So you're the Blonde Venus?
Don't tell me you thought of that label all by yourself.
No, Mr. O'Connor told me it would help me in my work.
He would. He didn't have to think up any name for me... when I helped put this dump on the map.
My name's "Taxi Belle" Hooper.
Taxi for short.
Do you charge for the first mile?
Say, you trying to ride me?
Don't get the wrong idea. They call me Taxi... because I won't ride in nothing else.
Safety first, that's my motto.
Good drinking partners always make bad drivers.
"Do I charge for the first mile?"
-Hello, Taxi.
-Hello.
How are you getting along, Miss Jones?
Almost ready?
Almost, thank you.
That "Blonde Venus" gag of mine did the trick.
The house is packed.
I'll have my hands full tonight.
-Why were you late again? Run out of gas?
-Don't crab, I couldn't help it.
-Nick just came in.
-Why tell me?
You're not pulling any wool over my eyes.
I'm sick and tired of this joint.
O'Connor would jump all over me if it wasn't for Nick.
Look what he gave me the other night.
-Who, O'Connor?
-No, that tightwad wouldn't give you... the sleeves out of his vest.
This bracelet is a present from Nick Townsend.
You've heard of him.
The politician, loads of jack.
Runs this end of town.
I can hock it any day I like for $1500.
-$1500?
-Yeah, maybe I can get more.
I did him a little favour once and this is how he came through.
I wish he'd ask me for some other favours, if you know what I mean.
I told you once before my name wasn't Georgy.
-And it ain't Oscar either.
-All right, Rudolph, have it your own way.
Are you going to get up, or are you going to take it sitting down?
Why don't you go back to your table and behave yourself?
-Come on, guy.
-O'Connor, leave him alone. I'll manage him.
Now look, why don't you cool down and run along?
We don't want any trouble.
-Yellow, huh?
-Yes, maybe I am.
As a matter of fact, I'm scared stiff.
And being reasonably certain that someone's going to get a punch in the jaw... I'm going to make sure it isn't me.
Are you going back for more, or will we go home, you big stiff?
WOMAN: Come on, Mary.
MAN: Who hit me?
Sorry this happened, Mr. Townsend.
That's all right, O'Connor.
I rather enjoyed it.
All right, Jimmie, let's go.
Trot 'em out.
Say, I wish you'd quit picking on these fellows.
I've filled every hospital in town for you now.
All right, boss, I'll do my best, but I can't help it if these birds get my goat.
-Say, look out where you're going.
-What a fine evening this turned out to be.
All right now, Monsieur.
Table number 1 4 for this party.
Say, Charlie, is that gorilla real?
Say, lady, if that animal was real... I wouldn't be here.
Here you are, Miss Hooper.
It's all ready for you.
How's the show going, Charlie?
I think it's going to be pretty good.
-Hello, Nick, darling.
-Sit down, Taxi.
-Do you mind?
-No, go right ahead.
[Singing] Did you ever happen to hear a voodoo?
Hear it and you won't give a darn what you do
Tom-toms put me under a sort of hoodoo
And the whole night long I don't know the right from wrong
Hot voodoo, black as mud Hot voodoo, in my blood
That African tempo
Has made me a slave
Hot voodoo, dance of sin Hot voodoo, worse than gin
I'd follow a caveman
Right into his cave
That beat gives me a wicked sensation
My conscience wants to take a vacation
Got voodoo, head to toes Hot voodoo, burn my clothes
I want to start dancing Just wearing a smile
Hot voodoo, I'm aflame I'm really not to blame
That African tempo is meaner than mean
Hot voodoo makes me brave I want to misbehave
I'm beginning to feel like an African queen
Those drums bring out The devil inside me
I need some great big angel to guide me
Hot voodoo gets me wild Oh, fireman, save this child
I'm going to blazes
I want to be bad
-Not bad, eh, Henry?
-l should say not.
-Where'd you dig her up, O'Connor?
-How do you like her, boys?
-Pretty good.
-Say, O'Connor, I'd like to meet her.
-You would?
-You can fix it up, can't you?
I don't know whether I can or not.
Why don't you go backstage and find out for yourself?
If you don't think he will, you're crazy.
-Mind if I go along, too, Charlie?
-l knew you'd horn in.
-You don't mind if I come along?
-What if I did?
nick: Be back in a minute, Taxi.
All right, boys.
This is my good friend, Mr. Nick Townsend.
Miss Jones.
-How do you do, Miss Jones?
-Mr. Townsend.
-Mr. Henry Johnson.
-Miss Jones.
-Mr. Johnson.
-Say, Charlie, what's your last name?
-Blaine.
-Pleased to meet you, Miss Jones.
-Thank you, Mr. Blaine.
-Sit down, gentlemen.
-How about ordering something to drink?
BLAlNE: What'll you have, Miss Jones?
-Smoke?
-No, thank you.
-You won't last very long in this place.
-Why won't she?
-She's got too much class for this joint.
-She has?
Beat it, Charlie.
I knew that was coming.
Good night, Miss Jones.
See you later, O'Connor.
-Blaine is the name.
-l got you.
Good night, Henry.
-Good night, Miss Jones.
-You can run along, too, if you like.
-l was just going out anyway.
You've got about 20 minutes before your next number, baby.
You're quite at home here, aren't you, Mr. Townsend?
I don't know. I'm not exactly a stranger here.
Flowers for you, Miss Jones.
Wait a minute.
Here we are.
Are these from you?
Were you expecting them from anyone else?
You embarrass me, Mr. Townsend.
You better go now. I have to dress.
What are we going to do about tonight?
Shall I wait for you after the show?
I think I'd rather go home alone.
-Honestly, you'd do me a great favour.
-A great favour?
Yes, a great favour.
Will I get a bracelet for it?
-Has Taxi been talking about me?
-She said some very nice things about you.
Well, now, don't get the wrong idea.
Taxi really did me a favour and only a favour.
And there's nothing more between us than just that... although she'd like to give people the impression that there is.
How am I to believe that, Mr. Townsend?
I'll give you a bracelet.
There's nothing between us, is there?
I don't accept bracelets from a stranger.
There's no reason why we should remain strangers.
This kid certainly looks like you.
I was waiting up for you.
I guess I fell asleep.
Late enough.
You'd better go to bed and get some sleep.
I need some too.
We have a big day ahead of us.
We must buy tickets and pack and get you off quickly.
Tickets?
Pack? Why, don't tell me....
You can't have got the money already.
The manager gave me an advance.
Don't ask me more now. I'm too tired.
Of course, I forgot.
You must be tired.
Tell me, Ned, do you love me?
Helen, what's wrong?
Do I love you?
You silly little thing.
What a question.
Promise me to get well and come back to me.
Of course I'll come back.
I wish I didn't have to go away.
I wish I could spend every moment of my life with you.
Do I love you?
You poor little thing.
-Goodbye, Ned.
-Goodbye, darling.
It's only for six months.
-Come back strong and well.
-Of course I will.
-Say goodbye to Daddy, darling.
-Goodbye, Daddy.
-Take good care of Mummy, Johnny.
-l will, Daddy.
-Goodbye.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Goodbye, Ned.
Goodbye, Helen.
Goodbye, Johnny.
You better learn to write, Johnny, so you can send me some letters.
-Mummy?
-What is it, Johnny?
-Has Daddy gone away for good?
-No, dear, he'll be back soon.
I want him to come back soon.
-Hello, Helen.
-l wish you hadn't come here.
I'm sorry, Helen. I figured you'd need cheering up.
This is Mr. Townsend, Johnny.
-How do you do, Johnny?
-Hello, Mr. Townsend.
-Can I take you home?
-You shouldn't have come here.
Give me that dog, will you, Tom?
-lsn't he a beauty, Johnny?
-For me?
When I was your age, I'd have given my right leg for one of those.
-Can I keep him, Mummy?
-Yes, Johnny.
Come along, let me take you home.
You'd have to take a taxi, anyway.
I'm no magician. I can't pick her out of the air.
-l've done my best to find her.
-Did you try her home?
Sure. I tried her home and I found out plenty.
She's married.
-Married?
-And what's more, she's got a kid.
-And her husband's gone to Europe... for his health.
-For his health?
-He sailed three weeks ago.
She ain't been home all day and neither has the kid... and nobody knows when she'll be back.
Maybe something's happened to them.
And me picking a winner for the first time this year.
Blooie goes my 15% .
Why, the next one I get I'll nail down, if I have to marry her.
What's the idea of sending for me in a rush?
Hello, Taxi.
How are you, darling?
-What's wrong?
-There's nothing wrong.
I got a swell new number all lined up for you.
I want you to start rehearsing it this afternoon.
Yeah. There's a catch in this somewhere.
O'Connor, I meant to call you up yesterday, but I didn't get around to it.
Miss Jones isn't going to work for you anymore.
What's the idea?
She can't quit me like this.
-Who's that?
-Nick Townsend.
After me giving her all this publicity and working up a swell following for her.
Do you happen to have a contract with Miss Jones?
-Do you have that dame under contract?
-Have I got a million dollars?
I don't need no contract with my artists.
My word's as good as my bond... and I stand to lose a lot of dough if she don't show up.
You ought to see the drop in my business the last two days she hasn't been here.
I'll talk to you about that later.
Meantime, you just forget about Miss Jones.
O'Connor's isn't a fit place for you to be seen in night after night.
Besides, you got Johnny to look after now.
Who's going to take care of him if you keep on working?
You can't make enough money there anyway to send to your husband... unless you meet another sucker like me.
And there's another thing I want you to do.
A friend of mine has left town and his apartment is empty.
I suggest that you and Johnny spend the summer there.
It'll do both of you a lot of good.
What do you expect for all of this?
Nothing. I like you, that's all.
And I think you've got a swell kid.
And I'm trying to help you both out of a tight spot.
There's no use trying to fool myself, or you, Helen.
I'm crazy about you, and I want you to like me, too, if you can.
You're making it difficult for me not to.
Come on, honey, give me a little kiss, will you?
Just a little one?
-How are you, Mrs. Weiss? -l'm fine, Mrs. Collins.
How are you?
-l'm all right. lt's a fine day.
-Yeah, it's a fine day.
-Have you seen Mrs. Faraday? -No, I didn't see Mrs. Faraday.
-Was she here again? -Yes, she was here again.
-She's living now with her sister, you know?
-Her sister?
-l thought it was her aunt.
-Maybe you are right. Maybe it was her aunt.
-Or maybe it was her uncle.
-Yeah, maybe it was her grandmother.
-Anything the matter?
-He's coming back.
-When?
-ln about a month.
-Completely cured?
-Yes, he's well now.
-What are you going to do?
-Go back to him.
-Do you want to?
-He's my husband.
-l see.
You going to tell him about me?
-Do you still love him?
-He needs me.
-So do I, Helen.
-Not the way he does.
You're strong, Nick.
He's not.
JOHNNY: Did Peter Pan have wings?
MARY: No.
-Did he have an aeroplane?
Well, then how'd he fly?
We're going for a walk, Mrs. Faraday.
-Goodbye, Mummy.
-Goodbye, sweetheart.
Have a nice walk.
-Hello, Johnny.
-Don't stay out too late, Mary.
-No, ma'am, I won't.
When do I say goodbye to you and the kid?
I kind of wish now I'd never met you.
No, I take that back.
A little of you is worth a lifetime with any other woman.
Let's end this thing right, Helen.
Can we end it right?
Let's go away for a couple of weeks together, just you and I.
Haven't you seen her?
Doesn't she come here at all?
Sure I have.
She generally comes around here... two or three times a week for her letters.
But this time, I haven't seen her for 10 days.
Two weeks, Mr. Faraday.
-Ten days.
-Two weeks.
If you don't shut up, I'll give you a bust in the mouth.
Go on, sweep the cellar.
-We have to go back today, don't we?
There's a boat leaving for Europe tomorrow morning.
I can't stay in the same city with you without seeing you.
-How long will you be gone?
-l don't know.
A year, a couple of years.
Till I forget you.
I wish I were someone else.
Then I could stay here with you forever.
So do I, Helen, not only for my sake, but for your own.
-There's trouble ahead of you.
-l know it.
She worked here for three weeks and then she quit.
I ain't seen or heard of her since.
In this business, they come and they go.
But she wrote me you put her under contract.
Raised her salary to $150 a week.
-She did?
-Now I know where l've seen you.
You're the guy whose picture Venus had on her dressing table.
-Do you know where she is?
-No, I don't know.
-But you ask a guy named Nick Townsend--
-Shut up, if you know what's good for you.
Don't mind her.
She's cracked.
Wish I could help you locate your dame, brother.
But I don't know a thing.
In this business, they come and they go.
-Helen.
Where's Johnny?
Where've you been? What's happened?
It's been awful coming here, finding you gone, not knowing where to look for you.
Your letter said you were staying another month.
But I cabled you a week ago. Where have you been?
I'm crazy to see him.
I'll bring him as fast as I can.
We didn't know you were here.
Where is Johnny?
You haven't lived here for months.
What's happened?
If someone were to say I'd been untrue to you, would you believe it?
What do you mean "untrue"?
I had planned to lie about it.
The money you needed, I didn't get it the way I told you.
-A man gave it to me.
-ls his name Townsend?
So when you told me the manager had given you an advance and raised your salary-- lt was a lie.
Why did you do it?
How else could I have obtained money so quickly?
I ought to be grateful to you, I suppose.
How much do I owe you and him for my life?
Ned.
How much, beside the $1,500 I've gotten from you?
I'll see that you get it back.
That's simple enough, isn't it?
Well, what next?
I'm here, if you'll have me.
Go on as before?
You saved my life, and I'm very happy.
Let us go and thank this gentleman for his kindness to us.
Or would you rather I shoot him dead?
It doesn't matter.
He's not to blame. The minute I was out of sight... you took up with the first man who could give you the things I couldn't.
What puzzles me now is why you should want to come back to me.
-l love you, Ned.
-Send Johnny back here and clear out.
What are you waiting for?
Are you going to take Johnny away from me?
You've been a rotten mother to him.
You're through with him.
The law will give him to me if you don't.
If you and your friend try to put up a fight for him... I'll take the case to court.
And you'll find out soon enough who's entitled to the custody of the child.
I've been a good mother to Johnny.
Let's not dispute that point, Helen.
Johnny's all I've got left.
Bring him here, or tell me where he is and I'll get him myself.
No, I'll bring him here.
-Baltimore car, please?
-Baltimore car, next car, 1 18.
I want the police to help find my wife and child. They've been missing two days.
See Capt. Riley, room 68, down the hall, third door on your right.
Isn't this your picture, Mummy?
-Why did you do that?
-lt was such a bad picture.
I thought it was pretty good.
Where's my hat, Johnny?
Now, don't forget to lock the door.
I'll only be a few minutes, and then we'll go home and get some sleep.
I'll lock the door, Mummy.
Finish your orange juice.
How about a kiss?
[Singing] It isn't often that I want a man
But when I do It's just too bad
I know you're acting hard to get
And yet I've got a feeling you can be had
You so-and-so
You little so-and-so
Look what you've done to me
You're almost twice as bad as whosis again
I ought to take you out And how have you been?
You this-and-that
You've got me you know what
Is that the way to be?
The Greeks have words for almost everything I know
But you little so-and-so
How did you get this way?
Although you know that I have lost my control
You sit and talk about my beautiful soul
Mr. Faraday?
This is Police Headquarters.
We've got a report on your wife.
She's singing at the Star Cafe in Baltimore.
She and the child are staying at the Brittany Hotel.
Do you want us to have her arrested?
No, I'm going after her myself.
She checked out about 8:00 this morning, didn't leave a forwarding address.
If you're talking about Mrs. Blake, I heard her phoning about trains to Norfolk.
Norfolk?
Can I have a timetable, please?
Front.
-Get this gentleman a local timetable.
Key for 515, please.
-You're welcome, sir.
Please send a maid to 151 .
162.
No, 151 .
-1 75.
-Johnny!
No, it's definitely 151 .
-198.
-Hope they never find us.
-You bad boy.
-F.
-A.
-T.
-H.
-E.
-R.
-Father.
Now, fill the whole page with it.
-Did you call me, ma'am?
-Come in.
-What's your name?
-Viola.
-Viola?
-Yes, ma'am.
Johnny, this is Viola.
Viola, this is Johnny.
-How do you do, Johnny?
-Hello, Viola.
Viola is going to stay with you until I come back.
There you are. You better not try to get a job in this town, young lady... if you want to keep out of sight.
I've had that circular for two days.
And there was a man here an hour ago that I think was your husband.
My husband!
Whoever he is, I've got the feeling he doesn't like you very much.
And if I were you, I'd keep away from cabarets altogether.
Please don't tell anyone I was here.
Don't worry. I've got a kid of my own.
85 cents.
-ls that a lot of money?
-No. I'm going to pay it right now.
I'm afraid I can't pay this.
-Why not?
-l haven't any money.
What'd you do, forget your purse?
My little boy was hungry.
We had to eat somewhere.
What do you think this is, a free soup kitchen?
This is the third time today I've been gypped out of a meal.
And, by golly, I won't stand for any more of it.
I'm going to call up the police.
Don't call the police.
I'll wash dishes, clean up, anything.
You going to wash my dishes?
Go back and see the cook.
Come on, Johnny.
I'm going to show you a nice, big kitchen.
Won't that be fun?
-Can I take my sucker along?
-Of course you can.
Vagrancy, Your Honour.
Charged with vagrancy?
Guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Not guilty?
is this your first offence?
$30 or 30 days.
I can't pay the fine.
Please don't send me to jail.
I have a boy, 5 years old.
At the Plantation Hotel.
Who's with him?
He's alone. I left him asleep.
A woman who leads the sort of life you do has no right to the custody of a minor child.
I do the best I can.
I haven't been able to find work in days.
I suspend sentence on condition that you leave the city within 24 hours.
JUDGE: Take her out. BAlLlFF:
Come on, beat it.
That dame looked like the Venus woman.
I don't see any resemblance.
She's got a kid, too. I've got a hunch.
I'm going to follow her.
Wake up, Johnny.
Where we going, Mummy?
Help me, Johnny.
-There's that man out there again.
-What man?
Just a white man that's been snooping up and down the street... for the last couple of days.
-Where is he?
I meant to tell you about him last night, but I guess it slipped my mind.
Try and find out what he wants, Cora.
Yes, ma'am. I'll find out right away.
-Are they after us again?
-l don't know, Johnny.
Howdy, boss.
-Hello, auntie.
-Looking for somebody?
No, nobody in particular.
Why? I knows everybody in the street and thought maybe I might be able to help you out.
No, I wasn't looking for anybody.
Just browsing around.
Thanks just the same.
Just browsing around.
Yes, boss, I can see that.
Just browsing around.
What did he say, Cora?
He says he ain't lookin' for nobody, he's just browsin' around.
But he can't fool me, no sir.
That white man's up to something.
I know when a white man's browsing and when he ain't.
I'm going out a bit.
Don't let anybody near Johnny. I've locked him in.
There ain't nobody going to get by me.
Terribly warm today, isn't it?
Warm?
It's hot.
You look as cool as a cucumber.
What will you have, folks?
I'll have some beer, cold beer.
Make it two.
What are you doing down here, big boy?
You don't look like the kind of a man who comes down this way.
Cigarette?
I might ask you the same question.
You don't look anything like these other women.
Give me time.
Couple of schooners.
There you are.
Why don't you tell me what you're doing here?
I'm not doing much of anything. On the level, I'm not.
Quit your kidding.
You've never had an idle day in your life. I can tell.
You're a man who's been up and around.
A go-getter, that's what you are.
Say, you're a pretty smart girl, aren't you?
Am I?
What kind of business do you think I'm in?
Rich man, poor man, beggar man.
-Thief.
-You're getting hot.
Doctor, lawyer....
But I know it's something very active and exciting.
And a little dangerous, too.
I got to hand it to you, baby, you almost hit the nail right on the head.
Who are you after, a bank robber?
Just a woman and a kid.
But she's given us one of the longest and toughest chases we've ever had.
How do you know she's in this neck of the woods?
I know, all right.
I got the whole border covered.
She hasn't got a chance in the world.
You say she got away from you before.
Yeah, I'll have to hand it to her.
I had her all sewed up in Baton Rouge, or at least I thought so.
But she leaves a hot trail behind her.
The faster she has to travel, the faster she has to work.
You ought to hear some of the suckers squawk.
She takes them like Grant took Richmond.
I was only one day behind her in Savannah.
Well, she had a bit of a rest, anyway.
You sympathise with her, don't you?
Well, I don't. She ought to get wise to herself.
The way she's living now isn't doing that kid any good.
Some people might call it mother-love, but I don't.
What does a man know about mother-love?
Come on, let's go.
That's just what I was thinking.
I'm getting sick and tired talking about that dame.
Got anything to drink at home?
You better take something along.
Hello, auntie.
Yes, boss, I can see that.
-Make us a couple of highballs, auntie.
Mind if I take off my coat?
No, make yourself at home.
What's the matter, baby?
Did I hurt your feelings?
I haven't got any anymore.
You mustn't talk like that.
You seem to be in an awful hurry.
Well, I ain't exactly got a lot of time on my hands.
That's your bedroom?
Want to see it?
I'll show it to you.
Nobody's going to bite you.
Say, who you got in there?
What are you trying to do, frame me?
-Hello, Mummy.
-Hello, Johnny. I'll be right with you.
All right, Mummy. I'll wait.
Say, is that your kid?
I'll give you three guesses, Sherlock Holmes.
You're Helen Faraday!
What a brain!
What a chump I was.
You pegged me right off the bat, didn't you?
Yes, I pegged you right off the bat.
You've got your badge on your face, not under your coat.
You and your whole crowd.
You could never have caught me, not in a thousand years.
And now get out.
And don't forget to tell that husband of mine that I'm giving the kid up.
Not because he hounded me into it, but because I'm no good.
You understand?
No good at all.
You get me?
No good for anything.
Except to give up the kid, before it's too late.
-Daddy!
My name's Wilson, Mr. Faraday.
I had charge of the case down here.
-ls there anything else I can do?
-No, thank you, Mr. Wilson.
When's the next train north?
There'll be a train to Washington in a few minutes.
A ticket and a half.
Section.
Johnny, wait here. I want to talk to Mother.
In this envelope are $1,500.
I've been wanting to pay this for a long time.
It's what I owe you for my life.
It would have been better, Helen, if you'd let me die.
You might as well know what that money means to me.
It represents my life work.
Had I been able to exploit it properly I could have made a fortune.
But I sold my rights and now we're quits.
Stay away from Johnny, for good.
Give him a chance to forget you.
That's the only way you can be a good mother to him now.
Johnny, will you go over and say goodbye to Mother?
Say goodbye to Mother?
Yes, Johnny.
CLERK: Will you sign your name here, please?
Daddy says I should say goodbye to you.
Aren't you coming with us?
No, dear, I've got to pack. I'll come later.
But there's nothing to pack.
Why aren't you coming with us?
I'll come later.
Be a good boy and go with Daddy.
When will you come?
Tomorrow?
Yes, tomorrow.
Gee whiz, I wish you were coming now.
CLERK: How about a pillow, sister?
HELEN: [Slurring] I don't need a pillow.
CARDPLAYERS: Go on, beat it.
Get out of my way.
Snap out of it, kid.
Maybe for you, but not for me.
Why, what's the matter with tomorrow?
I'm going to kill myself tomorrow, that's what's the matter with it.
Make a hole in the water.
Why are you going to kick off?
'Cause that's the way I feel.
Isn't that reason enough?
That's no reason for anything.
I've got a good reason.
Haven't got a dime.
Never had any money and I never will have.
is that all?
I can fix that.
Had I had time to exploit it properly, I could have made a fortune!
Queen of Hearts, that's me.
HELEN: Queen of Hearts! CARDPLAYER:
Get out of my way!
CARDPLAYER: You don't get out of here... -l'll crown you.
-Oh, shut up!
I'm not going to stay in this dump anymore.
I'm going to find myself a better bed.
Don't you think I can?
Just watch!
Hello, Townsend, how's the market?
Just flew back from Venice.
Going back to the States?
Yes, day after tomorrow.
How's the show?
It's just one of those revues.
I, for one, don't think I'll sit through it.
Say, what do you happen to know about this Helen Jones?
You don't mean to tell me you're interested in her!
I didn't say I was, did I?
They say she came over from South America about five months ago.
When she got here, she used man after man as a stepping stone.
Then all of a sudden, Paris went wild over her.
That's all I know, except they say she's as cold as the proverbial icicle.
-That's pretty cold, isn't it?
-lt's cold enough for me.
Hello, Helen.
Well, if it isn't old Nick himself.
I expected you to pop up some day.
If this is a dream, Helen, I hope I never wake up.
Let me come backstage, will you?
I seem to remember you came backstage once before.
[Singing] If the moon began to waltz
Or the sun did somersaults
Do you think I'd care or stop and stare?
I couldn't be annoyed
If the hens refused to lay
Or if bulls gave milk some way
Do you think I'd care?
That's their affair
If everyone stood on his head
And on his hands he wore shoes
I'd still eat crackers in my bed
What have I got to lose?
If you ate soup with a fork
Or if babies brought the stork
Do you think I'd care?
I'd still declare
CROWD: Bravo!
Well, Nick, did you succeed in forgetting me?
Forget you?
I should say not.
I haven't stopped thinking about you a single day since I last saw you.
How long has that been?
Must be more than a year now.
[Maid speaking in French] lt certainly is great to see you again, Helen.
How long have you been here? Thank you. I've got a million questions to ask you.
Better not ask them, Nick.
I'd rather not talk about the past.
Well, let's talk about the present.
Are you happy?
Are you in love with anybody?
I'm not in love with anybody, and I'm completely happy.
Funny, isn't it?
No, it's tragic to me.
Wish I were necessary to your happiness.
But I guess I never did mean much to you.
Maybe you did.
Anyway, nothing means much to me now.
It's better this way, no chains at all.
I haven't a care in the world.
Home, I suppose, with his father.
Say, I know you better than that.
All this is fake.
You care more about Johnny than anything else on Earth.
What if I did?
I'm going back to the States day after tomorrow.
Come with me and look up Johnny and break that crust of ice around your heart.
What's the use of talking about the impossible?
I'm not allowed to go near him.
Are you divorced?
Well, chuck all this and come back to America with me.
Come on, Helen, give me a break, too.
My life isn't complete without you.
As soon as we land, I'll manage it so you can see Johnny.
Let's forget all that.
I don't want to see Johnny again.
What for?
I'd go to pieces.
Excuse me, please, but they are calling for Madame.
It is marvellous.
The house is sold out for two months in advance.
You see, Nick?
I couldn't leave even if I wanted to.
Drop in again before you go.
I don't think I will.
As you like.
Give my regards to New York.
I'm going to reserve a cabin for you, Helen, in case you change your mind.
The boat train leaves tomorrow at midnight.
Without me.
Sorry about the pudding.
You see, I never tried making one before.
It's pretty good, Daddy, if you only eat the middle.
Johnny, do you know who that is?
No, who is it?
Do you remember Mother, Johnny?
Sure, I do. ls that her picture?
-l don't think I can do it, Nick.
-Nonsense, you've got to see him.
-What is it you want?
-My name's Townsend.
-Who?
I suppose you have a very good reason for coming here?
As a matter of fact, I have, Mr. Faraday.
Your wife wants to see Johnny.
-Where is she?
-Right outside the door.
JOHNNY: Who's that, Daddy?
It's bedtime.
Start undressing, will you, Johnny?
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
Do you mind going now, Mr. Townsend?
I'm very tired.
So you have no intention of allowing Helen to see the boy.
Look here, Faraday.
I'm going to marry Helen.
I've just read the papers.
Between you and me, I wish she hadn't wanted to come here.
But she's out there, waiting.
I've been teaching Johnny to forget his mother.
It's been a pretty tough job and I don't intend to have my work spoiled.
You're not so very well off financially, are you?
That's nobody's business but my own.
Would it be worth, let us say... $1,000 to let her see him for 10 minutes?
$100 a minute?
Surely, Mr. Townsend, you can afford to be more liberal.
I'll raise it to $1,000 a minute.
$10,000.
How about it, Faraday?
I suppose you feel pretty good the way you can throw money around.
$10,000 for 10 minutes doesn't mean very much to you, does it?
It doesn't mean anything to me. I can throw money around the same as you can.
Let her come in for nothing.
Come in, Helen.
Johnny's in the bedroom.
Gee, Mummy.
-Oh, Johnny!
-l'm glad to see you, Mummy!
Where you been, Mummy?
Daddy told me you were never coming back.
It's so good to see you, Johnny.
Johnny, you're so small and thin.
-But I'm awfully strong.
-And so dirty.
Daddy said I didn't have to wash tonight.
Do you wash yourself now?
Would you like me to get you nice and clean for bed?
Oh, boy! That would be swell.
Tell Mrs. Faraday, if you will, that I'm going back to the hotel.
I'm leaving my car for her.
There you are, Johnny, nice and clean.
-Are you going away again, Mummy?
-Of course not.
If you do, will you be back tomorrow night?
Yes, Johnny.
Please tell me a story before you go, Mummy.
You know, "lt was springtime in Germany." l haven't heard that for a long time.
-Father knows it better than I do.
-But he says he's forgotten it.
Ask him again.
Oh, Dad.
What is it, Johnny?
Mummy says you do too know the story about Germany.
-l told you I've forgotten it.
-But try to remember it.
It was springtime in Germany and you were out on a walking trip.
Well, let's see.
I was out on a walking trip with some other students... and as I remember it, I was very happy.
And then what happened?
I've forgotten.
Don't you remember you came to a dragon sitting in an automobile?
Yes, I remember that.
And you went and saw a lot of princesses taking a bath, didn't you?
Yes, I suppose I did.
What did you do then?
I told him to go away, but he wouldn't until I granted him a wish.
What was the wish?
He wanted to see me again.
You didn't want any other wish, did you?
No, I was very sentimental in those days and very foolish.
Why were you foolish?
That night you went to a theatre, didn't you?
Yes, I went to a theatre.
And then you saw Mummy on the stage and she was very beautiful.
And then your heart went like this.
I didn't know much about women in those days.
You're telling it all different.
You tell it, Mummy.
What happened when you saw him?
-l don't know, Johnny, dear.
-Don't you remember, Mummy?
I could hardly sing.
What happened then?
You could never guess.
We went walking.
Please walk, Mummy.
And then you came to a park and there was a dark tree and a yellow moon.
You're not doing it right at all.
You're supposed to kiss each other.
Better be a good boy and go to sleep, Johnny.
-Your mother's got to go away now.
-All right, Daddy.
Let me stay with you both, Ned.
That's where you belong, Helen.
Anne-Marie, you are as the nymphs.
Like them, you are lissom and could frolic in mossy glades, drink at the springs, dance naked in the moonlit summer nights.
Bacchus would have presided at the nuptials of Priapus Lestingois, and his Chloë Anne-Marie.
My good wife is quite unable to make me experience the joys of the flesh.
Must I therefore renounce them?
While the gods grant me the strength and inclination and for as long as you are indulgent, little nymph,
I shall be your grateful lover and my pipes shall sing till their dying breath, the praises of Eros.
To think the upstairs maid's soldier never says a word and the other who's just married a dumb coalman.
You are lucky, Anne Marie, but you deserve to be, because you're pretty.
- I love you, Mr Lestingois.
- And I am lucky too.
Go... go prepare the soup.
And don't forget the salt.
I won't forget!
While thinking of tonight!
Expectation is an indispensable condiment for dreary daily chores.
She's charming.
But I fell asleep last night before going to her.
There's no getting away from it, I'm growing old.
My pipes are weary and some shepherd will soon lure her with his fresher flute.
Back already?
I arrived in time for The Aspersion.
- Ernest's burial was well attended.
- He was your only friend.
- I walked around the cemetery.
- A good appetizer.
- Come with me!
- No! Come! It's time to go!
Come on!
Have you seen my tyke?
A black dog with long hair... he must've come this way.
- Dream of a time...
- Sure, sure.
...give a kiss.
The wild rose blossom feels its bud opening.
How dark it is in the valley.
Copper, have you seen my dog?
My dog... - A dog?
- A black one with frizzy hair.
What else could you have but a frizzy dog?
He just cleared out.
You better clear out, too.
Cos if you don't, I'll run you in.
Tell me sir, have you seen a dog?
I lost it a moment ago and I'm so upset;
it cost 10,000 francs.
- 10,000 francs?
- But of course! Hey, friends...
The lady lost her dog worth 10,000 bucks.
We'll look for it.
- What breed and colour?
- It's a brown Pekingese.
Don't worry, we'll try to find it for you. Thank you so much.
You look so sad, Miss.
Well, just imagine, I've lost my dog.
- How terrible.
- To say the least.
Shall we search together?
Sure.
Hop in, Miss.
Give this to the poor man;
one must always help the less fortunate.
- Why are you giving me 5 francs?
- To buy some bread.
Here's 5 francs.
Are you crazy?
Are you making fun of me?
To buy bread.
How much is Lettres d'Hamabed?
- 60 francs, sir.
- You find that expensive?
- For my purse, yes.
- You're a student?
- You like Voltaire...
- Yes.
- And with good reason.
- He's the one with good reason.
- Here. Take it.
- I couldn't!
You wouldn't deny me the pleasure.
- Yes, of course!
- Wait a second.
Here it is.
- Take this, too.
- But you don't know me!
I know you better than you imagine.
Your name is "Youth".
The next time you come, not a word of this to my wife.
- Give me that.
- I'm doing no harm.
No, but you ought to be dusting the piano.
Mrs Lestingois will complain about the dust again.
Why do you have a piano no one plays?
I know no one plays it;
we have a piano because we're respectable people.
You're eyeing the ladies.
You mustn't be, jealousy is a horrid sentiment, worthy of neither your spirit nor your beauty.
In the winter forest the birds do freeze their nests like graves amid snowy trees
April flies in on the wing
A thousand voices bless the spring
Your smile is my Spring, my heart feeling Cupid's sting
Your smile is my Spring
My Spring
Wait, wait!
Oh my goodness!
Oh, he is beautiful!
I've never seen such a perfect tramp!
But what...? But, he's crazy!
- What's wrong with him? - He's crazy... crazy.
What is it? What a crowd.
An accident.
Look there!
I've seen so many, I don't bother anymore.
He's crazy, he'll drown.
A fine example of civic courage from a man of our class.
There's a dead body.
Let me. Let me.
It's crowded here.
Let's take him to my house.
- Is it far?
- No, just over there.
What courage!
They're not taking that into my house.
Allow us to close the door.
Bring the bench, quickly. On the bench.
- It's draughty.
- That's what he needs.
It rarefies the atmosphere, but it's crowded here.
Let's go.
- You're soaked.
- You noticed.
Hold his head.
The tongue... put it out.
Not yours, his; grip it with your handkerchief.
Meantime, I'll keep up artificial respiration.
Go get monsieur's old coat and trousers from the cupboard.
Hurry!
And bring some towels.
You are a hero.
- Hitting him?
- It's good for the circulation.
- This seat was just reupholstered!
- I told you it could wait.
You've done a very fine thing.
The poor devil is breathing.
Sir, do change your clothes, or you'll catch cold.
I brought monsieur's old shoes too.
You, continue.
Slap his hands and face as much as you can!
Don't you belong to a life-savers club?
- No. Why?
- We'll petition a medal for you.
- I don't want a medal!
- Why not? You deserve one.
Quite right and we'll see to it.
I belong to a life-savers club, but,
I never saved anyone cos I never got the chance.
- You need luck.
- And you need to know how to swim.
- You never learned?
- My specialty was runaway horses.
How are you, my friend?
- Am I dead?
- You're very much alive.
This is the man to whom you owe your life.
- He did it against my will.
- He's not himself yet.
I'll just have to do it again.
- What did he say?
- He may be crazy.
- Where are you going?
- To drown myself.
- Again?
- He means it.
Not after I pulled you out.
- Why'd you pull me out?
- To save you.
It was to save myself that I jumped in. I'm sick of life.
You were probably alone;
with no one to resort to.
We'll rally round in support.
Won't we gentlemen?
Certainly, neighbour.
My wife must wonder where I am.
So I'll be on my way. See you. Bravo again.
I left my door open.
I'll see to the matter of your medal.
I'll leave you in peace now.
Now that we've met, I'm not going to abandon you.
You're no longer alone.
- Now, what's your name?
- Boudu.
- What? - Boudu!
Well, Mr Boudu, come along with me.
Undress.
Anne-Marie, fetch a nightshirt and socks from the wardrobe.
She's nice, is she your daughter?
Sit. Let me take your pants.
- I've got a cold now.
- It's your own fault.
No, it's all his fault.
I'm hungry.
We'll get you some soup and poached eggs.
I don't like soup...
and eggs hurt my stomach.
- What would you like?
- Sardines, bread and butter.
We'll get it for you.
Wait!
I'm drying you off!
I want the lady to leave.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- You want me to go?
- Yes, and faster than that.
Do as the poor fellow wants;
and open a tin of sardines for him.
- My back was turned.
- Even so, you're embarrassing him.
She's embarrassing me.
Even with her back turned, she's embarrassing me.
- My suspenders.
- They're worn out;
I'll give you some.
- No, no, I want mine.
- But, they're worn.
- They work for me!
- Ok, don't get excited.
I want my suspenders.
They're mine, my suspenders.
Here you are.
- Here's a nightshirt.
- Good, thanks.
It'll be too small.
Well, I wasn't expecting you.
- Go get one of my ties.
- No!
- Don't you want a tie?
- What is it?
It's a bit of cloth worn around the neck.
Around the neck? What for?
It's not an absolute necessity;
if you don't want one.
No, I don't want a tie.
Go fetch a pair of my slippers.
Meantime, you can wear mine.
Now try on this coat.
What a get-up; I'd never dare go out in the streets in it.
- Kids would call me scum.
Just pull your trousers up a bit.
It doesn't fit.
I'll buy you a lovely new suit tomorrow.
- One my size?
- You can choose it yourself.
- With black and white checks.
- The one you want.
- And are you paying for it? - Of course.
In that case, I'd love it.
Here are your old slippers.
- Why's she putting them on?
- Because I like to.
Can't he bend down?
She stuck her tongue out at me.
Pay no attention, she's a child.
I'm going to have to sleep out again tonight.
- Here are your sardines.
- It's about time.
- Is it all right?
- Is it dripping on the bread?
No, it's fresh butter, from Normandy.
It's much better than drippings.
Drink a bit.
- Is it good water?
- It's white wine.
What's wrong?
It stings.
- You prefer water?
- Of course.
He's already drunk enough.
Get him some water if he prefers it.
Nice and cold.
- Why is she saying, "Oh! Oh!"? - No reason, it's only for fun.
- What do you sell in your shop?
I sell books. I'm a bookseller.
Can you read?
A little... big letters.
I hope we're not going to keep that dirty beggar here.
I don't at all know where I'm going to sleep tonight.
Give him 5 francs for a hotel.
- A hotel? Never!
- The water!
- Why? - I'll never go to a hotel again.
You don't like hotels?
Why didn't you let me drown?
We'll make up a bed for him on the divan.
You're the master of the house.
Is she your wife?
- Is she your wife?
Yes, that's Mrs Lestingois.
He's on familiar terms with you now?
Do you mind?
Not at all.
Because I like you!
Her twitch is acting up.
Seriously, Edouard, what are we going to do with this man?
Seriously, Emma, I've no ideas yet.
I'm embarrassing you.
I can tell.
Some dosh!
They're lottery tickets I forgot in the pocket of the coat.
- Lottery tickets?
- Yes. I don't recall when I bought them.
Yes, it was with Ernest.
- Poor Ernest.
- Yes, he's dead.
- He's dead?
Ernest?
- Yes. He's lucky.
Come, Anne-Marie, it's nearly dinner time.
Set a place for my friend Boudu to dine with us.
- No, I'm no longer hungry.
- You must eat.
I'll give you one ticket and I'll keep the other.
You could win 100,000 francs.
Can you see yourself with 100,000 francs?
What would you do if you won 100,000 francs?
I'd buy a bicycle.
- Can you ride a bicycle?
- How, when I've never learned?
Where has that creature got to?
What are you doing there?
- Where are you going?
I'm not going anywhere.
Going to that girl downstairs?
Why aren't you asleep?
I can't sleep in a bed;
it's too hot.
It's too soft and I hate sweating between sheets.
Don't you?
I think the bed is a marvellous invention.
- Go to bed, then.
- I am going to bed.
Rosie!
- What?
- Have you any matches?
- Thanks.
You don't need them?
Tell me, Edouard, did you know that Ernest had a mistress?
I hope so for his sake.
Naturally, you approve.
And you didn't even come to his funeral.
You won't choke with emotion.
I have quite enough choking with my asthma, thank you.
But you were his friend.
Not going to his funeral means nothing.
I was his friend and he knew it.
- I just don't understand you.
- So you noticed?
- Why did you cry the day he died?
What are you doing?
Luckily, I'm no longer thirsty.
Why did you put salt on the wine?
Because you made a stain...
it's to draw out the wine.
She's nice, your wife.
- I leave you to your friend.
- You bug me.
- What are you doing?
- It's to draw out the salt.
Instead of singing, you'd better help Anne-Marie.
Let me take those.
- Don't forget about Judge Rougier.
- Judge Rougier? You're to deliver the works of Baudelaire.
- Where does he live?
- The address is in the ledger. What time is it?
The oaf!
I'd better go.
- Fine mess you made.
I've had enough!
Help me pick them up.
It's your fault, too. Why did you ask me the time?
- Just for a laugh.
- I'm not laughing.
I didn't think you'd drop the tray to take out your watch. It's broken.
- Did you wind it?
- I wind it all the time.
You wind it too much.
When monsieur gave it to you, he said to wind it only once a day.
He gave it to me because it's broken.
Think so? He wore it when he jumped in the water.
- You forget it was to save you.
- He could've taken it off. He'd not have thought of it.
It's always the same; everyone takes advantage of him.
And that man. What a beast!
Boudu!
- Did I spit again?
- Yes, you know how I detest that.
- You have a handkerchief, right?
- I have a handkerchief. Use it for goodness sake.
Use it. - I thought it was for nose- blowing.
- It's also for spitting in.
And afterwards?
What do you do with it?
- Put it in your pocket.
- But that's dirty. Less dirty than spitting on the ground.
Anyway, you'll do as I say.
Don't lose your temper; I'll spit wherever you say.
- What now?
- He's tickling me!
- Who me?
- Yes, you!
- Boudu.
- What?
You must mend your ways, my friend.
You must mend your ways, my friend.
Boudu.
Where did you spit?
I didn't spit. You must have spit on the floor.
I didn't spit.
It seemed so to me.
No, no, let me go.
Stop fooling around.
He's not very serious, Mr Lintesgois.
Who's that?
Mr Lintesgois;
he makes me laugh, that lad.
He's a maniac, Lintesgois.
Lestingois.
- What did I say?
- Lintesgois.
You should at least know your benefactor's name.
It's such a long name.
This is dirty;
it should go to the laundry.
Boudu.
What a pig!
So you don't find him serious?
First of all, he'd never seen me before.
So why did he fish me out?
I can't think why.
Maybe he needs a servant.
I'd like to understand.
Stop playing around!
I'm all wet! If it was thanks monsieur wanted, he got short-changed!
Lestingois.
Lestingois.
- You don't say thank you?
- Leave me alone for once!
It would deprive you to say thank you.
- I've never thanked anyone. - I guessed as much.
- Did you guess all by yourself?
- All by myself.
- Do you eat well here?
- Yes, I eat well.
- You sleep here, too?
- Yes, I sleep here, too. And you look good in your nice suit?
Yes, I look good in it.
And to whom do you owe your enjoyment of all these comforts?
To God. - What if monsieur hadn't saved you?
- I'd be in heaven.
Suicides don't go to heaven. You don't know religion and you're ungrateful!
Me, ungrateful?
- Do you want me to kiss you?
- Don't get carried away.
- Do you know how to kiss?
- I don't.
- Would it be your first kiss?
- No, I used to have a dog.
A dog?
He kissed me.
- He licked you?
- He licked me.
- And you kissed him?
Did you enjoy it?
- You could kiss me.
- What became of your dog?
I don't know; he disappeared.
- Maybe you didn't kiss him well.
- Oh, I kissed him well.
- Do you want to kiss me?
- I don't like men with beards.
Want me to cut it off?
Yes, cut it off;
then we'll see.
- Then you'll kiss me? - We'll see... if I like you.
Do you like me now?
You're crazy.
- The barber must cut your beard.
- Why? - You're uglier than before.
- Kiss me now.
Don't touch me or I'll call Mr Lestingois!
- What's the matter?
- I wanted to kiss her.
And I didn't want him to.
Your beard is lopsided.
She said she'd kiss me if I'd cut it off.
- Did you promise?
- No, I swear.
Here's money for the barber; get him to shave you.
You're not going out like that, are you?
Your shoes aren't polished.
- Cos my shoes aren't polished?
- Of course, you fool.
You aren't angry with me, are you?
- Why should I be?
- I never see you at night now.
How can I see you with that creature about?
He can't hold his tongue.
I'm sure you're no keener than I, for madame to find out about our nightly meetings.
It's all so sad.
I'm bored all alone in my room.
You don't think my thoughts exactly frolicsome, do you?
Do you regret having saved him?
At night, yes.
What am I doing?
I'm getting upset.
What about your delivery to Judge Rougier?
What a beast.
I'm off to the barber.
Are your shoes polished?
You bet they're polished.
Edouard!
- Know what Boudu's done now?
- What has he done now?
He's left the kitchen tap on.
- Really?
- The room is flooded.
What is it now?
Your friend Boudu!
I'm tired of laughing things off;
he'll have to go at once!
I told you so.
Nothing can be done with this creature!
I told you so the first day.
One should help only one's own kind.
You'd certainly be better rewarded.
But what will become of him?
I hope that's no longer your concern.
But I am still concerned.
He may disgust me, but I did give him his life back.
I'm a sort of godfather to him.
Off on your high-flown talk again.
After another futile sermon, you'll let him stay.
I said he must go and he will tomorrow.
What is it?
He spat in Physiology of Marriage.
The pig!
Even if it takes my boot on his backside, he'll have to go.
There's no need for brutality;
it won't take me long to tell him.
- He spat on Balzac.
- He respects nothing.
- And a magnificent edition, too.
- I'm not surprised.
I simply wouldn't have believed it!
This is the reward for your devotion.
You seem angry, Mr Lestingois;
not with me, I hope.
No, you know how much I enjoy your presence.
But Boudu's always between us now.
Not for long, I promise.
- Really?
How wonderful!
I thought you loved him.
- Boudu?
I'll love you all my life.
Of course, but you might have...
loved him too. At the same time as you?
I'm off, or you'll make me cry.
Tears make you look so pretty that I'd have no regrets.
I'm quite exhausted.
Been to the barber?
Very nice.
- Madame has something to say to you.
- To me?
The man who spat in Balzac's Physiology of Marriage,
- means nothing to me.
- Who is that man?
Go and ask my wife.
Where is she?
So there's another spitter, is there?
Don't be stupid;
I want to talk to you.
I smell nice, don't I? Yes.
You've been to the barber?
Do you like me now?
- Me, Mr Boudu? - Yes, you.
- Don't be so familiar.
- What are you saying?
Listen to me, Boudu.
We, Mr Lestingois and I, are your benefactors.
Yes, I know. I know.
You do not seem fully aware, of the obligations inherent in your situation.
What is she saying?
You come into an honest, middle class family, and start behaving like a caveman!
In cleaning your shoes, you made complete pandemonium of my room!
- Panty yummy yum?
- Don't be funny!
It's disgraceful!
Can't you clean your shoes properly?
How's that?
Everything you need is in the kitchen!
- Polish?
- There's polish in the kitchen!
I don't like polish. No, you prefer my satin quilt!
It's disgraceful!
- I won't do it again.
- Too late!
- What's that you have there?
- What?
- I don't know.
- Here? A beauty spot.
What was I saying?
I don't know. Why do you have a mark like that?
Let's stick to the point.
I like you, Emma.
Please, do not forget to show me the proper respect.
- I'll give you respect.
- What's gotten into you?
! Why are you making these faces?
You're frightening me!
- Afraid, Emma?
- Yes, I'm afraid!
Victory, dear neighbour! Victory!
It's done!
You've been decorated!
For rescuing Boudu; it will be announced tomorrow.
Ridiculous; anyway, I didn't make a formal written request.
I and madame signed it, as a surprise for you.
A forgery.
Now I'm simply going to look ridiculous.
Your master has been decorated for his good deed.
It's done; your husband has been decorated, thanks to me.
Have you really been decorated?
- Apparently so.
- Thanks to me!
Let me embrace you, dear benefactor.
A good deed's never wasted;
let's drink to it.
Let's go.
Excuse me, my friend, I can't see Mr Lestingois; is he out?
Lestingois? Aren't I alive?
A while ago I asked him, for a popular first edition of The Flowers of Evil.
This isn't a flower shop, it's a bookseller's.
I'll look in again.
The flowers of evil.
- Tell me, Anne-Marie.
- What?
- Did you see that client? - Which client?
- The one who just left. - No, I've just arrived.
What of him?
You should have seen me deal with him.
I could be a bookseller if I wanted.
A bookseller who'd never passed any exams.
- Where would you sell books?
When I tire of being sensible, I'll think of you.
I want it to be now.
- I've a present for you.
- What is it?
The lottery ticket monsieur gave me the day he fished me out.
He gave it to you, so keep it.
I love you, so what's mine is yours.
You love me?
Lucky me! Don't you want to be my little wife?
When there are 2 Sundays in a week.
- Alright; will that be soon?
- Wait and see.
- You're making fun of me?
- You've finally noticed?
You're a bad girl.
Complete list of winning numbers in the Colonial Exhibition lottery!
Is it you, Mr Lestingois?
Hey, what's this number here?
It's 346.
- And this one?
- It's also 346.
- Is that your ticket?
- Yes, it's mine.
Then you've won 100,000 francs.
What the hell is it to you?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing. - Mr Lestingois isn't here?
- Not unless he's become invisible.
Are you afraid?
Why are you running away? Do I scare you?
Is your conscience troubling you so much?
Bad boy!
I'm not bad. Have we forgotten everything already?
Silly boy, nobody's going to hurt you.
Aren't you happy here?
Tell me. What's wrong? Answer me, darling.
What's been wrong the last eight days?
Do you flee your beloved?
There is no temptation.
What are you doing there?
My God!
If you faint, I'll slap you!
I'm so ashamed!
- Think of the scandal.
- You shut up as well.
- There are points to clarify.
- They're all quite clear enough.
I'm going to be able to marry you.
Be quiet.
The situation is perfectly clear, blindingly so, in fact.
So I shall make no fuss.
Nonetheless, morality demands the situation be put right.
Edouard, the ticket...
The lottery ticket... 100,000 francs.
You see... I won.
I won!
- So, then...
- I won.
Let us bless happy fortune, in the form of a lottery ticket which permits union between carefree youth and innocent beauty.
For once, both modern morals and laws of nature are satisfied.
Let us invite the gods to preside over the union of Priapus Boudu and his Chloë Anne-Marie.
I can't eat this without bread.
Where's Boudu? Did he run away or did he drown?
A savage!
I don't care one bit, wherever he may be.
It's his destiny, drifting with the currents.
Five minutes early, Pat.
I'll be five minutes late tomorrow night.
"Repent for your sins, ye children of darkness. "
Let me save you.
Let me lead you to the better life.
Repent! Repent!
My family made me study piano for a dozen years and I couldn't bring your breakfast.
You're great.
Piano playing.
I've got a diploma from the Paris Conservatory of Music.
And I end up on the Barbary Coast.
Yeah, I'm great.
Olive oil.
I don't think I can get it down.
Well, you better get it down and keep it there.
Greases your insides so that drinking rotgut for a living don't tear holes in your stomach.
Drink a glass of that every night before you start work.
And another thing, you're just a beginner if you see one of these suckers with a chalk mark walk around them like they were a swamp.
- You can't win anything.
And you're a cinch to get in trouble.
I'm gonna do a lot for you, honeybunch.
You bet you are.
- Oh, now, kid, behave yourself.
- Oh, now please, don't go and leave me.
I'm so alone, schnitzel.
Yes, well, I'll be back in just a second, baby.
Dearie, buy another bottle of wine.
Then maybe I could leave earlier.
Same old stall.
No, dearie, it's on the level this time, honest.
Same old stall, 23 skidoo, beat it.
To show you I'm on the square.
Hold it yourself.
Bottle of wine.
Oh, you darling.
I'll be right back, sport.
Watch your step, kid.
- Come here, baby. - Ah!
I knew you'd come back. I knew you couldn't stay away from your honeybunch.
My sweet man, aren't you cute.
Why you nasty old man, you ought to be ashamed of yourself at your age.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
You, a lawyer and an educated man.
"The day of the Lord approacheth.
The day of reckoning.
Repent ye, repent ye. "
Oh, Good Book, Good Book, stop it.
"Behold the time, flee from evil.
Leave this den of publicans and sinners while there's yet time.
Beware of the wrath to come. "
Oh, shut up.
I'll take that cloud-climbing, devil-knocker and wear out the wall with his head.
Now, Dad, you watch the damper, I'll get rid of him.
"For bitterly I say unto ye, ye of little faith, there shall be... "
Of course, Good Book, you're right and what you say is true.
This ain't a place to preach.
Not when business is so good.
God's word belongs everywhere and at any time.
Yeah, but it does much better at the mission.
You'll get hurt in here.
Say, can't you fellas find something better to do than to tease an old man?
I'll come over to the mission and listen to you, I promise.
God bless you, Jenny.
May the hand of the Lord ever guide you.
God bless you, Good Book.
Oh, don't stop, please.
Hey, professor, give me a chord.
Now! Come on, play me on.
You're more beautiful than ever tonight, Jenny.
How's your wife, Willie?
She's getting a divorce.
Does that interest you?
No, it doesn't interest you.
What kind of mood is your old man in tonight?
About average.
I'd better tell him about us before somebody else does.
We gotta do something to end this awful suspense, Dan.
I'll speak to him as soon as this sea cow takes her last gasp.
Marry my Jenny?
I'd rather see her married to a Hottentot.
You could go through the gutters and never find anything lower than an alley-cat piano player.
- Listen, sir, for a long...
Get back to beating that agony box.
If ever I so much as catch you looking at her again you'll go out of here in that dead wagon.
Marry my daughter, you tramp.
Is the old man looking?
Charley, look out for this a minute for me.
- I've gotta tell him the truth.
No, please.
It'll make him hate you worse than ever.
Promise you'll let me tell him.
If he's gotta be told, let me do it.
- Tonight, when we close up.
Dan.
I don't wanna go home.
I wanna see Rosie.
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah, I got her a key.
Hey, I don't wanna go home.
Where's Rosie?
Here's Rosie for you.
I didn't do so good tonight.
Maybe the big men from up on the hill are home with their wives for a change.
I did all right.
Yeah. Well, you'll do better next week.
The fleet will be in from Panama.
Good night, Rosie.
Give my best to your mother.
All right, night.
Always try to get the keys back, dear.
It cuts down the overhead.
Phone me after you've talked to him.
I won't go to sleep until I get your call.
- Good night, Jim.
- Good night, Joe.
- Turn off the lights as you go out.
- Okay, bud.
Tired?
No, not very.
Must be getting on home.
- I wanna talk to you about Dan.
- No...
Oh, no, no. Please listen.
Dan and I love each other.
More than anything in the world.
You might as well know we're gonna get married right away.
Oh, no, you're not.
Nothing can stop us.
I can.
You'd better not.
I'm not sorry.
I'm not ashamed.
I love him better than anything in the world.
Your mother I'm glad she's dead.
I'm glad she didn't live to see her own daughter...
Dan!
All we need, girls, is four walls and a roof.
Stop pushing.
We'll be up there in a few minutes.
Have you seen Dan McAIlister?
The piano player from Sandoval's?
But a lot of the missing people will turn up in a few days, I hope.
Good Book!
Go get doctor, quick.
You boys carry on the Lord's work.
And, you, don't forget the collection.
Careful of the steps here, doctor.
They haven't been fixed since the fire.
Come in, quick.
Our hearts are filled with gratitude for the man-child thou hast seen fit to bestow upon thy handmaiden.
Is he sick again?
- No, hungry.
Jenny, why don't you listen to me?
We're in no position to take care of the child.
Why don't you let me put him in an institution.
He's all I got to live for, don't you understand?
The love of a mother for her babe passeth all understanding.
We must pray, then.
We must be humble and trust that the Lord will provide.
I could go on believing that if it was only for myself, but my baby's hungry.
You just told me the Lord will provide.
Well, that may be true but this is true too:
The Lord helps him who helps himself.
I'm gonna try it out.
It may be the wrong way, but it's gonna be my way.
Shall we give him some milk?
Give him a little milk.
Now you drink it up like a great big man and we go ride on the horse, huh?
That's the way. That's the way.
Amah!
Oh, isn't that too much?
Now drink it all, baby.
You feeling better now?
It's Mr. Dutton.
Give the baby his cereal, I don't think he wants the milk.
Hello, Steve.
All in your honor?
Gee, you're certainly coming up in the world.
How big a party is it?
All right, you just leave everything to me.
Everybody'll be satisfied.
Twenty five dollars apiece and no discount for cash.
You just forget about it, they'll be there.
Half past 8 at the Poodle Dog?
Sutter 3459.
Dan, for Amah, eat just a little bit.
The ducky did.
Hortense.
You wanna work on a party tonight?
Attention.
Come here, everybody.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna propose a toast to that sterling gentleman and leading light of the bar.
One of our own boys from south of the slum.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Man who from a humble beginning worked his way through law school to become one of the most valued up-and-coming politicians.
A man who is today one of the strongest influences in our city's affairs.
I refer to none other than our honored guest of the evening.
Go, Steve Dutton.
Come on, drink.
Bottoms up.
Where is Steve?
We're gonna drink to him.
Let's have a look at him.
Look under the table, he may have slipped.
He ran out on us.
Maybe one of your girls kidnapped him, Jenny.
Go on, hunt around and dig him up.
You just leave it to me.
We want Steve!
- Hey, Steve, they're yelling for you.
- Wait a minute, will you?
Well, well, another seven.
I guess I got them hypnotized tonight, Steve.
- Well, you haven't got me hypnotized.
Let me see those dice.
Why, you yellow, cheating rat, you.
I'Il...
Stop it! Stop it!
We want Steve! We want Steve!
We want Steve!
I'm done for.
- Get hold of yourself, it was self-defense.
- But I killed him.
You did not.
Now be yourself, act natural.
You don't know, didn't see anything.
Let's get back in there quick.
Take your cue from me. Wait a second.
Act natural.
You got to, like nothing's happened.
- Oh, but I...?
- Leave everything to me.
We want...
There's the old boy now.
You've been hiding out on us.
You're four quarts behind.
We're gonna start catching up.
He's a fine guest of honor passes out on his own party.
I had to wake him up.
Come on, speech, Steve.
Come on with that speech.
Don't be afraid.
The greatest thing in the world is friendship.
Success, wealth, power, they don't mean a thing.
Because it's in friendship that we find our happiness.
And, boys and girls, I don't have to tell you that this is the happiest moment of my life.
Aye! Aye!
Gee, Steve, that was a swell speech.
I'll just sneak out and ditch this.
- Excuse me, I beg your pardon but the...
- Don't anybody try to leave this room.
There's been a murder committed here.
Ah! Murder?
Is this one of your practical jokes?
Ed Harris was killed in that other room.
Shot. We're looking for the gun.
Search everybody.
Everybody, come over on this side of the room, please.
Make it snappy. Hurry up.
I'm ticklish.
Put up your arms.
Why, I've never been so insulted in all my life.
All right, put up your arms.
The things a lady has to put up with these days.
All right, open your arms.
Gentlemen, you know I hate to do this. But it's just a matter of routine.
Sure, Pat, go ahead.
Anything to help you.
You're just wasting your time with me, Pat.
Nobody ever found anything in a newspaperman's pockets.
Go ahead, Bill, get your picture so we can move the body.
All right, coroner.
- Was I in?
As long as you and Jenny were the only people in that room I have to ask you to come down to headquarters.
- Pat, you know how I stand with the boys.
Of course, Mr. Dutton.
I didn't mean that you're going in the wagon.
Just jump in your own car and come down to headquarters.
Be as quick as you can.
You know I'm breaking rules.
Well, why can't I take Jenny down in my car with me?
Sorry, she'll have to go with me.
Of all these dames, I have to get pinched.
I apologize for breaking up your nice dinner.
Oh, you didn't break up mine, I'm just having my dessert.
You can get your black coffee and cigar down at headquarters.
Jenny, there's nothing I won't do for you.
Ditch it.
Just think, Jenny I knew your father before you were born.
When I was a flatfoot on Pacific Street, I had to pinch him a couple of times.
Took plenty of help.
So you just went in that room and found Mr. Dutton asleep.
Must have been hard to awaken.
Just an average drunk.
How long would you say you were in that room, Jenny?
Oh, a couple of minutes.
He was half asleep when I got him on his feet.
And the only time you saw Ed Harris was in the banquet room.
Then I suppose it's just another one of those 1 o-cent mysteries.
Oh, hello, Tom.
- Hello, Steve.
Do I have to use a police force to get you to call on me?
Oh, I've been kind of busy.
You know how it is.
Well, it's a fine end to a party.
Just one of those things.
Now I'm here, what do you want me to say?
Well, there isn't very much for anyone to say except, good night.
The little lady here tells a very straight story.
So you get me all the way down here just to throw me out.
Well, it's getting late and I don't wanna inconvenience you anymore.
Anything I have to know, I'll phone you.
I'm still doing business at the same old stand.
- Come on, Jenny, I'll drive you home.
Wait, Steve.
Don't be selfish.
Don't take Jenny away from me.
We were just talking about her father.
I'm an old friend of the family's.
Well good night, Jenny. I'll ring you up soon. Thanks, Mr. Dutton.
Don't get yourself tangled up in any breach of promise.
Well, if I do, I'll be smart enough to hire you to defend me.
- Good night, Steve.
Why did you kill him?
I didn't kill anybody.
- Who did, then?
- I keep on telling you I don't know.
Well, I know.
You were the only one in that room with Harris.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Mr. Dutton was there.
What are you trying to do? Hang it on Dutton?
You keep on forgetting what I said.
Mr. Dutton was asleep.
Did Harris commit suicide?
What did he kill himself with? A champagne cork?
That gun was never fired.
Why ask me? You're the detective.
Oh, you're gonna get fresh.
Well, listen, sister. By your own admission, you were the only one in that room awake.
And you didn't see anything.
Won't it be great when you tell that to a jury?
I could hear the prosecutor now going way back into your beginnings.
Jenny Sandoval, the Barbary Coast.
He'll start with your father, the toughest, no-good, murdering rat.
You gotta frame a case against somebody and I'm a cinch to convict.
The taxpayers will howl for action.
Think you can throw my body to them, keep them quiet.
- Why did you kill him?
- You haven't got a case.
You're trying to make one.
Trying to look like you was earning your salary.
You're just as good as convicted now.
Say, who do you think you're bluffing?
I've been brought up with coppers.
This is Jenny, see?
Jenny Sandoval.
Convicted on what?
All right, Jenny.
It's all in the fun.
Matron.
Matron!
- Has Mr. Dutton phoned yet?
Why can't I use a phone?
I'm not gonna jump out the window.
Dearie, I told you.
Captain Davis' orders.
I can't do anything about it.
But my family.
I've been here all night, they'll think I've been killed.
No, they won't.
Look at your free advertising.
Sure took his time.
As long as Mr. Dutton is your lawyer, you have nothing to worry about.
I thought you'd never come.
It's almost noon.
I know, but I had to pull plenty of strings.
After all, murder is mixed up in this.
- Am I sprung?
All taken care of, they're just signing the bond.
Say, Jenny, why didn't you ever tell me that you had a child?
- What's happened? Tell me.
- Wait a minute.
The kid's all right.
This morning, I'm sitting in a certain big guy's office, I'm tipped off.
Children's Welfare League is gonna take that baby away.
But they couldn't take Dan away.
Sure they can. You know, Jenny, the same old story the game you're in.
Unfit person to raise a child.
And this Harris killing is gonna bring the reformers down on top of you like hounds.
Oh, Jenny, why didn't you tell me about the kid?
I could've smothered this thing before it started, but...
Come on, Steve, take me home, quick.
Now, don't go crazy, Jenny.
They can't just snatch the kid.
It'll take them days to get a court order, by that time I'll do something.
Amah?
They haven't had time to get a court order...
Trying to save your life, I've lost my baby.
They've taken my baby.
Get him back.
Get him back, do you hear?
- Don't stand there.
Get him back.
- Wait a minute, Jenny.
Stop yelling, will you?
Be calm.
I'm gonna do everything that's humanly possible.
Oh, do something.
Douglas Five-o.
That you, Jerry?
Get ahold of Judge Lang for me, quick.
I'll hold the wire.
I know he's in court, send somebody after him.
Don't argue with me, I know what I'm doing.
- Amah, where's the baby?
- The baby's all right, Miss Jenny.
- I took him. He's all right.
- Never mind. I'll call you back.
- He's with my people in Chinatown.
This morning, I heard there were two men around asking questions about you and Dan.
I'd read the papers, I called up the jail, they wouldn't let you come to the phone.
The janitor said those two men looked like coppers.
I was responsible for the baby, I couldn't take any chances.
- You did just right.
Very smart.
Yes, but I'm out now and I want my baby.
Come on, Amah, let's get him.
- Are you Jenny Sandoval?
I'm Miss Clark from the Children's Welfare League.
We have a court order to take your child.
My child?
Somebody must be kidding you.
I haven't got any child.
My hands are tied.
This Children's Welfare League is not a political thing, I can't touch it.
All right, I'll sneak the kid into Mexico. Anywhere out of the state.
It's tough, but you can't sneak yourself out of the state.
First false move you make, back you go into that can.
Remember, you're out on bail.
I've got a way out and it's perfect.
I know some fine people over in Oakland.
Thomas B. Reynolds and his wife.
They're old friends of my family and they're sort of under obligation to me.
He's a retired lawyer.
Rich, respectable, marvelous people with everything in the world you could offer a kid.
I can put Dan over there and leave no trail.
- You trying to make me give Dan up?
- Oh, not for long.
Just till this heat blows off.
Nothing permanent.
As soon as it's safe, we get him.
- You'll have him back.
- Don't even talk about it.
Will you listen to reason, Jenny?
This is the luckiest break in the world.
These people have no children, they've always wanted a child.
They're able to give Dan everything you could hope for.
A chance in life that you could never give him.
I'm not listening to you.
You better think it over, Jenny.
Where would you rather have him?
In a family like that? In the cellars of Chinatown? Or in an orphan asylum?
Miss Jenny, where do you get this delicious coffee?
Special Goldberg, Bowen.
It's delicious.
I must get some for my girls.
They're inveterate coffee drinkers.
Why they're almost addicts.
That's less injurious than opium, my dear.
Amah, some more cakes.
By the way, how is dear Edith?
Treatments made a new woman of her.
I suppose she lost a lot of time.
She hardly left her bed the whole time she was ill.
Well, ladies, let's combine business with pleasure.
My, my, how quickly the first of the month rolls round.
Business was very gratifying this month.
Conventions always help.
You'll find that a couple of hundred dollars short.
- You know, breakage.
- Can't say I didn't tell you about gilt furniture.
That's right. I remember Miss Jenny warning you the day you bought it.
It simply won't stand the wear and tear.
I had to take that gilt divan out of my Turkish room.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Tessie.
- Say, you're late.
- I just couldn't help it.
Been having the most marvelous sales at the City of Paris.
Practically giving things away in the linen department.
All right, ladies, that's fine.
Thanks for being prompt and prosperous.
Maybe we better leave one at a time.
- Well, goodbye, Miss Jenny.
Had a lovely time.
You remember Hortense? I do.
Such a refined girl.
I understand she's in Shanghai with Rosie, they're inseparable.
My goodness.
Can't you ladies talk of anything else?
Why the hurry call?
More trouble?
No trouble at all.
The world's bright for the first time in three years.
I got a present for you, Steve.
You were kind enough to help me when I didn't have a cent there's the money I owe you.
Oh, I can't take this.
You told me I'd never owe you unless I had it.
- Now I got it and plenty more.
- Here, keep it.
I set myself a certain amount, the day I got it.
For three years, I've counted the dollars because each one brought me nearer to Dan, to get him back.
Now we're going to a foreign country to live.
I'm gonna change my name.
Paid a murderous price, Steve.
But I got Dan.
- Jenny, are you through?
- Yup.
No more sneaking around trying to get glimpses of him.
Looking at him over fences and through windows.
All of him.
Janet, I know it's a hard thing to bear, the boy has meant so much to us.
There's no question as to her claim.
Must you take him now?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Reynolds, yes.
Go to your mother, Dan.
Mama, why are you crying?
Now listen, Dan.
You're a great big man now.
And well, you're going away for a while.
- Military school?
Not right now.
You're going on a fine trip on a big steamboat.
Way across the ocean.
You'll have all kinds of fun.
It'll be great.
Are you and Mama going with me?
You're going with your mother.
Your real mother.
Don't you remember me at all?
You aren't my mother.
Mama, I don't know that lady and I'm not going with her.
Please don't let her take me away.
- I wanna stay here with you and Papa.
I'm ashamed of you.
That's no way for a great big man to act.
I won't go with her.
I don't know her and I don't like her.
I wanna stay here.
Never mind.
I'll never bother you again.
Can I?
Well, Jenny.
Now what?
When I said I was through, I guess I was just kidding myself.
Steve, he's wonderful.
Born in a cellar under a fish market, but a gentleman, Amah.
A real man.
Nothing beyond his reach.
District attorney governor even president.
Confucius says:
"Fortunate is the mother of a man-child. "
- Will you see Mr. Weaver?
Lock this up, Amah.
- Hi, Jenny.
- How are you, George?
Never better.
One hundred G's.
- Everything is represented?
- Tallied to a bottle.
Five thousand cases at 2o a case.
- Have any trouble?
- I never do with your stuff.
- Guess I'm lucky.
- No just acquainted with the right boys and girls.
Say, by the way, that Tom Ford's a honey.
He made everything awful easy.
Take it from me, this will be the rightest town in America after we elect him DA.
Suppose you boys will stick together.
Anyone in our crowd doesn't vote at least three times for him is a traitor.
- You think Reynolds hasn't got a chance?
- No, not a smell.
He'll get one vote.
His own.
- How was it, Georgie?
- Just a pushover.
I'll give you a check.
No hurry. No hurry at all.
Tom Ford helped a little, didn't he?
All $5ooo worth, I should say.
It'll pay for the party he's giving tonight.
- Stag? - Mm-hm.
For about a dozen of his staunchest admirers.
I think I'm guest of honor.
Guest of what?
I knew Tom helped out on the deal because he said he was coming up to see you this afternoon.
- Here are his cigars.
What a cute little district attorney old Tom is going to make.
I wonder if this funny old world ever saw anything so topsy-turvy.
Jenny Sandoval's son running against Jenny Sandoval's pet politician.
The gods must all be out to lunch.
Why shouldn't Dan run for district attorney or anything else?
There's only one hurdle that can throw him.
Me. So he's safe.
Mr. Ford.
Tell him to come right in.
Well, well, well, if isn't my old pals, Jenny and Steve.
- Hello, Tom.
- How are you?
How did that little matter progress this afternoon?
- Smooth as a river of oil.
- I don't know what we'd do without you.
If I've been valuable with my limited opportunities imagine what I'm gonna be after I get in.
Why, you'll be able to use the city hall for a kennel.
I know that, Tom.
Isn't that a box of your favorite cigars?
Corona coronas.
What a bouquet.
But don't open that till you get home.
That bouquet might drop out and bite you.
Jenny, I know you'll excuse me if I have to rush along.
Gotta address the Women's Better Government League at 5:oo.
The Women's Better Government League?
You're sensational.
I've gotta be.
Reynolds has been accusing me of every crime in the book.
I gotta salve those old crows. The first thing I do when I get into office will be to put that young dude right out on the sidewalk.
Once I get into office, I'll blast Mr. Reynolds right out of this town.
If he stole so much as an apple, I'll broadcast it.
If he didn't, I'll invent something. Dig him up back to the cradle.
He'll learn a lesson to leave old Tom Ford alone.
So the mud is gonna fly, huh?
You bet.
Well, so long, Steve.
So long, Jenny.
See you tonight, Tom.
- I almost forgot, my party.
Jenny, will you dig me up about a dozen young debutants to liven up the gathering tonight?
Well, you see, Tom, I haven't been in contact with the 4oo for a long time.
But you call up Fremont 7495 and mention my name.
You're a pal, Jenny. A real pal.
You know, there's one thing that always touches old Tom Ford right here.
And that's loyalty and friendship.
- Well, so long.
Good night, Tom.
Well there goes our next district attorney.
Don't go to that party.
Oh, why not?
I got a silly hunch that you might not like it.
- Come on, have dinner with me.
- All right, Jenny, it's a pleasure.
Still get my coffee from Goldberg, Bowen.
And it's still delicious.
Oh, by the way, Tessie has the Honorable Thomas Ford telephoned you?
- Just a few minutes before you blew in.
- That's what I came to see you about.
You don't have to worry.
I'll give his party special attention.
No, Tessie, that isn't what I mean.
You and I have been pals for a long time.
Right out of the same gulch on the Barbary Coast.
- You'd do me favor, wouldn't you?
- You name it and I'll do it.
You know that, without asking.
Any of the ladies around here blessed with a good loud voice?
I don't get you.
The girl whose voice could be heard across a bay.
Well, now let's see, there's Beatrice, Winnie Marie, when she whispers you get a headache from the noise.
Her mother must've been a siren on a lighthouse and her father a locomotive whistle.
Now, listen.
Murder! Ah!
How should I know what he was doing?
Yelling out the window.
You could hear her a mile.
No, you dope.
Not Henry Ford, Tom Ford.
Give me the City Desk quick.
Extra, read all about it!
Tom Ford exposé.
Extra paper!
Tom Ford out of district attorneys' race.
Read all about it. Extra! Extra!
- The bridge.
Looks like a washout.
The bridge is all right.
This looks phony.
Get them up, boys.
All right, put them up there.
Put them up.
Pick them up.
Come down out of there.
Pick them up.
Turn around, come on.
Drop those guns.
Turn around.
- Are we hijacked?
- Pinched.
- Pinched?
Why, you're daffy.
- Am I?
What's the matter? Has America declared war?
- No, but the new district attorney has.
Amah, you got all the trunks up?
I'll bring the rest up this afternoon.
Jenny, pay some attention to us.
We just blew 5ooo cases of merchandise and you sit there cool as a cucumber.
I didn't blow anything.
I haven't been interested in merchandise for over a month.
You and Steve went into this deal on your own.
We know that, Jenny.
But whenever anything came up, you could see a way out.
It's a cinch you can help us now.
Georgie, dear, you're talking to a lady who's quit.
I was always a hunch player and I had a hunch we were gonna get awful unlucky.
That's why I quit after election.
- We'll take care of it ourselves.
- Wait a minute.
You pushed the law out of your way around this town for over 2o years.
You were a champion.
You mean to tell me that this prosecutor's got you buffaloed.
Are you gonna tell me that Jenny Sandoval can't reach that squirt?
Georgie, I'm only interested in reaching Paris, which is in France.
I'm going out to buy Amah and me a one-way ticket that long.
I've retired, I'm through.
It's goodbye merchandise, San Francisco, everything.
Make yourselves at home, boys. Toodle-loo.
Looks like we're out on a limb.
- That stuff isn't lost, it's in a warehouse.
A smart guy by the name of Reynolds is holding the key.
Well, it's a cinch Jenny isn't gonna help any.
She's probably got her own reasons.
That's not gonna stop me from trying, come on.
Now, Mr. Reynolds, I realize we've been at cross-purposes.
I'd have come to see you sooner, but you were busy getting settled in your new offices, so I waited until I could see you privately.
- What do you want me to do, Mr. Dutton?
- Well, 15 of my boys are in jail.
And 5ooo cases of excellent liquor are in our warehouse.
And I'm prepared to make a most generous gesture to get them out, Mr. Reynolds.
Do you smoke cigars?
- No, no, thanks.
- Oh, I think you'll like these.
There's $ 1 o, ooo in United States currency in this box, Mr. Dutton.
Well, the cigar store man must have wrapped up my change by mistake.
- And you still want me to keep this?
- Did you get all that, Pat?
Here's Exhibit A.
Well, you've copped my jack, but I've still got an ace.
You're gonna need it when I get you and Jenny Sandoval on the witness stand.
I don't think she'll testify, besides she's not my partner.
But it happens that I have photostatic copies of several large checks she made payable to you.
The jury might be interested in the connection between you and the most notorious woman in town.
You'd better go slow you're putting yourself on the spot, my boy.
I'll risk it.
Money, won't touch you, eh?
But you can be stopped.
Make out a warrant for Steve Dutton's arrest: Bribery. That'll do to start with.
You'll only be sorry once and that'll be all your life.
Fifty thousand dollars' bail for a little thing like bribery.
Well, all bail is going up.
Dan Reynolds is gonna make a millionaire out of me.
You get it while you can, he won't be in there very long.
- Gotta go to him.
You gotta talk. - I won't do it.
Are you gonna let him push me into the penitentiary?
Don't you realize he's got me tied hand and foot.
I can get 1 o years, but you can save me with a word.
I won't do it. I won't do it.
We've been partners for 2o years. Sharing each others dough.
The first time I get in a jam, you step away.
You expect me to dynamite my son's career?
- One little whisper in his ear and he'll stop.
- Not a chance.
So your mind's made up, eh?
My mind has been made up since I left him in Oakland.
Do you think it's been easy for me to give up my son?
Never to see him, never to be with him?
But I stood it, didn't I?
Because I knew just being near him was a menace.
I was the one thing that could ruin him.
But I didn't do it, did I?
Now that he's become somebody, you expect all my suffering to go for nothing?
- Well, if you don't tell him, I'm going to.
- No, you're not.
District attorney's office.
Let me speak to Mr. Reynolds.
This is Steve Dutton.
Don't, Steve, stop it! Stop it!
Tell him I'm coming down there, I got a very important statement.
Just tell him what I said.
I don't care what he's doing, he'll see me.
Steve. Steve, you can't do it.
- Get out of my way.
- I won't let you do it. I won't...
Stop that woman. Stop her!
Stop her!
Bring her back here.
Keep her back there, boys.
She did it.
She's your...
Your...
The state's witnesses have never been shaken despite the efforts of the learned counsel for the defense.
We have the affidavit from the telephone company as to the exact time of Mr. Dutton's call to my office.
As to the import of that call you have already heard my testimony and testimony of my secretary.
Let me remind you again, that the telephone call came from the defendant's apartment.
We have proven that she was with Dutton when he called my office and must have heard his promise to bring some vital information to me.
William Mullins, the taxi driver, testified that he delivered the defendant in front of my office not over two minutes before the crime was committed.
Officers Scanlan and Verger have testified that they arrested the defendant not over 5o feet from the scene of the crime with the smoking revolver still in her hand.
I have told you how Steve Dutton died in the doorway of my office and attempted to identify her.
The evidence of guilt, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is more than complete.
Now let's look into the motive.
This will have to be done by the simplest deduction because the defendant has consistently refused to take the stand on her behalf.
This motive is childishly simple.
The defendant and Steve Dutton had been partners for years controlling together commercialized vice on which they mutually fattened.
In the roots of every slimy and degraded enterprise which has for so long disgraced the fair name of our city we have found Steve Dutton and Jenny Sandoval.
Going back over their past is like digging up carrion a stench in the nostrils of society.
The connection between these two was shown years ago in another murder.
I refer to the mysterious and unsolved killing of Ed Harris, the gambler, in 19o9.
They were the only ones present in the room of death yet they stood no trial.
Because Dutton's power even then, clogged the wheels of justice.
Crime flourishes in the dark.
In the shadow of Steve Dutton and Jenny Sandoval.
But retribution must come at last.
By my order, Dutton was finally arrested on a felony charge, his trial set.
The law was finally to collect its debt.
The penitentiary was inevitable.
Motive?
Here is your motive, ladies and gentlemen of the jury:
Panic-stricken, he phoned me said he was on his way to my office with information.
Phoned from this woman's apartment.
The tenderloin never comes bearing gifts to the prosecutor.
The cowardly criminal comes to barter and to trade.
To trade the liberty of his associate for his own.
To turn state's evidence.
What was the information so vital to the defendant that she must seal Steve Dutton's lips in death?
What crimes had she committed back through all those criminal years?
Ladies and gentlemen, give your imagination full scope.
Jenny Sandoval, look at her.
Born in the slums raised on the Barbary Coast in her father's notorious dive.
We lose her only for a moment, during the great fire.
Then we pick up traces of her in the lowest cellars of Chinatown.
From this point on, her trail is well-blazed:
Organized vice gambling halls, casinos, implication in a murder.
And after the advent of Prohibition, control of the bootlegging in this city.
Search as we will we can find no redeeming trait in this defendant's life.
No redeeming feature in her character.
Her progress in crime has been logical.
Culminating as it had to culminate, here in a court of justice.
Charged with deliberate, cold-blooded, premeditated murder.
To be by him executed and put to death on Friday, the 27th day of January, 1933.
Between the hours of 1 o a. m. And 4 p.
M within the walls of said state prison at San Quentin by hanging by the neck until you shall be dead.
And may God have mercy on your soul.
How much time we got?
Oh, about an hour.
Amah.
Amah, I'm yellow.
I'm a coward.
I can't face it.
Oh, Amah.
Amah, save me.
Save me.
The sage says:
"Death, being universal, must be a blessing. "
He said there was no redeeming trait in my life.
No redeeming feature in my character.
He was right.
I'm not even brave.
The cellars of Chinatown.
Yeah, I was there.
So was he.
It was there I gave him life.
He gives me death.
Steve said, "The gods must all be out to lunch. "
The gods see everything.
Everything in this world must balance.
The son to whom you gave life, gives you death great suffering.
He, too, must suffer.
The agony of continuing to live and learn that he has hanged his own mother.
Give me your permission to tell him.
If he knew, he might be able to help you.
This is the only chance to save your life and you refuse to take it.
You choose death.
Amah, Amah, tell him.
Tell him, quick.
No, I'll do it.
I'm glad you came, Mr. Reynolds.
I hoped you would, that's why I came.
I can't get this case off my mind. I can't forget you.
Can't you?
Why did you refuse to take the stand?
Why didn't you ever say one word in your own behalf?
Why didn't you give a reason for killing Dutton?
Believe me, Miss Sandoval, I'm trying to help you.
We might be able to reach the governor.
Get a stay of execution.
You seem anxious to undo my conviction. You worked so hard to get it.
I don't know what it is.
I just feel there's something wrong.
In court I was sure.
Now I'm not.
What was so vital in your life that you had to kill to conceal it?
- You must be shielding somebody.
Exaggerated loyalty.
There's no debt that big in the world.
You have no parents?
No brothers or sisters?
No child?
Nobody near or dear to you?
Well, if you won't let me help you...
Time's up, Mr. Reynolds.
Amah!
You didn't tell him.
And you never will.
Amah, you've been my only friend.
You've been loyal and true and devoted all these years.
There's just one more favor I must ask.
Look in the drawer of my desk you'll find Dan's scrapbook.
All Dan's pictures.
Burn it.
Don't let him trace me.
Promise you'll do it?
Are you bad luck!
Hiya, Doctor.
Hiya, babe.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Inside, inside.
No, you ain't.
Only stiffs go in there tonight.
- No kidding.
- No kidding.
- What's keeping you out?
- I'm...
- Listen, we're pals, ain't we?
- Yeah. Get a flash of that.
Yeah, well, it won't do you any good tonight.
Now, look, I got me orders.
Nobody's going in there, and that goes for you newspaper guys, too. Now...
Sergeant, all I want to do is identify a body.
Now, look, walk down the street, because somebody might think I know you.
- Go ahead.
- That's an idea. Bones.
- Hello, Dee.
- Say, say, what's the hurry, big boy?
- I just want to use your telephone.
Oh, yeah? Well, there's one down at the corner drugstore.
Listen, I haven't got time.
Will you be a sport? Come on, act natural.
All right, but step on it.
This is no telephone exchange.
Haven't I...
Say, didn't I meet you in Havana?
Hello, World?
Give me the night desk, please. Yeah.
Willard Keefe. Yeah, this is Lee Taylor.
I'm down at the Mott Street Morgue.
Just now they bring in the body of an old scrubwoman murdered under very peculiar circumstances.
No, they won't let me see it.
I can't get any dope. Police...
Very good.
I say very...
I say I can't get any dope on it.
Police orders. Just now, Stevens, O'Halloran and a guy named Dr. Xavier arrived.
- Something's doing.
- Yeah, I've heard that one, too.
Listen, you lunkhead, I'm not clowning.
Look out the window, will you?
- What do you mean, the moon?
- Certainly I mean the moon.
I'm laying 10 bucks to a dime it's another Moon Killer murder.
Now, listen, Lee, stick right on it.
I thought I...
Oh, Rachmaninoff.
How about the Prelude, huh?
Hey, Mike, just a minute.
Hello, Mike.
Hey, listen, what's going on across the street tonight?
I don't know a thing, Lee.
I'm walking my beat and minding my own business.
- Well, have you got a cigarette?
- I never use them.
Here, smoke this.
Paddy, the bartender down at the corner, gave it to me.
- Oh, much obliged, Mike. Thanks!
- Yeah, no problem.
- Good gracious!
What you got there?
- Nothing, just a little handshake buzzer.
You see, fits right in the palm of your hand.
You wind it up like that, and it discourages these professional handshakers.
I ought to have one on each hand for my beat here.
- Well, I gotta be going now.
Goodbye. - So long.
I forgot all about that thing.
Don't ever bring any of those darned tricks around here again.
What's your theory, Doctor?
Strangulation by terrifically powerful hands.
You will notice how deeply the thumbs are embedded in the sternocleidomastoid.
And what do you think of this incision at the base of the brain?
Obviously made by some type of scalpel used for brain dissecting.
But it's peculiar that this left deltoid muscle should be missing.
- It's been torn right out.
- Gentlemen, it wasn't torn.
This is cannibalism.
- This portion of the body was...
- Impossible!
There's no doubt about it.
Thank you, Doctor.
I appreciate your professional opinion.
I'm only too happy to be of any service to you, gentlemen.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have rather an important experiment in progress that demands my attention every few hours.
I hardly think I can be of any further use to you, so if you don't mind, I'm very, very sorry, but I'll say good night.
Just a moment, Doctor, if you don't mind.
- Very well, sir.
- Yes, what?
- Yes, it is peculiar, isn't it?
- Most peculiar.
- What's your theory of the killer, Doctor?
- A neurotic, of course.
- Some poor devil suffering from a fixation.
- Fixation? What do you mean?
A knot or kink tied to the brain by some past experience.
A madness that comes only at certain times when the killer is brought in direct contact with some vivid reminder of the past.
- It's hard to believe that.
- Yes, for a policeman, I suppose it is.
But I tell you that locked in each human skull is a little world, all its own.
Yes, well, what would these reminders be, for instance?
The sight of the sea, the full moon. Anything.
The poor devil, sane at all other times, is forced to live over the scene of the action that first drove him mad.
Very interesting.
Particularly in view of the fact that all these murders occur in the vicinity of your medical academy.
Are you implying that someone in my academy could have done this?
- I am convinced of it.
- This is preposterous!
I'm familiar with the character of every student and professor, and they're all men of the highest integrity.
There are other academies in the state...
But they don't have that kind of knives.
The surgical supply house swear they import them from Vienna especially for your institute.
It's the only place in the country that they're used.
Commissioner Stevens, if you jump at a hasty conclusion like this, you'll ruin the integrity of an institution that has one of the finest reputations in the world.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I have to start an investigation.
I tell you this first, because I'm hoping for your cooperation.
Naturally, I shall do everything to protect your institution.
- But the newspapers, the publicity.
- Don't worry about them.
We don't want publicity any more than you do.
If my academy is under suspicion, give me a chance to conduct an investigation of my own first.
Surely, with our knowledge of the human brain,
- we have every facility to catch a madman.
- How would you proceed?
By immediately studying the pathological reactions of every man placed under suspicion.
Then trap the guilty one by a brain examination.
May I examine the records of your students and faculty?
Why, assuredly, assuredly.
You can come to my office now, if you wish.
But, I beg of you, no publicity, please.
- No, don't worry.
- Please. Not one newspaper in the country shall hear of this until you've had every opportunity to clear your academy of suspicion.
- Oh, it's you, Joanne.
What is it, dear?
I just came in here to say good night to you.
Father, what are you doing in here in the dark?
You frightened me.
I'm sorry, Joanne.
I just came here to get those records.
You're looking very tired, darling.
You're only heading for a nervous breakdown unless...
That moon, mixed with this other light, it's too ghastly.
Father, you worry me.
You promised me you'd take a rest.
Lately you've been so...
No, my dear, I'm all right.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Now, I have some gentlemen next door in the office.
- You run along.
I'll be through shortly.
- But, Father...
Now, Joanne, please.
This is very important.
But, really, gentlemen, this investigation is useless.
The academy is closed.
The students are away on their vacations.
It surely isn't wise to spend your time on this.
Probably Professor Wells.
He's in his laboratory.
What's he doing here if the school's supposed to be closed?
It's not an unusual thing for the faculty to spend their evenings here at this time.
Vacation period is the only opportunity they have to do their personal research work.
What's the history of this man?
- I'm waiting, Doctor.
Professor Wells is a student of cannibalism.
He's written a book about it.
Why didn't you tell us this before?
It's as good as a conviction.
I hardly think so.
I'm very fond of Dr. Wells.
He couldn't possibly do a thing of this sort.
- May I talk to him?
- Why, certainly. Certainly.
Come this way, gentlemen.
What a very strange, uncanny place you have here, Doctor.
What are all these doors?
They are the laboratories of my faculty.
Dr. Wells, Dr. Duke, Dr. Rowitz, Dr. Haines.
And all those men are here at this hour of the night?
They seldom leave.
They live for their work.
After all, this is a research institute.
I should like to have a little talk with these gentlemen.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Professor Wells, but I would like to introduce some friends of mine.
- May we come in?
- Of course, of course, gentlemen.
Come in.
- This is Mr. Stevens. Mr. O'Halloran.
- Professor, how do you do?
That's interesting, isn't it?
If this experiment is successful, we will be a little nearer the secret of life.
What is that?
That's a heart.
I've kept it alive for three years by electrolysis.
Electrolysis?
Professor Wells is accomplishing remarkable findings in nerve reflexes.
- You flatter me, Doctor.
I understand, Professor, that you live just for your work,
- that you seldom leave the institute.
- Not necessarily.
I played truant a short while ago.
I was down by the waterfront for a breath of air.
- What time was that?
- You're not feeling well?
- Your arm is troubling you?
- Yes, it's very annoying.
Well, you're foolish to sit there in discomfort.
- lf you gentlemen don't mind, I...
- Why, of course not, of course not.
I put it on just as I heard you coming.
An empty sleeve is revolting to most people.
Well, I think we've taken up enough of Professor Wells' time.
- Oh, not at all, Mr. Stevens.
- Thank you, Professor.
Well, gentlemen, shall we be going?
There are many other interesting things to see.
Yes, let's be going.
Thank you for calling.
You know, this is a tough case.
There isn't much chance of his strangling anybody with one hand.
- Oh, I agree with you.
- Well, that lets him out of the picture.
- Whose room is that?
- Professor Haines'.
Is there anything about him that might justify my putting him under observation?
Well, of course, if you're just looking for someone to hang suspicion on, there's not a man on my faculty that wouldn't come under that heading.
Then, you do know something about this man Haines.
- No, not exactly, except...
- Come on, come on.
Well, what is it?
Dr. Haines and two other scientists were shipwrecked off Tahiti about a year ago while making a study of the coral reefs for the Killary Foundation.
Now what's that got to do with it?
- You say they were shipwrecked?
- Yes, they were adrift for 24 days.
Their supplies were exhausted.
When they were picked up, Haines and one other were delirious.
The third had vanished.
There was no explanation at the time.
Haines later claimed the man had died, and he had thrown the body overboard.
- I should like to meet him.
- Surely.
But I am sure that he's not the guilty party.
The killer is a maniac, and Dr. Haines is one of the most brilliant men in the medical world.
- However, if you insist...
- I do.
Very well.
Professor Haines?
Yes, yes, come in.
Come in, Doctor.
I want you to meet Mr. Stevens and Mr. O'Halloran.
They're making a tour of scientific investigation and intend to honor our academy for a short time.
- How do you do, gentlemen?
- Hope we're not disturbing you, Professor.
I was just relaxing.
Professor Haines is a most intensive worker.
I've just been telling Mr. Stevens of your phenomenal experiments in brain grafting.
Oh, Doctor, Doctor, come.
Come. I want to show you.
I want to show you a new type of brain cell.
- That should be interesting, Professor.
- I'm sure you'll find it so.
- On the slide?
Relaxing.
Why did you bring the police in here?
Get them out quickly, or I'll...
Professor, do you experiment with all these animals?
Mankind's benefactors.
Those little animals whose blood most nearly resembles the human.
Yes, yes, of course.
But it's getting rather late, Professor, and Mr. Stevens wants to see the rest of the laboratories.
Now that he's met you, he can call some other time.
- Delighted.
- Thank you, Professor.
- Glad to have met you. Good night.
Good night, gentlemen.
There's always a certain amount of danger in a laboratory so...
He's certainly a strange type.
Well, such men are naturally strange, Mr. Stevens.
Sometimes in the overdevelopment of one part of the brain, another part is weakened.
There's a type who looks capable of anything.
Oh, I assure you, he's as timid as a lamb.
He's inclined to be attentive to my daughter, so I see a lot of him.
- Who's the next?
- Dr. Rowitz.
He's the scientist who was with Haines during the shipwreck.
If you'll step this way.
- Are you busy, Dr. Rowitz?
- Always, but it's a pleasure, gentlemen.
Oh, excuse me.
Mr. Stevens. Mr. O'Halloran.
- How are you?
- Can I be of any service?
- Well, we are just looking around, Doctor.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Good evening, Professor Duke.
- How are you feeling tonight?
- Horrible.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, if it makes you feel sorry to hear things like that, then don't ask questions.
Oh, Professor Duke, Mr. Stevens, Mr. O'Halloran.
He's Dr. Rowitz's collaborator.
You're an astronomer, Doctor?
Not that, sir.
I have an interest in the light qualities of the moon.
If you might suffer sunstroke, might you not suffer some similar evil
- from the rays of the moon?
- Moonstruck, you mean?
Exactly, what we call lunacy, from the word luna, meaning the moon.
Latin, you know.
However, the luna rays will never affect you or me, sir.
- Because we are normal people.
It affects strangely certain neurotic types.
Yes, moon is powerful.
Why, twice a day it lifts billions of tons of water at high tide that wash the shores of the world, like an eternal old scrubwoman.
Pardon my poetic effort.
Yes, but just what do you mean by that?
I'm afraid we've taken up too much of Dr. Rowitz's time.
That was very, very interesting.
- Good night, gentlemen.
You know, this is the doctor's particular hour for observation, and the moon doesn't wait, you know.
Did you notice the face on that fellow?
That sailor who saw the scrubwoman killed tonight says the murderer had a face that was horribly disfigured.
Rowitz certainly fits the description, all right.
Gentlemen, I don't believe that Dr. Rowitz could commit a crime.
He has such a lovely nature.
Why, he's the author of several volumes of poetry.
- What are we gonna do?
- We're powerless unless he helps us.
You know that as well as I do.
We've exhausted every clue.
He can help us find the murderer, if anybody can.
And I'm gonna put plenty of pressure on him and make him do it.
A little nervous perhaps, but nothing more.
Oh, ridiculous.
You go back to sleep, dear.
Doctor, if I permitted you to conduct your own investigation, how long would it take you?
If you leave me alone, I can conduct a series of tests, which in 48 hours will conclusively prove whether or not the killer is a member of this academy.
In the meantime, I should like to check up on all your collaborators.
Hey, what're you doing up there?
I'm a building inspector.
I work nights so I won't get sunburned.
I asked you what are you doing up there?
I'm a somnambulist.
I probably came up here to have my head examined.
You come down from there, or I'll...
Now, just a minute, I'll be right down, honey.
Just relax.
Everything is gonna be all right and on the up-and-up.
I'm not used to these. These fire escapes are a sideline with me.
Now everything is gonna be...
There's nothing to worry about.
See, Police Commissioner Stevens is upstairs, and I'm taking care of the outside.
- By the way, what are you doing here?
- I'm Miss Xavier.
And we're not accustomed to having strange men climb all over our fire escapes.
I'm not accustomed to having strange girls sticking guns in my stomach.
By the way, you're just the person I wanna see.
I wanna ask you a few questions.
Could you tell me the whereabouts of your father during the last four hours?
How do you spend your evenings?
I mean, have you ever noticed the Doctor acting strangely?
I'm sorry, but I can't answer those questions.
The Doctor hasn't been very well lately, and I don't like policemen or anyone to disturb him.
- Just a minute.
- Have you got a permit to carry that gun?
I'll agree to lay off for 48 hours.
But I give you my word, if you don't succeed, I'll come in here, seal every door, place everybody under technical arrest, take fingerprints, conduct a rigid inspection.
I don't care if the whole world knows it.
There have been six murders committed all in the same circumstances.
The evidence points here.
- But, Commissioner, all I want is a chance.
- You've got it.
- Forty-eight hours.
Good night, Doctor.
Meddling fools.
This way out, gentlemen. If you please.
- Who're you?
- I am Dr. Xavier's butler, sir.
My nerves are all shot.
That dumb, potbellied, flat-footed cop.
I dashed that off in five minutes.
I think it's pretty swell.
- What do you think?
- It's okay.
But you stick on Dr. X's trail, and you get a picture of the Doctor and a statement, too.
Oh, no, not me.
Listen, I wanna get off this story.
Put me back on crossword puzzles, covering woman's clubs,
- anything, will you?
- Say, what's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
Nothing at all.
Only I spent all last night laying next to a bunch of stiffs, looking at a lot of goofy guys.
I let a dame poke a gun in my stomach, and then I let a dumb policeman slip me a trick cigar.
Say, you want to draw another paycheck, don't you?
Certainly, that's my aim in life, but I'd like to keep out of the bughouse to enjoy it.
Eddie, when is Lee Taylor's week up?
Oh, wait a minute.
Can't you take a joke?
All right, keep moving, but get a picture of the Doctor.
Here, have a cigar.
I'm Mr. Taylor.
- You ain't a reporter, are you? - I should say not.
Well, that's good.
We've been overrun with them all morning.
- Gee, they got us goofy.
- I know just how you feel, Miss Xavier.
- I ain't Miss Xavier.
- Well, that's funny.
I was told that she was a good-looking girl of about 20.
I'm 21-and-a-half.
Pleased to meet you.
Gee, ain't you the kidder, though.
That's another thing in your favor.
That shows that you have a sense of humor.
What do you want the miss for?
- My grandmother sent me.
- Your grandmother?
Won't you take these flowers?
- For the miss.
Miss Joan, there's a man down here wants you for his grandmother.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, how do you do?
I didn't know you...
I'm awfully sorry.
You know, I felt sure that I'd hear you coming before you entered.
Well, I suppose I could go back and cough.
Oh, no, no, please don't bother.
Stay right here.
- You're sure I'm not disturbing you?
- Not at all. Why do you ask?
You're so obviously at home here that I feel like a guest.
- You don't mind if I sit down?
- Oh, please do.
Oh, how nice.
And since you're my guest, won't you...
- Won't you want a cigarette?
What I want is to know if you're really going to take it.
- Going to take it?
- Yes, my picture.
It's sticking out of your right pocket.
Well, isn't that the funniest thing?
You know, this is really all your own fault.
You have absolutely no business photographing so attractively.
- And I have a habit of collecting pictures
- of beautiful girls.
- Well, and pictures of their fathers, too?
- Pictures of their fathers...
What fathers?
My father's picture's sticking out of your left pocket.
Well, can you beat that?
How do you suppose that got there?
Just who are you, anyway?
Because you're such a good scout, I'm gonna break down and confess and tell you.
I'm Lee Taylor of The Daily World.
- Then you did it.
It was you who printed that horrible story of Father in this morning's paper.
- Horrible?
You ain't read nothing yet.
- What do you mean?
What I mean is... Well, don't you see?
Your father's a famous scientist.
He's been called in on a sensational case.
- That's news.
- But you've upset him terribly.
Now, on account of that newspaper story, he has to go some other place to carry on his investigation.
- He hates publicity.
- You mean to tell me he's leaving town?
Who's going with him?
What time are they leaving?
- What station...
- That's none of your business.
I refuse to say another word to you.
You're just contemptible and impudent enough to publish it.
Oh, impudent, maybe, but not contemptible.
- Don't call me contemptible.
- You are contemptible.
You deliberately fooled me last night into believing that you were an officer.
Well, I merely showed you my police press badge.
Don't you think you've been here a very long time?
Listen, honestly, I am ashamed.
But don't you see? This is the biggest thing that's happened in this town in six months.
If I don't get something on this story, why, I'll have to join the army of the unemployed,
- and you wouldn't want that to happen.
- I'd be very grateful to you if you'd leave.
I didn't quite get that.
Yeah, would you say it again?
A little closer.
You hard of hearing?
No, no, but don't you see? That's the closest thing to anything coaxing that you've said yet.
- You get out of here.
- Oh, don't be angry.
Come on, let's laugh it off.
- Won't you shake hands and be friends?
Lucky.
I've got to get something on this story, or I'm out of a job.
Take this home to your grandmother.
Bad luck.
There is no need to be temperamental.
We are here on a matter of the utmost gravity.
That's why I've sent for you so unceremoniously.
We are all under suspicion of murder.
- Absurd.
- What imbecile thought that up?
Gentlemen, I know you're all acquainted with these recent horrible murders.
Moon Killer murders, as the press calls them.
The investigation has proven that, in every case, the killer has made use of a surgical instrument, a type to be found only in our academy.
- But, Doctor...
- One moment, please.
Naturally, I prefer to believe that everyone in this room is innocent, but circumstances point to the conclusion that one of us may be guilty, any one of us.
Confound it, Xavier.
Bring us up here on a night like this.
Why couldn't you have told us this at the academy?
For a simple reason.
I wish to conduct an investigation of my own, alone, quietly.
And I want your help.
This is a lot of tommyrot.
Don't you realize what the publicity of a police investigation would mean to us?
You are quite right, Doctor.
What do you propose to do?
I want every one of you to submit to a psycho-neurological test, an experiment that I have devised, which I hope will prove each one of us innocent.
But if it should prove otherwise?
Then, my dear Doctor, surely one's own farewell to life is preferable to that demanded by the law.
- This is preposterous.
I refuse.
Then the police will give it to you.
Gentlemen, I consider it a privilege to have an opportunity of proving my innocence.
- Doctor, I'm ready.
- Thank you, Dr. Rowitz.
- Dr. Wells?
- Professor Duke?
- And you, Professor Haines?
- Well, if they all agree.
- Oh, I think it's a lot of nonsense.
Gentlemen, I suggest you all retire to your rooms and unpack.
In 10 minutes we shall all meet in the laboratory.
A still?
Wonder where they bottle it.
You and me both.
Very well, Doctor.
At once.
Your room is at the end of the corridor.
Mine's over there.
I just fixed yours for the night.
Is there anything else, miss?
Why, Mamie, what's the matter with you?
Your teeth are chattering.
This terrible house. It gives me the horrors worse than ever.
Well, don't be absurd.
Go to bed and go to sleep.
Well, I hope you get a good night's sleep.
- Good night, Mamie.
Come, Mamie.
How would you like to meet a ghost in here, eh, Mamie?
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
He'd be a lot pleasanter than you.
Stop that, Otto.
There ain't anything in this room to be afraid of.
So you can just stop trying to make me nervous.
Well, well, Mr. Zilch, how are you?
The smells, don't they remind you of an embalming parlor, eh, Mamie?
The only thing in this room that does that right now is you.
Yes, you can laugh now, if you want to, but you won't laugh tonight when you have to wear these for the experiment.
- Where did Dr. Xavier get that?
- From the morgue.
The old scrubwoman wore these the night that she was murdered.
Look, Mamie, look here.
You can see some of the blood on them.
- No, Otto!
No, please, Otto!
No, no!
- Look, Mamie. Look, Mamie.
- I take back what I said, please.
- Look, Mamie, look.
Otto, Mamie, what's wrong with the switchboard? What's going on here?
- Nothing, sir.
- Yes, there is, Doctor.
- He's trying to scare me.
- Otto, stop this foolishness.
- Now, pay attention, both of you.
- You have the dress, Otto?
- Right here, sir.
Mamie, you'll kindly put it on.
- Put in on?
But, Doctor...
- Now, I want your help.
You and Otto will enact the last murder of the so-called Moon Killer before an audience I've selected.
Otto knows all about it and will instruct you in your part.
- What part do I play?
- The scrubwoman, of course.
- The one who was murdered last night.
- Murdered?
But, Doctor, please, please.
Couldn't Otto play it?
No, Otto has his own part, that of the killer.
Remember our signals, Otto.
Just as I explained.
You see, Mamie, there's nothing to be afraid of.
There's nothing...
How've you been, babe?
Now, cut it out, now, will you?
Cut it out.
There's nothing like this way.
How utterly absurd.
Good heavens, Doctor, what have you done with your laboratory here?
It's nothing like it was at my last visit.
- I've made a few changes, that's all.
- A thousand, I should say.
Thermal tubes, huh?
A blood reaction, by high frequency current, as well.
- Am I correct, Professor?
- Precisely.
And tonight I hope to prove my theory.
Now, gentlemen, would you kindly be seated in these chairs?
We'll begin the experiment.
Well, if we must, then let us get it over with quickly.
Dr. Rowitz, Dr. Haines and Professor Duke.
And now, gentlemen, with your permission, Dr. Wells will assist you in clamping these contact wires to your wrists.
Are yours included?
Certainly.
As close as possible.
But, see that the connections aren't too tight.
You'll be quite comfortable.
Pardon me a moment, Doctor, as I attach the contact clamp.
Did I have to come all the way down from the city to play guinea pig for you?
I'm sure you'll forgive me in just a few moments.
- We're ready, Professor.
- The moon.
- Just as though we'd ordered it.
- Close those curtains.
Give me the shivers.
Moon shining right in my face.
No, leave them alone.
- Close them!
- Shall I?
- All right, you may close them, Wells.
Now, listen, please, to what I have to say.
One of us in this room may be a murderer.
A murderer who killed by the light of a full moon, leaving his victim's body mutilated.
A cannibal.
Evidence shows the killer has two hands.
Therefore, only Wells is eliminated.
So I shall ask him to work the apparatus.
Wells?
How about me?
A hopeless paralytic.
Silence, please, Professor.
Wells, will you take your place outside in the recording cabinet?
Yes, Doctor.
I'm going to leave you for a moment now, while I check the variability of your blood reactions.
I suggest that you remain silent during my absence.
Wells, the young quack.
Had him for an intern before he could grow a beard.
If you ask me, I think Dr. Xavier is using very unethical methods.
Necessity has no ethics, sir.
Gentlemen, I am now turning on the 100-milliampere, high-frequency coil.
Your pulses are connected with the magnetic rotators, and each variation of your heartbeat reaction is amplified 4,000 times.
We can proceed now.
One moment, Doctor.
Were the murdered women attacked?
Does your mind never run into any other channel?
What do you mean by that statement?
I mean that your sadistic tendencies may someday carry you too far, Dr. Haines.
- You, you...
- Silence, gentlemen, please.
Now, it is my theory that one of us in the past, through dire necessity, was driven to cannibalism.
The memory of that act was hammered like a nail into the mind of that man.
Shrewd and brilliant, he could conceal his madness from the human eye.
Even from himself.
But he can't conceal it from the eyes of the radio sensitivity.
Every time his heart beats from mental excitement, the thermal tubes will betray him.
You are all now connected with these tubes.
I am myself.
But I alone know which tube is yours.
Your heart beats are being reflected before you.
Doctor, I protest!
He whose tube does that is the guilty man.
Here are a line of wax figures, lifelike reproductions of the pitiful victims, people whose lives were snuffed out and whose bodies were torn to satisfy the desires.
First, a woman of the streets, killed in the tenement district.
Her body found late at night in a gutter.
The next victim, a middle-aged woman, killed just before dawn as she was on her way to market.
Her bleeding body found under a dock by the waterfront.
Then, a dope fiend, strangled and mutilated in the doorway of a dance hall.
Next, a beautiful young girl, violently killed as she lay on a hospital bed recovering from an illness.
Oh, I'm so afraid.
I'm shaking like a leaf.
Keep quiet.
Get ready.
You're about to see reenacted the murder of the killer's latest victim.
An old scrubwoman.
She's coming home from work.
A full moon shines down upon her.
She's passing through an alleyway when suddenly a terrible figure steals out, starts creeping towards her.
As old Annie stoops to pick up a newspaper, the figure suddenly takes her throat in his powerful hands.
Get your hands off me, Otto.
You're hurting my throat.
- Turn on the lights!
- Someone's coming in the room!
Stop it, stop it, I can't stand any more!
Xavier, turn on the lights!
I can't get my breath.
- The lights!
- Look at that tube.
It's a success.
The guilty man is...
The guilty man is Rowitz.
Rowitz.
Look, what's happened to him?
- He's been murdered.
- Let me see.
What has happened?
Stabbed in the base of the brain.
Murdered like all the other Moon Killer victims.
- Who was sitting on his left side?
- I was, but I didn't see anything.
I was watching the experiment.
Duke, you're walking!
I walked.
You saw me.
You saw me, I walked.
- You walked? You faker, you killed him.
- Quiet, Haines.
Don't you recognize hysteria reaction when you see it?
- Otto, help him.
- Take it easy, Doctor.
You'll need all your strength for your work tonight.
Where's Wells?
The contacts are broken.
Why doesn't he come in?
Take him to another room.
Wells!
What's wrong, man?
The lights went out.
Someone called my name.
I started for the laboratory, and someone struck me.
Oh, this is terrible!
Easy, now.
Let me help you.
I will be all right in just a moment.
Watch your head.
Are you sure you heard no one approaching the room when we started the test?
Nothing unusual happened until I was struck.
Father, something terrible has happened to Dr. Rowitz.
- I just saw him...
- Now, Joanne, dear, be calm.
Dr. Rowitz has met with an accident.
- I wish you'd go back to your room.
- He's dead?
You can't do anything here, Joanne.
It's best that you go back to your room.
- Your father will explain everything later.
- Now, come, Joanne.
Doctor. Doctor.
- What is it, Haines?
- There's someone hiding in this closet.
Another one?
He's the young man who was at the house today.
He fainted.
- Some water, Otto, quickly.
I took the liberty of having something on hand
- for just such an occasion, sir.
Here, young man, drink this.
How's that, huh?
It's not bad.
How much do you pay for it?
He's all right now.
What were you doing in that closet?
- Hiding.
Lee Taylor, The Daily World.
You wouldn't give me a break, so I had to take it.
- Don't be absurd.
He is a newspaper man.
He's the one who printed the story about you in yesterday's World.
You see, I had to get the story.
I was hiding in there, and everything was going great, when all of a sudden, well, I guess I just fainted.
It's gonna be kind of tough if I have to lug smelling salts around with me the rest of my life.
Yes, well, newspaper man or not, you're an impostor.
I don't like your methods.
I shall hand you over to the police.
- Otto...
- That suits me.
I'll phone my story in from the police station.
- You'll phone no story.
- Father, let me talk to him, will you?
I can't let this story get out now.
It'd ruin everything.
But, Father, please let me talk to him.
Mr. Taylor.
Just in case.
- You're not gonna let him go?
- Certainly not.
Otto, watch him.
Don't let him get near a phone or leave this house.
Oh, no, no.
I'm absolutely all right.
Now don't...
Don't you worry about me.
I gotta dash off to my newspaper.
- See, they won't wait.
- Mr. Taylor.
You don't have to report to the paper what you've just seen, do you?
I'm sorry, but I've got to.
You see, this is the most sensational case that's broken in six months...
But can't you wait?
Won't you give Father a chance to find out who's doing it?
What difference does it make to the public what happens or how he does it so long as he catches him?
It makes a lot of difference.
The public want to read about it.
The more sensational it is, the more the son-of-a-guns love it.
Is that all you think about?
Sensationalism?
Don't you ever think about people's feelings?
Can't you realize what a scandal would do to my father's institution?
Certainly I can, but don't you realize that I'm in a hard-boiled racket?
Then, why don't you help us instead of making it so much more difficult for us?
Aren't we going through enough trouble?
Look at the trouble I've been through to get this story.
I lay down at the morgue with a bunch of stiffs.
I looked at a lot of goofy guys. I let a dumb policeman...
Will you at least stay the rest of the night and talk it over with Father in the morning?
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll hold off on this story, and I'll stay, if you let me have breakfast with the family in the morning.
I think it can be arranged.
Father usually has breakfast at 7:30.
- Oh, I am lazy.
I have mine at 9:00.
Oh, you have no idea how lazy I am.
- Could I have mine at 9:00?
- Possibly.
And will you take me for a swim afterwards?
- A swim?
- At the beach.
If you're so helpless you can't find the water, you've no business in it.
But I like the water and...
I am sorry, miss, I had no intention of disturbing you.
That's okay, Otto.
- There's old man bad luck again.
- I am sorry.
That's all right, Otto.
I'm glad you're here.
Mr. Taylor's staying for the night.
I'd like you to prepare a room for him.
I have already done so, miss.
May I suggest that you do not disturb your father any further tonight?
- He is very tired.
- That's a good idea, Otto.
Are you going swimming with me in the morning?
What will you do if I start to sink and yell for help?
Throw you an anvil.
This way, sir.
- Do you sleep very soundly, sir?
- Like a rock.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
Because this is a very strange house.
- You're telling me.
- This way, if you please.
Joanne.
Well, dear, I just wanted to be sure that the incision was made by a brain scalpel.
- Professor Haines.
- Haines, why are you here?
So I came down here to make a more thorough examination of the body.
Professor, I...
Father, will you please come to bed?
All right, darling, now, you run along, and I'll be right up.
- Good night, dear.
Professor, since we retired, this body has been...
- It has been...
- I know, but I don't want her to know.
What are you laughing about?
Oh, I know.
This.
"Hate, friendship, love." I don't blame you.
It's so banal.
Like those postcards you buy. You know?
- About "I wish you were here," and "Two little doves billing and cooing."
Oh, no, really.
I was just thinking of something.
Of what?
- Come on, let's go in the water, shall we?
- Oh, no, no, no. Oh!
Water and I are not very good friends.
No, listen, when was a little kid, I was very, very delicate, see?
- But very good looking.
Yeah, well, I won a first prize in a beauty parade.
- A baby parade at Asbury Park. - How sweet.
But my mother was constantly dunking me in a tub of water, and I would get soap in my hair and in my eyes and my thing.
And water and I are not very good friends.
So, let's stay right here, huh?
- There's somebody watching us.
Oh, this is a terrible place.
I wish I were away from it.
If you only knew the things that have happened.
Listen. Forget that I'm a newspaperman.
I wouldn't betray your confidence.
Don't you see the only thing I'm concerned about is your safety?
Are you worried about your father?
Yes, I am, terribly.
I wouldn't be.
He's very tired.
He's working under a terrific strain.
- He's bound to show it.
But last night, after everyone went to bed, I saw my father bending over Rowitz's body.
I saw...
Oh, it's a terrible thought.
Oh, snap out of it.
Let's get dressed, and we'll...
Oh, we'll have breakfast.
Well, I'll let you know, your eyes...
Your eyes are so blue, when I look into them...
That's right, Mamie.
You drink it, and you'll go right to sleep.
Nothing's going to hurt you.
She'll be all right as soon as this sedative has taken effect.
But the Doctor will be mad if I can't go through with it.
No, Father knows you're sick.
Of course he won't be angry with you.
Don't you worry about the experiment.
I'm sure the Doctor will make other arrangements.
Something tells me if I go in that room tonight, tomorrow I'll be in my coffin.
Now, now.
You just be quiet and forget about everything.
Oh, Miss Joan, something horrible is gonna happen.
I feel it in my bones.
Last night I dreamed I was walking up to a casket, and when I looked inside, it was me.
Here, now, now, now. You'll be getting hysterical again.
You'll be all right.
Just go to sleep.
In the morning you'll feel fine.
I think we'd better leave her alone, Joanne.
No, Miss Joan, please don't go.
I've got too much to live for.
- How's Mamie?
- She'll be all right. Don't worry.
- Thank you, Dr. Wells.
- It's quite all right.
What's become of that newspaper fellow?
Not since dinner.
He went directly to his room.
I've been looking for him everywhere.
I have a feeling that he's sneaked out and phoned the story of Rowitz's murder to the papers.
Publicity of that sort would ruin everything.
I don't think he'd do that.
He gave you his word.
I asked you not to let him out of your sight, dear.
- Why don't we look in his room?
- Oh, will no one obey me anymore?
Skull, crossbones.
- Did you find him, dear?
- No, not yet, Dad.
- He's right here, sir.
- The Commissioner of Police, sir.
- Hello, Commissioner.
- Look here, Doctor, I've decided to send an undercover man up there tonight when you start your tests.
No, there won't be any tests tonight.
You'll have to give me another 24 hours.
Well, the woman I was depending upon was taken sick this afternoon, and it spoils all my plans.
Well, I'm sorry, but if things have gotten beyond your control, I'm coming down there right away to take charge.
I'm in a tough spot.
I've got murder enough already to explain to the press and public.
- And if you think for a moment...
- One moment, Commissioner.
The 48 hours aren't up yet.
Well, I have to make some other arrangements.
Hold your men up just a little longer.
Give me one more chance, please.
All right!
I'll give you until midnight.
If you haven't got your man then, I'm coming down there and slap the whole place under arrest.
Yank you all up to headquarters whether you like it or not.
Father, I want to help you.
You can't count on Mamie.
- Let me take her place.
No, I couldn't ask you to do that, Joan.
But please, Dad.
You get a squad car down to Blackstone Shoals at midnight, sharp.
Put the signal button on the control table and attach the wires to the thermal tubes.
What's the meaning of all this paraphernalia? Idiotic nonsense.
These chairs are too far apart to protect us from each other.
The contacts have all been checked.
You'll be ready in just a moment.
- Thank you, Wells.
- Doctor, I still think you're making a mistake using Joanne in this experiment.
After all, gentlemen, this is my daughter's own suggestion.
I have no fear for her safety.
She's a sensible girl and knows what she's doing.
Yeah, and if she were my daughter, she wouldn't be up there on a bed in nothing but a nightgown just to satisfy some lunatic's experiment.
Professor Duke, don't criticize Joanne for her state of undress.
This argument is irrelevant.
Doctor, you forget that last night there was a murderer at large in this room.
And the murderer is still here.
I'm convinced.
But I've taken precaution against that.
You will each of you be handcuffed to your chairs, and you'll notice that each chair is bolted to the floor.
I refuse to submit!
You'll have us in straightjackets next!
I won't sit here handcuffed while you're running around loose.
I intend to be handcuffed also.
That will assure us there can't possibly be a repetition of last night's tragedy.
Oh, Wells.
They're very becoming to you, Haines.
It is time to get ready.
Aren't you afraid, miss?
There's only one thing I'm afraid of, Otto.
That's Father's health.
He's been working so hard, and lately he seems so strange.
The human mind will only stand so much.
We are all a little strange up here.
That's why I want Father to get away from here.
He needs a long rest.
He's promised me that just as soon as this is over, he'll go abroad with me.
You are right, miss.
Don't be afraid tonight.
Be sure you keep your eyes closed.
And relax.
Is that all, Doctor?
Yes, everything's set.
Now, go to the electric cabinet and do exactly as I told you.
Throw on the current the moment you are ready.
Yes, sir.
Doctor, has it ever occurred to you that Wells is free to do as he pleases?
I've guarded against that also.
Wells wishes to be treated the same as we are.
- Otto.
- Yes, sir?
Bolt all the doors so that no one can get in.
- The rest you know. - Yes, sir.
Here are the keys.
Synthetic flesh.
And now you are about to witness one of the most gruesome crimes of the Moon Killer.
The death of Florence Johnson.
Murdered and horribly mutilated as she was lying weak and helpless on a hospital bed.
It's midnight, a private room at the Arch Hospital.
The nurse leaves the room for a moment.
The girl is alone when suddenly...
When suddenly the Moon Killer appears.
He crosses softly to his victim.
It's the killer!
- The killer!
Fight him off, Joan!
- Joanne!
- Wells, Wells.
Otto!
You idiots are calling for Wells?
It'll do you no good!
There isn't any Wells!
Look, the keys.
Well, take them.
It's Wells.
- Wells!
- Yes, it is Wells.
But a new Wells.
A Wells whose name will live forever in the history of science.
Go! Run, Joanne!
Run, run!
Joanne, get up, run!
The keys.
Look at his hand. Horrible!
Yes, look at it, a real hand.
It's alive.
It's flesh.
For years I've been searching to find the secret of a living manufactured flesh.
And now I found it.
You I think I went to Africa to study cannibalism?
I went there to get samples of the human flesh that the natives eat.
Yes, that's what I needed.
Living flesh from humans for my experiments.
What difference did it make if a few people had to die?
Their flesh taught me how to manufacture arms, legs, faces that are human!
I'll make a crippled world whole again.
Doctor, your name will be remembered.
You've given your life, everything to science.
All but one thing, and now you're gonna give even that to science.
Your daughter.
Oh, if only I were not powerless here in chains.
Run!
Fight him off, Joanne!
Fight him off.
Save her!
Joanne!
Run! Run!
Club him!
- Where'd he go?
Oh, Father!
- Oh, Father.
- Are you hurt?
- Lee!
- Wells.
What happened to him?
Calm down.
He won't ever come back.
I hit him with a lamp. It was a long throw, but...
You know, I used to be a first baseman in high school.
You know, that old peg over to third.
Take a look at him.
- Are you hurt, Lee?
- I'm all right.
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm so glad.
Because you...
I want to...
I better keep my mind on my work.
You say you can't understand me?
I'm talking too fast?
You'd be talking fast, too, if you'd been through what I've been through.
Boy, am I out.
Now listen, listen, Willard,
I want you to give Dr. X full credit for trapping him.
Dr. X. Now I'll call you back in five minutes with more details.
More to follow, more to...
Oh, Mr. Taylor.
I can't tell you how grateful I am for all that you've done for us.
Oh, you've got my heart going a mile a minute.
Your heart?
Oh, I'm so glad.
Take this to the society editor.
It is rumored that, on her return from Europe,
Miss Xavier will have a very important announcement to make concerning a very promising and prominent young newspaperman.
More later.
Say, tell me how in the world did you ever overpower that terrible monster?
Oh, I...
In the third round, I found out that he was very ticklish in a certain spot.
But I haven't found your weakness.
- Don't you know?
- You don't mean...
Come here to me.
Marius, bring some rum. Fanny has fainted.
Where is the boy?
Send Marius up here!
My poor child!
Open the bedroom door.
Honoré, get rid of all these people!
You too. Have word with these idiots.
It's nothing, Norine.
Don't upset yourself.
Look, she's better already.
What happened?
She fainted when The Malaisie left.
The sailing ship that's left for a five-year trip.
She fainted because the ship left?
Yes, because Marius is on board.
He's on the ship?
César's son?
Yes, and Fanny knows.
What about César?
He suspects nothing.
There's going to be trouble.
I pity the first person he meets after he hears.
It's a disaster.
He'll take it very hard.
Full speed astern.
Come, Fortunette.
She's better now.
She's conscious and she's speaking.
Seen Marius?
Not since this morning.
He must have bumped into a friend.
I won't tell him off, not today.
I can say now it's almost official.
The children are marrying.
Really?
That's good news.
Only...
Only what?
It's no great surprise. Everyone expected it.
But it has given me more joy that you can imagine, Honoré.
It has given me renewed life.
It's almost as if I were the fiancé.
And maybe in a year's time...
Grand, eh?
Everyone to his taste.
Some people can do without all that.
There's no need to be so sour.
You're vexed because you proposed to Fanny yourself.
No, it's not that at all.
Don't try to hide. It makes you sad.
Brace up. You old girl!
You have to take these things phisolophically.
What do you expect?
Young people are made for each other.
It's only natural. You have to resign yourself.
Exactly.
That's a fine thing you just said.
Resign yourself to events.
Accept the inevitable.
Friends, or just one good friend... we know will do their best to be a comfort and help in time of trouble.
It's really upset you.
No, I'm all right.
But if one day some terrible blow strikes you down... you can count on your old friend, Panisse.
That's most kind of you, but today is a day for celebrating.
- Monsieur.
- Madame.
While your son isn't here, after what has happened this morning, I insist you ask for Fanny's hand.
While I'm averse too for the same reasons, only in reverse, you shall have her hand. However, I regret it heartily.
What did you do to make her faint?
I didn't do anything!
Put yourself in Fanny's shoes.
A widow's daughter.
I know you didn't kill your husband but there's no man in your family.
- Don't interrupt.
A widow's daughter, almost destitute.
Suddenly, she finds she's to marry a wonderful man — my son.
Heir to a wonderful bar — my bar.
She's overjoyed.
No wonder she faints.
Of course.
Becoming part of your family is such an honour.
But for you, we'd want for food.
I didn't mean...
That's what you said.
The prettiest girl in Marseilles faints because she's to marry a barman.
Your future father-in-law has insulted me.
Don't fight, mother. It's not worth it.
- He has gone.
- Who has?
He has gone, César.
He has left us.
Where has he gone?
He left on The Malaisie this morning.
Gone for five years.
What are you saying?
He's been dying to go for a long time.
Boats were his passion.
He was mad about them.
He found a job on The Malaisie.
He deserted you after what he'd done to you?
Was that any way to behave?
He would have stayed if I'd wanted it.
But I couldn't see him suffer.
He was consumed by his love for the sea.
So I told him I didn't want him any longer. I didn't love him any more.
César, my old pal César.
You're lucky: you've no children.
Wait while I measure.
This is crazy.
It isn't crazy. It's a game of bowls.
I'm nearest.
Right, my turn.
Hurry up!
Quiet!
You'll put him off his stroke.
You lucky devil!
Bravo, captain.
At twenty-five metres too.
Captain, congratulations.
Congratulations?
The man is a cheat. He stepped forward four paces.
- Four steps, me?
- You took four steps.
No, five.
I can assure you...
I assure you I'm leaving.
First I'm robbed and soon I'll be poisoned.
I wouldn't give your wife's fish soup to my dog, even if I had one.
The fish in it hadn't swum since the Olympic Games.
As for the water she puts in the pan, it was full of tadpoles.
Which of you is going to deny it?
Don't say anything.
Give me my umbrella!
Whatever made you invite that rude man?
Since Marius left a month ago, he's been impossible.
If you ask me, he's going mad.
Yes, he's going from bad to worse.
I knew a man like him.
His brain softened and melted inside.
When he shook his head, you could hear it... splashing about.
A very strange case.
Most odd.
- You don't believe me?
- Of course. I knew an odder case.
But instead the brain dried up.
It shrivelled like a chick pea.
As he walked along, his brain rang like a bicycle bell.
Especially on cobbles.
Stop it.
You made that up.
Just as you did.
Go on, say it in front of everyone you think I'm a liar.
Of course I do.
I regret to inform you that you're absolutely right.
Cheers!
What's he doing?
Waiting for the postman.
It's the same every day.
He's a good son, writing every day.
He hasn't written at all, not even once.
Not even Fanny.
She waits too.
If you ask me, it will kill them both.
Packing up already?
No, I'm handing over to Miette.
I have to sell on Fanny's seashell stall.
Is your girl poorly?
She's not at all well.
I'm sure Marius hasn't written.
And he won't admit it.
He bottles it all up so it swells inside him and chokes him.
Sadness is like a tapeworm. You have to evacuate it.
You're right.
If we could make him talk to us, I'm sure it would relieve his mind.
Open the valve and reduce the pressure.
Precisely.
Somehow we have to make him tell us.
That won't be easy.
But we can try.
After all, he can't eat us.
We can't leave it.
You're right. He's bound to bawl us out but that can't be helped.
It would be cowardly of us to hold back.
We must act.
And we shall.
You do it.
Me?
Why not?
All right, but you must back me up.
Of course. I'm the submarine fleet.
I keep my distance. While he's answering your broadside, I dive and torpedo him.
So let's go.
Expecting someone?
Who would I be expecting?
I don't know.
Monsieur Panisse, why are you spying on me?
Who pays you and why?
I'm not spying on you.
Then why ask if I'm expecting someone?
I couldn't care less whether you're expecting someone or not.
- I'm glad to hear it.
- Exactly.
- What about your torpedo?
- Wait. Say, César...
Could it be you're waiting for the post?
Why would I be?
I don't know. Maybe a letter from your son.
Stop it.
Don't interfere in my personal affairs.
I don't ask you if your wife is having an affair with the Weights and Measures Officer.
You're not asking but you're telling me.
Can it be true?
Your torpedo exploded under your feet.
Don't worry. It's not true, Félix.
True or false, leave me alone.
Learn some discretion from me.
Don't ask me about Marius.
And the same applies to you.
- I asked nothing.
You don't ask anything but you have a way of talking that sounds as if you want to know.
You force me to speak out.
We wouldn't dream...
I don't want to know anything.
After thirty years of friendship, you don't care what happens to me.
That's what you meant. You couldn't care less.
I was humouring you. Do as you like.
Don't speak if you'd rather not.
I knew you'd end up by asking me.
All right, if you insist.
Nobody is forcing you.
Yes, you are.
Monsieur Brun, shut up.
Since I must speak, don't interrupt me.
Go ahead, César.
I can see it in your eyes and everybody else's that you pity me.
I know what you're saying behind my back.
He's all alone in that big house.
He neglects the bar. He's had no news from his son and it's breaking his heart.
Since that's the way you think... Since you attach such importance to something so trivial, let me explain once and for all.
Yes, that's it.
Félix asked if I expected the postman.
The answer to that question is no.
He couldn't send a letter before reaching Port Said.
The Malaisie reached Port Said twelve days ago.
Letters take two weeks...
Mail boats take only nine days. But they don't sail every day.
- You really think so?
But why waste time talking about it?
It's not important.
Don't pretend you're not interested.
Let's suppose it entered the boy's head to write a letter to his father.
A few words each day to say he's all right and thinking of you.
That he knows how sad you must be.
And suppose he set it aside every night and, when he reached Port Said, he put the whole stack in the post.
Suppose the postman entered this bar and said, "César, this is for you".
And he gave me this three kilo package. Enough reading matter to last the night through.
I tell you I'd take the package, put it under the counter and I wouldn't open it. Because it doesn't interest me.
Come on, you love your son.
Yes, I loved the boy.
But not after what he did.
What did he do?
My God, what did he do?
Exactly.
What has he done to you?
He has left me. That's what he's done.
At twenty, surely he had the right?
Not without warning.
- That's true.
- But what could you have done?
Stopped him.
With a kick up the backside?
Exactly. I'd have soon made him forget the sea.
Good thing he said nothing.
So you approve of his rebellion, do you?
Hear that?
A Bolshevik wants to wreck the family.
You expect me to listen to this in my own bar?
But, César, if a man wants to go to sea...
A man?
Marius is a man?
Marius is a man?
He's twenty-three. At his age, you were married.
You were a man.
What's true for you is true for him.
I see it differently.
I'm not my son.
With all due respect, I must say I think you're very selfish.
He has told you straight.
Indeed.
You've no right to stop him.
He can sail anywhere he likes, just so long as it isn't on water.
What good is that?
There's no need to go to sea.
He could sail like you in the port or on some river or pond.
Sailing isn't the only way to make a living!
Does Monsieur Panisse sail?
No, he has more sense.
He makes sails.
He makes sails so that the wind will take other men's sons away.
Have you anything for me?
No, there's nothing.
I don't write the letters, I only deliver them.
A letter from Port Said.
It's very thick.
It's from Marius. It says on the back.
Read it, César.
Open the letter.
Leave it there.
Read it.
Go on. For Fanny's sake.
You may be interested in that unnatural fellow but I'm not.
He'll never read that letter while we're here.
Let's take our leave discreetly.
Good idea.
Is it agreed?
Yes, it's agreed.
You agree but you're not budging. You want to see everything.
After all the gibes I've endured about the Lyonnais, I'm entitled to say this.
We Lyonnais know the meaning of decency.
What does he mean?
He's right.
Come on, let's go.
Curiosity killed the cat!
You don't look well.
You should see a doctor.
What's the point?
He'll tell you what's wrong.
He'd see if you were anaemic, maybe give you a tonic.
My mother would fear the worst.
Then don't tell her you're going. Try Dr Venelle.
He's my doctor, a nice fatherly man.
Go one afternoon.
I'd be happy to pay.
That's most kind but I can pay.
Cheer up.
I'm sure there are lots of messages for you in that letter.
I doubt it.
But you hope there are.
What a silly thing love is.
More miserable than silly.
Don't worry. He's in his kitchen learning that letter by heart.
We'll all know about it by tonight.
Fanny, come here, my love!
Ah, here he is.
He's all right. Re-read it to me.
Go ahead.
"Dear Dad, "Forgive me for upsetting you.
"I know how sad you must be. I think of you every night."
And I think of you all day too, you idiot!
"It's difficult to write why I left
"but Fanny can explain.
She knows about my madness."
Madness — exactly.
I'm glad he realizes at last.
"I'll describe my life. "At first, I helped in the galley."
They must have had some fine meals!
One month and they'd end up skeletons.
"But a sailor fell into the hold and hurt himself,
"so I took his place on deck."
The next bit is awful.
"I couldn't send this earlier because we had problems.
"One of the crew fell sick and died.
"The Port Authorities thought it was the plague and put us in quarantine."
The plague, my God, on his ship!
When a school chum of his had mumps, I kept Marius at home for a month.
And now he has the plague up to here!
He's not caught it.
No, but he nearly did and it's an awful disease.
Your neck swells and your mouth falls open.
Your tongue is as thick as a bull's.
Your navel blows up and turns black.
Marius, when are you going to stop giving us so much heartache?
Carry on reading.
"The port doctors examined the corpse and said it wasn't the plague."
I should hope so!
"So now we're free to leave for Aden.
"I'm enjoying the voyage very much.
"But, sadly, we've not stopped on our way here,
"though we've passed the islands where Athens lies.
"Athens used to be a Roman fortress."
You can tell he's with educated people.
"Everything is fine and I like the life.
"I am now working with oceanographic devices."
I couldn't read that bit.
"We're going to measure the depth of the Indian Ocean."
Just fancy, Fanny.
That boy couldn't measure a drink but now he's measuring seas.
Not just the sea but an ocean.
The Indian Ocean at that!
"The scientists are very kind to me."
Of course they are.
Now there's a bit for you.
"I am well and I hope this finds you and Fanny well too."
You see, he's thinking about you.
"Let me know how she's keeping..."
"How she's keeping, " see?
"... and about her wedding to Panisse.
"I'm sure she'll be very happy.
"Wish her well from me."
"From me". Do you see?
"Write to me,
"care of The Malaisie in Aden.
"We reach there on the fifteenth.
"With all my love.
Your son, Marius."
"Your son, Marius."
At the bottom, he has written...
"Don't worry about me, I'm very happy."
He leaves us high and dry but he's over the moon.
That's the way he is.
But there you are.
I don't suppose he has much time to write, and the boat is going up and down all the time.
I could have wished there were a few more loving words for me.
And especially for you, Fanny.
But then, maybe just as he was about to write you something special, he was called away to measure the ocean.
That's the only explanation for it.
Anyway, there'll be lots of other letters.
Come on, Fanny, we must write a reply.
My hands are too clumsy to hold a pen. You must do it.
Let's go into the kitchen. Come along.
Keep an eye on the seashell stall and shut the bar.
We're closed for correspondence.
Ready?
"My dear son,
"I have received your letter at last.
"It's not very long.
"I hope your next will run to at least ten pages.
"Or even twenty.
"What you say about the scientists
"is most interesting.
"But, when you're measuring the depths of the seas,
"mind you don't lean out too far or you'll go overboard.
"And, if the sea is very deep,
"leave the job to another man."
I know what Marius is like.
We went fishing in Panisse's boat once.
He leaned out to see his line and fell in.
His head was heavier than his bottom then, but that's all changed now.
Where were we? Read the last bit.
"Leave it to another".
Underline "another".
More than once, very hard.
"And if someone has the plague,
"don't go near him.
"Keep well away, even if he's your best friend.
"Friendship is all very well,
"but the plague is the end of the world.
"Everything is fine here.
"Except for the anger which seized me when you left
"and still hasn't left me.
"Poor Fanny "isn't at all well.
"She hardly eats a thing.
"She's very pale.
"Everyone round here has noticed.
"All day they keep repeating...
"Fanny is fading away and César is going mad.
"Furthermore, Honorine throws me baleful glances.
"Whenever I see her, I'm scared she'll draw a gun.
"It sends shivers down my spine."
Why aren't you writing?
If you put all that, you'll upset him.
But he upset us, didn't he?
There's no point in paying him back.
I suppose you're right.
What shall we say then?
I'll write it for you.
Not yet.
Tell me out loud first.
Well, we'll say...
"Fanny is much as usual.
"Nothing is fixed about her wedding,
"as far as I know."
That's excellent.
"Fanny hasn't changed.
"From time to time, we talk about you on the terrace outside the bar.
"Sometimes, at night, when it's quiet
"and Escartefigue, Panisse and Brun are talking,
"it's as if you weren't all that far away.
"It's as if you'd just gone to the station to fetch Fanny's baskets.
"You'll be back in a moment, wearing your panama hat
"and your neckerchief."
Why, you little...!
It's Escartefigue's driver! That orange was rotten.
You might at least have used a fresh one.
I didn't recognize you.
Come here at once or I'll call the police!
Bend over so I can kick you.
I took you for an American.
For an American?
I only saw you from behind.
He took me for an American.
I forgive him.
But next time you see an American, make sure it isn't me.
Claudine, you go.
It's a man in a top hat.
It isn't the bailiff, is it?
I'm not in debt!
Please come in, sir.
If it isn't Master Panisse.
Yes, it's me. Hello, ladies!
How are you?
Fine. How about you?
Never better, as you see.
Yes, you look marvellous.
So do you.
You quite scared me.
I've just been to the wedding of an old friend, Ulysse Pijeautard.
And the gloves.
Very elegant.
Do sit down.
As I was all dressed up, it seemed a suitable moment to renew a request, the outcome of which will influence my entire future.
I wish to marry your daughter.
You know that already.
Will you give her to me?
Of course we will.
Keep out of this, you idiot!
You heard what happened?
- Marius and Fanny...
- I know.
He says he knows.
- Not everything. - I know all I need to know.
Not at all.
I'd rather not talk about Marius.
The weather, taxes, anything else, but not Marius.
It's only fair to tell you I found them in bed together.
Did you have to say it?
Promise me one thing. What's that?
Not to kill her if she deceives you.
I'm a kind man, as you know, but I can't renounce that right.
That I can't promise.
Murderer!
It's impossible.
It's my upbringing.
I'm not English.
I've oriental blood. We don't have cuckolds in my family.
You didn't kill your first wife. My wife never deceived me.
Furthermore, she did my accounts.
I'd do anything for Fanny but if she deceives me, she dies.
You savage!
Then it's no and no.
Wait a moment.
I'd never try to find out.
I'd never stoop to spying on her.
Even if I had proof or saw her in her lover's arms, my faith in her is such I'd not believe it.
That is my position.
That's different then.
I'll give you an answer tomorrow evening.
- May I hope a little?
- A lot, Panisse.
Forgive me.
I loved him too much.
Make him come back.
Bring him back so he can give my baby a name.
Holy Virgin, free me from evil thoughts.
Give me the strength to live.
Give me the courage to confess to my mother.
It will cause her so much pain.
So there you are!
Do you want every day off now?
Been out for a walk?
Claudine doesn't want to see you sulking.
She's not sulking.
Look at the face she's pulling.
Don't scold her.
It's passion, can't you see?
Let's eat.
I'm dying of hunger.
Fanny, help me lay the table. You must be hungry too.
I'm going to have a baby.
What's that you say?
Good grief! A baby?
Get out! You're a disgrace!
If your father were here, he'd kill you.
Leave this house!
Go out on the streets like the others!
Pack up and go!
Stop it!
You're worse than Zoé. You've shamed the family!
Get out before I take this broom to you!
Oh, my God, fetch the vinegar.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Fanny, darling.
She's deathly pale.
Fanny, my darling, don't die.
I forgive you, my dear.
Don't worry. I'm better now.
Take a sniff of this.
There, the colour is coming back into her cheeks.
Yes, you should blush for very shame.
Norine, stop it!
You cry when she faints and then you start all over again.
Of course it's a tragedy but you might have guessed.
When a girl has a lover, it's to be expected.
Let me talk to her.
Fanny, dear, you're quite sure?
And is Marius the father?
Of course he is.
She hasn't slept with the whole of Marseilles.
So it's Marius!
I could kill him!
He's not behaved very well and he had no right to do it, but what's done can't be undone.
Tell me, darling, when did you find out?
I've felt unwell ever since he left.
I wasn't myself.
I felt sick in the mornings.
I was scared.
I thought of nothing else, night and day.
I cried so much, I was in a stupor.
And Marius never wrote.
- I wanted to drown myself.
- Don't say that!
So this morning I went to see Dr Venelle.
He's a good man.
What did he say?
It will be in March.
Just the month.
The month of the March hare.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
It's sad losing one's honour but once it's gone, it's gone.
What are you going to do now?
Anything you say, so long as I can stay.
Then it's all right.
There's no problem.
Marry Panisse.
You think he'd have me?
He asked again this morning.
And this time it's yes.
What do you think?
I earn a good living.
I can manage on my own.
I'd rather not marry. I'd prefer to look after the baby alone till his father returns.
If he ever does.
That sounds fine but it's hard...
It's not hard, it's impossible.
Listen, Fanny. In every family, there's a black sheep. Nobody minds, it's natural.
But Aunt Zoé has taken that place already.
We'll be disgraced if you don't marry Panisse.
Does he still want me?
He asked again.
But I'm pregnant. Fortunately he doesn't know that.
You'd lie to him?
It would be stupid to tell him.
Not to tell would be criminal.
After all, you can't be sure.
Dr Venelle said I was.
What does he know?
He's in his dotage.
Then I don't need to marry.
You don't have to be pregnant to marry.
Take Panisse and say nothing.
That would be monstrous.
It's dishonest.
It's not dishonest.
One man gets you into trouble.
Now another must pay. No, it's my fault.
I must take the best I can out of it.
Just because he's kind, I can't land a bastard on him and steal his name!
I'd never be able to look people in the eyes again.
I'd feel terrible. I'd be worse than a prostitute.
How can you suggest it?
You're in no position to lecture us!
Stop it, Norine!
Don't start again. I know it's a tragedy but we still have to eat.
Come on, Fanny. Sit down.
I'm not hungry.
When you've no children, you're jealous of those that have. Yet when you have children, they drive you crazy.
Our Lady had only the one child and look at the trouble he caused her.
She had a boy.
Sit down and let's eat.
Do you think love children are less pretty than other babies?
Sometimes they're stronger and cleverer.
Then what are you worrying about?
You've seen the dinghy, Monsieur Brun?
Yes, I inspected it.
It seems a good price.
And it goes like the wind.
So I'm to make the sails?
Here we have a model.
And this is the cloth I suggest.
Just feel that.
It's light and it won't get wet at sea.
Feel the texture.
Yes, it seems very good.
Isn't it a bit stiff?
Is it sails you want, or ladies' trousers?
For sails, it's just what you need.
How are things?
Buying sails, are you, Monsieur Brun?
Yes, I need a set for my new boat.
What was that?
You've bought a boat?
The Pitalugue, on Panisse's advice.
The Pitalugue? That long, thin thing?
That boat has quite a reputation.
Come now, César!
- Didn't you warn him?
- About what?
- César means it's problematic.
- What, César is?
No, the boat.
She tends to list a bit.
Is that serious?
Climb aboard and she capsizes.
Once her keel is in the air though, she won't budge.
Does that often happen?
The boat is well-known, they call her the submarine.
- Is he kidding? - He's joking.
You're saying I shall capsize?
Who's to say?
She's done it so often now, maybe she's grown tired of it.
What makes the boat do it?
The propeller is too big for the boat.
So if you open the throttle, instead of the propeller, it's the boat that turns — turtle.
Stop it now.
Monsieur Brun knows the boat isn't new. He's paying a rock bottom price.
It's a bargain.
It's worth buying, don't you agree?
Yes, if you fancy drowning.
Panisse, you advised me to buy the boat.
Tell me honestly. Will it capsize?
Capsizing is only natural, especially where boats are concerned.
And especially that one.
I can't guarantee she won't capsize.
It's a risk you take.
If you'd rather not take that risk, buy an island, not a boat.
Buy the Château d'If.
Panisse will make you the sails.
You're in deep waters.
Not at all, my dear César.
You like to tease but I don't care.
To put an end to your cavilling, I shall try the boat at once.
Will you come with me to try out The Pitalugue?
All right. But, after what César said, it will cost you more.
- Will you accompany us? - I can't.
I'm sorry.
I bet you are.
Some of us have to work.
You murderer!
Monsieur Brun, wait!
Take this lifebelt. It won't do any harm.
I'm not worried.
I know a good boat when I see one.
I can tell that.
I've examined the boat thoroughly.
The design is such that it cannot capsize.
But I will do my best to overturn it.
There's no need. Just leave it to the boat.
Can you swim?
God be with you, Monsieur Brun.
God be with me?
We'll meet in heaven.
See what you did? You've lost me a tidy sum there!
Not if the boat stays afloat.
You know full well it won't.
Why did you have to come over?
Because I've something important to say.
What might that be?
Here's a letter from Macassar.
It's from Marius?
I'll come back and talk when I've read my letter.
Read it here.
I have to read his letters at home.
Watch out, Monsieur Brun!
That'll be 10 francs!
Careful!
Bravo!
Ah, Fanny. Hello, my dear.
May I speak to you?
By all means.
It's something very serious.
Go along in.
You've something serious to say?
The same thing as César?
No.
He knows nothing about this.
Two serious matters in one day.
What a busy day!
I can guess what it is.
Your mother told you I'd asked for your hand again. You've come with your answer and you don't know how to put it.
I understand.
Let me make it easier for you.
You're going to refuse me again.
You mustn't worry on my account.
If it's no, that's just too bad.
It can't be helped.
But I haven't come to say no.
You've come to say yes?
I would have, if it were possible.
But it isn't.
There's something you don't know.
And when you know it, you won't have me.
I owe you the truth, even if you despise me for it.
Despise you?
I'd never do that.
Besides, I already know and so do most other people.
Marius was seen twice leaving your house at dawn.
What difference does that make?
If anyone remarks that I wasn't the first, I'll reply, "I'm no virgin. What difference does it make?"
Who cares?
I don't... quite the reverse.
And I'll tell you why I don't mind.
An elderly man marrying a young girl doesn't seem quite nice.
But if the girl has had a lover, that rights the balance.
I don't lose my self-esteem or self-respect, which I prize enormously.
That's how I see it.
You're so good, Panisse.
But there's something worse than that.
Something that can't be dismissed or be undone.
Can't you understand?
Yes, I want to.
I'm trying.
You've understood but you're pretending not to because I fill you with horror.
You don't have to hide it.
You're right not to have me.
I'm disgraced!
I've not even the right to kill myself!
Is it a baby, Fanny?
Fanny, tell me. Is it a baby?
You're sure?
The doctor told you?
That's why you were looking peaky.
Don't despise me too much.
You asked my mother for me. I could have said yes.
But I had to tell you.
I'd be happy to be your wife.
You'd marry me?
I'd be so grateful.
Maybe I'd come to love you.
And you'd give me the baby?
You'd let him carry my name?
That's all I ask.
Tell me, is it true?
Do you still want me?
Fanny, did you ever look at my sign?
It says Honoré Panisse, Sail Maker.
The letters are squashed to the left to leave a space.
Come and take a look.
See these letters?
And... Son.
They've been in that drawer for thirty years.
I've never been able to put them up.
But back to the matter in hand.
Have you told anyone else your secret?
- The doctor knows.
- Of course.
Anyone else?
Mother and Claudine.
They won't talk. You're sure no one else knows?
Right. So when will this child... my child be born?
February or March.
Two months premature!
When shall we marry?
You mean it, Panisse?
Have you given it even thought?
Will you save the baby?
Since we've come to an arrangement, I shall tell you everything. I'm not making a sacrifice.
Come and sit down.
When I married Félicité, we were both very young.
We had to borrow money to buy the shop.
It didn't cost much.
The shop wasn't worth that much then.
We hired one worker, then two, then ten, then finally thirty.
Then after seven years, one evening, I said to my wife...
"Félicité, let's have a baby."
She blushed. She hid her face in her hands and said...
"I've wanted one so much but I never dared say."
But then, my poor Fanny, we failed utterly. I can't tell you the doctors we saw.
The waters, the candles, all the pilgrimages and gymnastics we did, let alone the rest.
We'd been scared to have a baby and then, when we wanted one, God refused us.
I grew mad for a child.
When I saw a man out pushing a pram, I was terribly jealous. I longed to look as ridiculous as he did.
To talk baby talk.
It was a terrible blow.
I was angry with Félicité and we began to quarrel.
I'd say things like,
"Why do you have to be fat, if you've no baby?"
And she'd retort,
"If you drank less, we'd stand a better chance."
Little by little, we grew resigned.
But we lost interest in the shop.
We just sold everyday items.
While I fooled around playing cards, others came into the business.
Renault and Peugeot and all the others started making motors.
Our poor old port is polluted now, all because Félicité was barren.
But now... everything has changed!
I'm to have a wife and a child of my very own.
You're so good, Panisse.
I'm very grateful. But give yourself a couple of days.
Might you change your mind?
If Marius writes?
I'm not counting on anyone - except you.
But I don't want you to act out of pity.
You've not understood anything I said.
Believe me, no man ever acted more selfishly than I am acting now.
I couldn't be happier!
I ask only one thing, Fanny.
Don't tell your mother or anyone else that I know.
You won't tell?
I'll say nothing.
Despite everything, I'd still like it to be a white wedding.
That way, everyone will think the baby is mine.
Come quick. I think Monsieur Brun has drowned.
His boat's keel up.
I doubt if it's true but I must go.
Wait for me in the dining-room.
It will soon be yours. Go and make yourself at home.
Let us through. What's going on?
Oh, the deuce!
Something's ticking but I can't tell if it's his heart or his watch.
He's feeling better!
If he's not drowned, he'll be after me.
You wanted to say something?
I hear you asked Norine for Fanny's hand some time ago.
They say you intend proposing again.
Though you're a neighbour and my friend, I must say this is none of your business.
It isn't?
None of your business at all.
But, as I've absolutely nothing to hide, I will tell you that I have proposed again.
I've been accepted and we decide the wedding date tonight.
It's gone that far?
It's gone even further.
I'm sorry but this wedding will not take place.
Is your son coming back?
I'm afraid not.
He won't be back for another twenty-six months.
They have to finish their measuring.
I say there'll be no marriage.
You're funny.
What right have you to forbid it?
Fanny is Marius's wife.
The town hall is a formality we can attend to when Marius returns.
What if Fanny doesn't want to wait?
She'll wait. She loves him.
So much so that she's accepted me.
She's accepted you?
That's it. Exactly.
She said yes to you?
Fanny said yes to me herself. To me personally.
I don't understand it.
Oh, yes I do — only too well!
You bought her from her mother.
You went to Honorine, promising her an annuity if she sold Fanny to you.
Own up, you old slave trader!
You can't buy a girl, especially not one like Fanny.
You must realise that.
I realise that this marriage is an outrage and a disgraceful waste.
You know very well that it is.
Just what do you mean?
It's something quite distasteful. Something dishonest.
I'm not here to act as a dictionary!
Just because two women are mad, it's no reason to take advantage of them.
Answer me this, Panisse.
Are you going to marry her?
That's right.
- I choose to.
I'm afraid tempers will rise. We may begin shouting at each other. And I'll end up strangling you.
let's keep it calm.
Take it easy.
Fine by me.
Forgive me, but when an elderly man marries a young girl, it's not very nice.
In fact, it's unpleasant. It's displeasing.
Not to me.
Now we see what you're really after.
You're marrying Fanny because she's pretty and you want to rub your leathery old hide up against her soft skin.
Not only that.
But that's partly it.
I find it disgusting.
I am disgusted! And that is your right.
But I don't want to be disgusted!
In such delicate family matters, you should behave like a gentleman. Not like a small-time crook!
If you refuse to listen to my advice, I'll meet you at the church.
- Coming out?
- No, going in.
What will you say?
The first thing you'll feel is a hammer blow on your head!
Then I'll take you like this and rough you up.
I'll mash you to pulp and throw the bits to the winds!
Very well. But, if you even so much as tap me, I shall shoot you.
With a good regulation gun!
It only needs wheels and you'd have a cannon.
For forty years, you've called yourself my friend.
A bloody nuisance more like!
All that time, you've tyrannised and belittled me.
At school, I had to play your games.
You made me carry your satchel.
When you were given lines, I had to write them while you ate my sweets!
You made my life a misery. I used to write it all down in a notebook.
I used to pray I'd become stronger than you, so I could give you a good thrashing!
But you grew faster than me.
You've a persecution complex.
Then, when I fell in love with Marie Frisette and she liked me, out of jealousy, you came between us!
She was ghastly.
As thin as a rake and cross-eyed.
No, she wasn't. She was slim and it was only a slight squint.
But lovely even so.
Not that you were jealous of her.
It was me!
Because I'd ceased to be your slave.
That's why you parted us. This tyranny went on for 30 years!
Do you think I'll let you do that again?
You can't stop my marriage! Rather than that, I'd put a bullet through your head!
You've killed the diver.
Let that serve as a lesson.
I'd kill you like I killed him.
Don't be an idiot.
You were so scared your legs were like jelly.
I've no more to say to you. I'll speak to Fanny.
This wedding shall not take place.
It's Fanny you want?
Then come this way.
César is determined to stop our wedding, even by criminal means.
- Speak to him.
- Not yet, Fanny.
He's not being fair.
You're engaged to Marius.
He's away at the moment but he'll be back.
Isn't that the way it is?
I can't wait two years.
Those women put you up to this.
Mother is right.
You can't understand.
I understand only too well she's putting you in Panisse's bed.
Your mother never used to be this fussy.
Wasn't she your father's mistress before they married?
And what difference did it make?
Did it stop them being happy?
Tell Panisse you were scared.
He'll release you from your promise and I'll talk to your mother.
No, I must have a husband.
What did you say?
You must have a husband?
You'll take any old codger who comes along, provided he's rich?
César, I'd wait another ten years if I could.
But I can't wait any longer.
Not any more.
If Panisse wants me, I'll marry him.
It's not possible.
Now I see your little scheme.
You sent Marius away.
You said so yourself!
You sent him off so you'd be rid of him.
You wanted Panisse's money and this old fool is content. Stop it.
You're talking nonsense.
You're just like your aunt Zoé.
She had all the old men dancing round her.
I'm very glad now that Marius left. He did the right thing.
You didn't love him!
Be quiet!
I shall write and tell Marius the truth.
I'll destroy every vestige of love he has for you.
Leave the poor child alone!
Tell him everything, Panisse.
He must be stupid if he still doesn't understand.
Tell him, Panisse.
What's wrong?
It's like this. Fanny finds herself in a delicate position.
She has to find a decent man to repair your sailor boy's misdeeds.
A baby.
You're expecting a baby?
And you want to steal it?
It's my child.
It's my son's baby.
You want to steal my grandchild.
You're crazy, both of you.
Fanny, think.
- I have to consider my family.
- To hell with them!
We're your family. Marius, the baby and me!
This man has nothing to do with it.
He should keep his nose out of it.
You understand?
Come along home.
You're forgetting something.
Marius won't be back for another two years.
My mother would die of shame.
People don't die that easily.
Soon people will start saying,
"Look at Fanny. She must have a bun in the oven."
Imagine mother at the market.
- Everyone will know it was Marius.
- Yes, and they know he's a nice boy.
They'll think he had his reasons for leaving.
They'll say, "He wasn't the first. He didn't know if the baby was his." Or, as you said yourself a moment ago,
"It runs in the family.
Look at her aunt Zoé."
Would you let her family suffer that?
But he'll marry her one day.
And I'm here to protect them. She'll have a husband in two years' time.
That remains to be seen.
Are you sure he'll marry Fanny when he returns?
He only wrote twice since he left.
Each time to you.
- But he always mentioned you.
- Like a stranger.
Does he mention Fanny in that letter you've just received?
No, he doesn't.
- How do you know?
- You'd have said.
And does he speak about his return?
No, he doesn't. Fanny's future and honour are at stake.
Admit it.
He didn't actually write about her.
He sent his regards.
Most considerate of him.
But I'll see to it he marries Fanny!
What good is that, even if he does return in two years?
And what if he doesn't?
How dare you think such a thing!
Well, don't you sometimes?
Are you in charge of the typhoons and cyclones? Is it you that makes the storms?
What if his ship sank?
Can you swear to it that Marius will come back and marry Fanny?
There are eight chances in ten he will.
Well, seven chances in ten.
Or six. Or five.
The child's life could be ruined.
No one knows at present.
If she marries now, the baby will have a name.
- But when he's born...
- He'd be a bastard.
That's true.
Later on, at school, his friends will say,
"My father's a baker or carpenter.
What's yours?"
He'll blush and say, "I haven't a father."
Do you think I haven't thought about it?
About my mother, my family, and the baby...
My marriage to Panisse will please everyone, including Marius.
And the child will have a name.
He'll be called Panisse.
Well, if by chance he's called Panisse, he'll be Marius Panisse.
Of course, as you'd be godfather.
Is that a promise?
You'd see him as often as you want to. He'd be yours too.
What's more, he'd be rich.
I've never owned up to it before.
I always said I had a modest fortune.
But actually I've the double.
- You're a millionaire then.
- Plus the shop.
Even Fanny didn't know.
But it could be relevant.
You'd leave it all to the child?
Of course. He'd be my son.
He'll even be richer if I leave him the bar.
At twenty, he'll be smoking cigars as long as my arm.
If it's not a girl.
A girl? Don't even mention the word!
I won't have husbands in the room.
You've done your job already.
Anyway, husbands always faint.
I'll call you when it's born. Go back to her. Quickly.
It's a premature birth.
Be sure I'm the first to kiss him.
Master Panisse says the baby is on the way.
Good.
I'll be over.
Long distance? Get me Vaison, please.
Dialling 18 at Vaison, in the Vaucluse.
Hurry up, can't you?
Where to?
My brother's baby is on the way.
A little Panisse.
Your future boss.
He'll inherit all my vineyards.
If it's a boy.
I hope it's a boy.
Of course. We'll be on the first train.
Honoré says the baby is expected tonight.
Two months premature?
What does it matter?
He'll soon be here.
But we've not finished the blanket.
- You think everything is all right?
- Of course.
We men look silly when a baby is on the way, don't we?
She's in there, in pain, while we just stand about.
I wish I could suffer in her place.
She's quiet.
She's so brave.
I was holding her hand earlier on.
The pains were so strong, she dug her nails into my palm.
Poor Panisse.
Do you think they'll let us have it?
The baby.
Will they let us have him? Of course they will.
The sun is rising.
My son's birthday.
And Easter Sunday.
He'll arrive to the sound of bells.
It's a boy!
Don't eat him up!
A bit crooked but you can read it.
Come and see.
The mother needs to rest.
I won't have you all trooping in.
He's right.
Listen, Doctor, I'm Elzéar Panisse. Wine grower, brother to Honoré and senior member of the family.
I'd like to see Fanny, just for a second.
Please, let him in. He's the head of the family.
Come on.
He's a fine boy.
Sister-in-law. I only saw you once. At your wedding.
But I address you as one of the family.
Ours is an honourable and wealthy family. But, lately, we have been a sad one as there were no children.
We knew, when we died, our name would die with us.
But then you came along. You were brought to bed and presented us with a boy.
Thank you, sister-in-law.
- How are you, Norine?
- Fine.
Panisse is a good son-in-law.
He may not be young but he spoils Fanny so much that in the end...
In the end... it's all right.
You don't regret the marriage.
No, not any longer.
She was fond of your son, but he chose to leave.
He fancied a sailor's life, the idiot.
Where is he now?
I don't know exactly.
Three weeks ago he was in India.
That reminds me, I've a letter in my pocket from him. I've not read it.
What does he say about the baby?
He doesn't know. I didn't tell him.
You did right.
Does Fanny ever speak of him?
Only in passing.
He's been gone two years now.
She's married. Her husband gave her a child.
I was amazed when she announced it.
And I was flabbergasted!
Who'd have thought it?
Who'd have thought Panisse had it in him?
He seems so calm and passive.
He must have hidden reserves.
Anyway, he made a fine boy.
Yes, he made a fine child.
He's superb. I sometimes wonder whether Marius would have done any better.
Of course he wouldn't! That much is true.
That's certainly true.
Especially when no one's around.
- Who is it?
- Me.
- Who?
- Marius.
Is that you, Marius?
It's not possible...
What's happening to me?
It's really you?
You're a bit bristly.
I need a shave.
You're like a hedgehog.
Let me look at you.
Is there a power cut?
No, a fuse blew.
You got strong!
But why are you here?
Have you jumped ship?
Are you ill?
Didn't you receive my letter?
No. Yes.
I just received it.
There's nothing wrong.
I'll explain.
You were eating?
I'm hungry.
Smells good.
How your uniform suits you!
Have a seat, child.
I can't eat alone. Go on.
I'm not hungry.
Was all this just for you?
Yes, just a little snack. Good.
That proves you're fine.
I suppose so. Eat up.
Eat it all up.
Try some tomatoes and the artichokes.
Tell me about yourself!
Well, when we reached Sydney, about eight weeks ago, we had serious problems.
He's a bit feverish.
A little feverish, yes.
He's teething.
It's one of the molars at the back.
You can feel it.
That's children for you.
They always have something.
He was fretful yesterday.
- Where are you going?
- To Paris.
After those motors?
Yes, to sign a contract.
I'll be their sole agent.
You're going to sell motors, you a sail maker?
It's treason!
I know. But I'm doing it for the boy.
Take these to my wife and tell her I caught the train.
Farewell, Panisse.
Have a good trip!
Who's there?
Don't be afraid, Fanny. It's me, Marius.
It's you!
I came back tonight.
I've seen my father. I wanted to talk to you.
I wanted to say hello.
You're alone?
I went to bed but I couldn't sleep.
So I jumped out of the window just as I used to.
Like in the old days.
I've been outside quite some time.
Sit down.
Have a drink.
With pleasure.
Won't your husband have one too?
He's already in bed.
Have you come back for good?
In principle, I leave in the morning, two hours from now.
Your ship is here?
No, she's in Sydney...
in dry dock being repaired.
A warship was on its way home, so they sent us back on it with some equipment that was damaged.
These are devices that have to be repaired by the makers in Paris.
Precision instruments, you see.
It's all highly scientific.
I asked to be part of the team.
I was homesick.
Of course. You would be homesick for your father.
For my father and Marseilles.
For everyone.
But I could stay if I exchanged postings.
What do you mean?
I could easily swap.
Because the pay on The Malaisie is very good.
Chauveau and I have always kept in touch.
He's on the Corsica run but he'd take my place like a shot.
He has the same craving.
For faraway places.
You don't crave for them any more?
You're not happy at sea?
If it's the life you choose, you have to like it.
You'd be silly otherwise.
Of course I'm happy.
What about you?
Yes, I have a good husband.
And a nice home.
A nice home and a lovely child.
A truly lovely child.
- Your father told you?
- Yes, but only just now.
What else did he say?
- About what?
- About my son.
What else should he say?
I suppose you think your son is wonderful and unique.
Of course. And he is.
He's beginning to walk.
Already?
My father said he was only eight months old.
That's a bit soon.
He's a little over eight months and he's very precocious.
You're very happy then.
It's all worked out well.
I'm glad to see you so happy and looking so well.
You look well too.
- Thanks to the sea air.
- Thanks to a quiet life, in my case.
And happiness.
Yes, Marius, my quiet life and happiness.
Well, goodbye Fanny, my dear.
You'll be back after Paris?
No, we're sailing on a British steamer.
They're good boats.
Tell your husband I was sorry to miss him.
Madame Panisse, I've a message for you.
These flowers are from your husband.
You see, it was like this.
We were just leaving this party given for railway employees...
Let me speak.
By now the express will have left. Monsieur Panisse will be on his way to Paris.
May the Good Lord protect him.
May Our Lady watch over him.
Amen.
Is that true about your husband?
Why didn't you say?
Scared of me?
Of course not.
It's no use talking. Go away.
We mustn't stir up the past.
We don't have to. It's already stirred up.
Why did you marry in haste?
Why wasn't I told about your son?
How is it Panisse suddenly became a father at fifty?
I don't know.
- After only seven months. - How do you know? So his baptism card says.
It gives the date of his baptism and the birth.
He was premature.
These things happen.
Yes, these things happen.
But you said he was eight months old and he's ten.
You wanted to stop me having ideas.
It's no use.
I know the truth now.
That child is mine, isn't it?
And I'm a criminal.
No, you're not a criminal.
Why did you let me go without saying?
Why didn't you write?
You left for five years!
For mother's sake, I told Honoré.
He took me as I was.
Forgive me.
I forgave you a long time ago.
You just didn't understand my love.
Nor my own.
I didn't know how much I loved you.
At first, I was happy on that ship.
I know. I read your letter.
I hardly thought about you. It was all over.
But then it started to come back.
Especially at night.
I kept thinking of you.
Stop it, Marius.
I began to realise I'd been stupid.
But I thought I could put it behind me. It would soon be over.
But, no, it wouldn't go away.
As we entered the South Seas, it grew worse and worse.
When I closed my eyes, it all flooded back.
I saw you with your big straw hat.
I saw you on the quay.
I heard the click of your sabots.
I smelled your skin.
Stop it, Marius. You mustn't. It's not right.
It's too late now. I saw you everywhere.
Then, one day off the Carolinas, a terrible thing happened.
Try as I might, I couldn't remember your face.
I couldn't remember you any more.
I closed my eyes and tried with might and main.
But it was all black.
I'd lost you.
So I asked Dad to send me a photograph of you.
And when we arrived at Tahiti, there was the mail.
Dad had sent a photograph.
Your wedding photograph.
You'd been married a month.
As I didn't know the reason, I wept.
I did too.
I had to see if you still loved me.
You still do. I was right.
You still love me.
Fanny, darling, let me kiss you.
No, children. Don't do it.
Panisse is a good man. Don't make a fool of him in his own home.
Who told you?
A little bird, as usual.
Why didn't you say the child was mine?
The child?
What child?
- I told him.
- Maybe that was wrong.
I've some right over her... and over the child.
I don't know about any rights.
I'm very fond of you, Dad, but keep out of this.
You said that well, Marius.
You've become a real man.
You no longer respect your father.
But, in the absence of Fanny's husband, you've no right to be here.
Get out.
I'm staying here!
You'll follow your father.
Panisse did a fine thing.
He gave Fanny a home.
He gave your son a name.
Now he's away, working for your child's future, are you going to come like a thief and steal his wife?
Our family has done many things.
There have been pirates, smugglers, fools, and even a simple barman like me.
But never a scoundrel.
Are you staying?
Right. Then I stay too.
Your father is right.
My husband!
Working late? You missed the train?
No but as I was boarding, I saw Dr Cigalon.
And he told me that...
As you see, we have visitors.
Good evening, Marius.
You're back?
Only for a few hours.
Tell us.
Did you miss the train?
Dr Cigalon told me Miette's child has whooping cough.
And she'd not said anything to us.
She'd been borrowing toys.
She only brought this doll back yesterday.
Whooping cough is a terrible disease.
It's an invisible germ, tinier than a mosquito.
Look as you may, you can't see it.
It has terrible hooks.
It jumps on children and clamps on their throats. They suffer terribly.
Did he touch this?
How is the boy?
A bit hot.
I'll give that girl Miette a piece of my mind when I see her tomorrow.
Don't worry.
Go and take his temperature.
How long will you be on leave?
That depends.
On your captain?
It depends on Fanny and you.
At least that's clear and frank.
I don't understand.
In the past, as today, and even when I was far away, I always considered Fanny my fiancée.
"Considered"?
That's a fine word.
But I don't need to consider anything.
Fanny is simply my wife. My wife and the mother of my child.
Are you sure he's your son?
For two years I've been expecting this.
I've never gone to bed without thinking,
"What if he comes and wants them?
What will I say?"
Over two years, I've had time to choose my words, but now you're here, I don't know what to say.
Honoré, don't worry. He doesn't look ill.
- His temperature?
- Normal.
He's no more sickening for whooping cough than I am.
Sit down, Fanny.
What is it you want exactly?
I made a mistake two years ago.
But why should this ruin several people's lives?
- What people?
- Fanny, me, dad and my son. What about me?
You have had two good years and I'm grateful for what you did.
But now you must give me back what is mine.
That's pushing it a bit.
It's easy asking others to make sacrifices.
Well, here's my answer.
I feel an intruder when I see you together.
Maybe I should do the decent thing and kill myself.
I'd willingly die for you, Fanny. But if I died, I'd never see my boy again.
So I absolutely refuse to do it.
No one is asking you to.
No one has asked me but I asked myself.
Don't feel pity for me.
If you still love this young man, forget me. You're free to go.
What you say is very fine and unselfish but there's the child.
The child is ours!
You want me to give him up?
Have my eyes, my heart but not him!
So much for your generosity.
You give the wife but keep the child.
You calculate the wife won't leave without the child!
If you're sincere, give me back my son.
No, Marius, you will not have the boy!
You may persuade his mother.
Or she may ask for him one day but don't you try.
You're young. You can have other children.
Let me keep mine.
He's my only son, the first and last!
I would never take him from you.
An ordinary child I might part with but this one is a marvel.
Marius, you were a handsome boy but he's even more handsome.
All this is very fine but...
He coughed.
I heard nothing.
You may not have heard but I did.
And he's gone.
The cough is more important than all this.
If he's mine, I should do the worrying.
Exactly. But you don't.
Marius, he's not yours.
You were only his father before he was born.
Once a father, always a father.
When the baby was born, he weighed four kilos.
Four kilos of his mother's flesh.
Now he weighs nine kilos.
Do you know what those other kilos are made of?
Love.
And yet love weighs very light.
You need a lot of love to make five kilos.
I gave my share and so did Fanny.
But Panisse contributed the most.
And what have you given?
Life.
Dogs give life too.
No, Marius. You didn't want that child.
All you wanted was pleasure.
You didn't give him life. He took it.
That's a different thing.
Who's the father?
The giver of life or the one who buys the baby food?
The father is the one who loves.
Marius, you were the father of a bastard.
You were the father of a child without a name which was borne by a poor, desperate girl.
Where is that child?
He isn't mine.
Mine was born in a fine, large bed, surrounded by his family.
Don't try to bite off more than you can chew.
You can't have that child.
He's too firmly rooted in his family.
You're betraying me too.
No, Marius, I never betrayed you.
I have never betrayed our love.
Since your father is here to save us from ourselves, I can tell you.
I love you. I still love you.
I love you as much as before, if not more.
Every morning, I see you in my son's face.
When you came in tonight, I nearly fainted.
If you'd have taken my hand, I would have gone with you.
I'd have gone with you anywhere.
But then...
What about my son?
Take him.
The law and God forbid it.
Panisse saved me.
He gave me his name and my self-respect back.
At the birth, I drove my nails into his hands.
He said, "Bite me, scratch me.
"The more you hurt me, the more he's mine."
And he bore with it the whole night.
He still bears the scars.
He bears the scars, Marius.
Not you.
Go back to sea. That's what you wanted.
Leave me here with our child.
But remember this, if it will console you. There's someone thinking of you every night.
And you... What do you want me to do?
Catch your train.
You want me gone too.
She can't wait for me to be gone either.
Don't be hard on her.
She loves you.
But her heart goes one way and her body the other.
It's not her heart that loves you.
She's the most to be pitied.
None of us is sending you away, neither me, her or Panisse.
But you're a danger to your child's future.
He's the one sending you away.
And you don't defend me.
Dad, you don't love me any more.
Of course I still love you.
Only you're a big man and he's little.
He's very little.
That's what makes him strong.
Small children take everything.
But it's nicer not to wait for them to take things.
Just give instead.
Say goodbye to Madame Panisse.
I'll only ever love you.
And I've only ever loved you.
Come along, my son.
Driver.
- Driver, stop! - What troubles you in there?
Why do you want to stop?
The man up there, he is bleeding to death.
Can't stop. Not here.
Brakes won't hold.
Orderly.
And just as guilty as a soldier would be, who deserted his post under fire.
Now, in making an example of you, I...
I beg your pardon, sir. I have some wounded outside.
I am looking for the...
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
You want the Italian unit.
We're the English here, you see.
Yes, Number 207.
They're in the other wing. Moved in today.
Yes, out that way, straight ahead.
- Thank you, Major.
What's the girlfriend been doing?
Typical male conceit!
I think they're going to send her back home. That's a dirty shame.
- She'll be disgraced.
- It's regulations.
At least they might let her have her baby here.
If they send her back now, all her friends will know. - And her family.
- She's only herself to blame.
This is war, Fergy, and she loved him.
Shh, here they come.
Well, is it necessary for us all to be here at one time?
Get back to your posts.
You will be packed and ready to leave within the hour.
Molly?
Can I help you pack?
I guess so.
Why, of course I want to.
- Good girl. - I beg your pardon?
I say, she's the only human being in the whole lot of us.
I'm sorry Miss Barkley appears to sympathise with one who has disgraced the uniform we all wear.
- Rinaldi!
- Frederico!
- Get away. You're filthy.
You Anglo-Saxons! You're not too clean yourself.
Did you bring me some good cases, baby?
Did you have trouble finding us? - No. - How do you feel?
- Is there going to be an offensive?
- There's not... Were you under fire?
Madonna, but I worried about you!
Yes, I can see how much you've been worrying.
Seven operations today, baby.
And one of them was beautiful.
I took the heart out.
It lay in my hand and it beat like this.
You should have seen it.
It was lovely!
Soon, Rinaldi will be the best surgeon in all the corps.
Then, in all the army.
And some day, in all of Italy.
- Why not in all the world? - Why not?
You will like it here, baby.
What sort of a town is this? Any girls?
Many beautiful English nurses.
- No, I mean, girls.
- Girls, too, a house full of them.
Another Villa Rossa?
Some of them have never been to the front before.
Perhaps.
But the nurses are much nicer. The most beautiful is Miss Barkley.
I am in love with her.
- Does she know it?
- Have you any money? - Yes.
- Lend me 50 lire. - What for?
I want to make on Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient wealth.
You are my great and good friend and financial protector.
And you're an ass.
And now we will eat and drink, and I will take you to meet Miss Barkley.
But you must make for me a good impression upon her.
Now, listen... But you must.
And you can have a nurse, too.
There is another one named Miss Ferguson. She is also very, very nice. - No.
First, we will eat and drink, and then we'll go and see the girls who have never been to the front before.
Yes?
You know what an American is? - Yes.
- What is it?
She doesn't know.
- Well, I'm an American.
- Then what are you doing here?
- Drinking, mostly.
- He liked the uniform.
I liked their language.
Then what were you doing in Italy?
Studying.
Studying what?
Architecture.
You know what that is? - Yes.
You see, she doesn't know.
- Neither do I. - Oh, you've had too much wine.
It's filthy wine.
It takes the enamel off your teeth and leaves it on the roof of your mouth.
- Where was I?
- Architecture.
Look... I'll explain.
This, my dear, is called an arch.
The arch, my dear, is perhaps the oldest of architectural devices.
Arch.
Architecture.
The very word will tell you how inextricably the two are one.
In a word, my dear, architecture is the most ancient of the arts.
Just as yours is the most ancient of the professions.
You'd better put your shoe on, or you'll get cold feet.
If you please, I'd like to go now.
The air raid seems to be over.
Catherine!
- Oh, I worried. Oh!
- You think I'd been blown away? - I didn't know what to think.
Nobody saw where you went.
Who's that man?
Oh, I don't know. Some lunatic.
What if we take the mountains to the north?
Behind them are more mountains, and behind those, more yet.
And we take them all only if the Austrians stop fighting.
One side must stop. - Stop?
It will go on forever. - Like him.
The Priest wants the Austrians to win the war. - No, no, no.
It is not true.
- But you don't want us to attack.
If we must have war, I suppose we have to attack.
Oh, but so many die that way.
But what is death to a Christian.
Don't encourage him, Fergy.
Frederico.
- Oh, you are back safe. - Hello, Father.
- I am so glad.
- The Priest prayed for you, Frederico. - Every time you go out he does the same.
- Oh, I pray for you all.
You are late, baby.
How is it up there? Quiet?
You nearly missed the party. But it is very dull.
But Miss Barkley is here, and her friend Miss Ferguson.
The one you will like.
Miss Barkley, permit me to present to you my friend and war brother, Lieutenant Henry.
He has just returned back from the front.
How do you do?
And this is Miss Ferguson. - How do you do?
Now he begins again, that fellow.
Quick, let us go into the garden.
Now, you stay here.
I will find something for us to drink.
Asti? Grappa? Vermouth?
- All of them.
Then you shall have all of them.
- Nice out here. - Hmm, isn't it?
We seem fated to bump into each other in the dark.
I'm sorry about that.
I mistook you for someone else.
- I had been drinking.
- I gathered that, too.
- Mad?
- You're an American, aren't you?
Well, then what are you doing in the Italian army?
It's not really the army, it's only the ambulance.
It's very odd, though. Why did you do it?
I don't know. Why did you?
Oh, I joined up in England.
Besides, the boy I was engaged to had gone across.
- Where is Miss Ferguson?
- Why don't you go see?
Yes, do bring her out, Captain Rinaldi.
- Have some? - Thanks.
He's sore.
Because I'm here with you.
Women prefer him, as a rule.
Shall we take a walk?
Yes, let's.
Where is he now? - Who?
- The boy you're engaged to.
- He's dead. - Oh.
He was killed in the Somme.
Were you engaged long? Eight years.
We grew up together.
Why didn't you marry?
I didn't know what the war was like then.
If I had it to do over again, I'd marry him, or anything.
Shot through the shoulder.
Something picturesque.
This is a picturesque front. Not France.
He didn't have a sabre cut.
They blew him to bits.
What are you thinking about now?
About whisky.
What about whisky?
About how nice it is.
And you're nice, too.
- No, don't.
- No, please!
Did I hurt you?
It's all right.
I'm dreadfully sorry. Really.
I just couldn't bear the nurses'-evening-off aspect of it.
It's quite all right. I don't mind at all.
Poor man.
You see, I've been leading a funny sort of life.
Besides, you're so very beautiful.
You don't have to talk a lot of nonsense, I said I'm sorry.
We could get along.
Couldn't we?
You're sweet. - No, I'm not.
- Yes, you're a dear.
I'd be very glad to have you kiss me now, if you don't mind.
You are looking for someone?
- Have you seen Miss Barkley? - Miss Barkley?
- Didn't she go out there with you? - With me?
- No, no, no.
- But just a little while ago...
I thought I saw her go out to the garden gate with the Lieutenant Henry.
She went out with an officer? Alone?
Well, perhaps I was mistaken, you know, it is quite dark out there.
Oh, she wouldn't do that. No.
No, I am sure I was mistaken.
Where is she, then?
You're a grand girl. I'm a crazy girl.
- Why?
- To stay out here.
It's nice.
Isn't that enough?
I suppose that has to be enough for people who are living as we live.
Back home, I'd have courted you and sent you flowers.
Out here, you crowd it all into one hour.
Isn't that the way it's got to be, out here?
Tomorrow morning I've got to go up to the front again.
And if a shell got me and you never saw me again, then we'd both be sorry that we've been so formal and waited.
Besides, what's there so fine in putting it off, dragging it out, - giving me your lips tonight...
- No... - ...your throat tomorrow...
- No. No, wait.
No, please...
No...
Catherine?
- I...
- I hope you are not worried about Miss Barkley. It's not like her to disappear this way.
Well, perhaps she felt ill and went home alone.
Good night.
Come, girls, come.
Why didn't you tell me?
If it had to happen, I'd rather it were like this. I couldn't know.
In a church or out under the stars.
- "Why not"?
There's a war on.
And tonight, who cares, and tomorrow, who knows.
What did you say your name was?
If you knew how I was back home, you'd see the funny side of it. Please, stop it.
We blame everything on the war, but that's rot.
It's something in ourselves.
The lady sat in the public square and mourned her lost innocence.
Don't be sorry.
I'm not.
Oh, darling.
Did you have a nice, uh, time, baby?
You made progress with her, eh? We're friends.
If that's what you mean. I mean, uh...
Was she nice to you, practically speaking? - Shut up!
- I am a man of extreme delicacy,
- but was she... - Rinaldi!
Will you please shut up?
If you wanna be a friend of mine, shut up.
I am your best friend and your war brother.
Then shut up.
Miss Barkley prefers you to me. That is very clear.
But Miss Ferguson is very nice, too.
You like her?
That you of all people...
A lot of geese, that's what you are! Silly geese!
Stuffed with bunk about woman's part in the war.
We must bring solace to the men who fight, sacrifice ourselves, give ourselves.
If you'd known him for a long time, or been in love with him...
But you only met him tonight.
How long must you know a man before you can love him?
Are you pretending to be in love with that man?
I think I am, Fergy.
I must be.
Or it couldn't have happened.
You're just another conquest to him. One in a hundred.
You'll probably never see him again.
He said if he'd met me back home, he'd have courted me, sent me flowers...
But now... I suppose I won't ever see him again.
Ciao, baby.
Good luck.
- Back?
Yes, back!
- I wanna see Miss Barkley.
- She's on duty.
Wait, you can't go in there.
Hey, why have you come back in here for? The Tenente, he knows what he's doing.
Please. What's wrong, Bonello?
Going to ever get started here? We got plenty of time.
Oh, the...
What are you doing here? We come back, Signor Capitano.
Tenente forgot something. Oh.
You're all right, aren't you?
Yes, I'm all right.
I came to... I thought...
You see... I...
I'm going to be away for a while, and I didn't want you to think that I'd just gone away.
What I mean is,
I'd hate to have you feel that... That it wasn't important to me. About...
About us.
Uh, I don't exactly know how to say it.
You've said it very nicely, dear, thank you.
No, I don't mean...
- Will you be gone long?
No. Only a few days. There's gonna be a show above...
Up above Plava. Nothing much, I guess. A show?
You'll be careful, won't you?
I won't get hit.
Here.
It's a Saint Anthony.
They say a Saint Anthony is very useful to guard you from harm.
I'll take good care of him.
I wish I could kiss you.
He is my friend and a good soldier.
I do not like to see him lose his head over a woman.
Aren't you exaggerating a bit?
I think not.
Couldn't we send her back to the base, Major?
Oh, if you could send her away, it would simplify everything.
Could perhaps send her to Milan.
Excellent, my dear Major!
Magnificent! No wonder the English are first in diplomacy.
Er, what did you say her name was?
We won't get anything else to eat once the attack starts.
This is all they've given me.
Starting to eat, Tenente?
No, we'll all eat together.
Come on, sit down to it.
Wash it down with wine, Tenente.
Who goes to the attack?
Bersaglieri.
If nobody would attack, the war would be over.
That was a big one.
- Four hundred twenty?
- No, 305.
- Sounded like a Skoda to me.
- Skoda, that's what I say.
Are you badly hit, Tenente?
Anybody hurt?
My leg.
Hold my neck, Tenente.
You were right, Tenente. It was a Skoda gun.
Lacerations of the scalp and possible fracture of the skull.
Multiple superficial wounds of the left and right thigh, left and right knee, and right foot.
Profound wounds of right knee and foot incurred in line of duty.
Anti-tetanus, please.
- Come on, lift him up a little more. - All right.
Hurry, hurry!
How do you feel, baby?
Rinaldi. What are you doing here?
Bonello telephoned me.
The Major gave me permission to come.
No one shall hurt you, baby. I won't let them.
No butcher is going to touch my war brother.
Only Rinaldi can take you and never hurt you.
You must forgive me, baby, for talking so much, but I am... I'm very moved to see you badly wounded.
I will see you are decorated for bravery.
Perhaps we can get you the medaglia d'argento, but surely the bronze one.
Did you carry somebody on your back?
I didn't carry anybody. I couldn't move.
Surely there was something heroic.
Tell me what you did.
I was blown up eating cheese.
Don't worry, baby.
I will fix you so that you are as good as new. You will see.
Every day, I learn to do things smoother, quicker.
Soon, very soon, you will be walking again.
I brought a present for you. You will find it under your blanket, next to your heart.
It is a bottle of brandy, baby. Very good brandy.
The infantry captured it from the Austrians on San Gabriele.
I have another surprise for you.
Take a deep breath.
Where do you think you will go from here?
To the Italian hospital where they have the male nurses with the beards?
I will arrange everything with my friend, the British Major.
You will go to Milan. To the beautiful Miss Barkley.
That makes you happy, huh?
Think of Rinaldi, left all alone with the war.
No one to make fun of.
No one to lend him money.
While you... While you are in Milan with the beautiful Miss Barkley.
Making love in Milan to the chaste Miss Barkley.
Look out for the step.
Why do you stop?
I am the superintendent. May I have your medical papers, please?
They're in my coat.
In the buttoned-down pocket.
Take him up those stairs, down the corridor.
His room is the one at the end.
You show them, Giulio.
I am the porter, Signor Tenente.
Come, follow me.
Now, Signor Tenente, we must lift you off the bed. - All right.
But keep my legs straight.
- Si, Signor Tenente.
Anything more, Signor Tenente? - Get me some brandy.
- No, it's not allowed, Signor Tenente.
Wasn't I wounded, fighting for the glory of Italy?
- You'll find some money in my pocket.
- So it's you. - Ferguson.
- Is Catherine here?
- As if you didn't know. I believe that's why you got wounded.
- Where is she?
- You ought to be still.
Here's your chart.
I must take your temperature.
Does she know I'm here?
Under the arm, please.
- Hello, darling.
You're lovely.
- Are you badly hurt?
- You're lovely. Oh, my poor darling.
It's your leg, isn't it?
- You're the loveliest thing I ever saw. - Oh...
I have to go now, darling, I can't stay. - You'll come back?
- Later.
- But we have to be awfully careful. - You've got to come back.
I will, when I can.
- Tonight?
- I'll try.
Somebody's coming.
I'll take that thermometer now.
Good gracious!
Fetch the doctor.
It's a miracle you're not delirious with such a fever.
- I haven't got any fever.
- Stay quiet, please.
I have brought you a few little things.
And this is mosquito netting, and this is a bottle of vermouth.
You like vermouth, huh?
- And these are English papers.
- Thank you, Father.
It's very good of you to come. Oh, but I mustn't stay long.
They warned me not to tire you.
You seem very tired yourself.
I am tired, but I have no right to be.
- You have the war disgust.
But I hate the war.
- I don't enjoy it.
- But you do not mind it. You do not see it.
Oh, you must forgive me.
I know you are wounded.
That was an accident.
Still, even wounded, you do not see it. I can tell.
I do not see it myself, but I feel it a little.
Come in, Cat.
Don't go yet, Father.
It's still early.
You are sure?
With the operation in the morning, he should rest.
Oh, he's strong.
He has such a lovely temperature. It is always normal.
I'm very proud of his temperature.
Maybe all our children will have fine temperatures, too.
Our children will probably have beastly temperatures.
Don't mind us, Father.
I could see it in your faces.
You approve, don't you, Father?
You spoke of children.
This, too, is the war.
Without the war, you would have married in God's grace.
Is it not so?
I hadn't thought about it like that, but...
Father, are you...
Is that the marriage service?
Of course you realise, Father, that army regulations prevent us from marrying?
They'd send Catherine home.
Poor Cat.
Such a crazy marriage.
At least I'm in white.
No orange blossoms.
I can smell them.
No organ music.
I can hear it plainly.
It was a foolish notion, perhaps.
I have not the right to say you are married.
Yet, it has made me happy to do this.
For now, from my heart, I can say I bless you in His name.
Goodbye and be happy, both of you.
- Give my regards to the mess.
- I will.
And get well soon.
I will come again the next time I am in Milan.
- Goodbye, my dear.
Is Miss Barkley here?
- Please, darling.
We mustn't.
Your operation's in the morning.
You'll have to take your oil.
Castor oil? No.
You'll take it from me.
- I'll take anything from you... - Darling. ...if you stay.
Oh, darling, darling.
I want what you want.
There isn't any "me" any more, just what you want.
You're sweet.
Don't I make a lovely wife?
Such a lovely wife.
Feel our hearts beat.
No wonder my heart beats.
I'm mad about you.
That's the opera I made my debut in at La Scala.
- They threw benches at him.
- That's a lie!
Yes, they did.
I threw six benches myself.
Oh, now he is offended.
He'll get over it.
That's his sore spot. We always tease him.
You don't care whom you hurt.
Now, don't you get mad, too.
Catherine and I were thinking of asking you to our wedding.
- You'll never get married.
- We will!
No, you won't. You'll fight before you marry.
- Oh, we never fight. - You've time yet.
We won't fight ever.
You'll die, then.
Fight or die. That's what people do. - They don't marry.
I'm not crying.
Maybe you'll be all right, you two.
Watch out you don't get her in trouble.
- I won't get her into trouble.
- You better not.
Or I'll kill you.
What is the matter with her?
She doesn't like me, that's all.
Oh, no. She just likes me more.
Are you on night duty tonight?
Yes, but you won't care. You'll go right off to sleep.
You wait and see.
Darling, how many other girls have you ever loved?
How many, really?
How many have you, um... How do you say it... Loved?
- None.
- You're lying to me.
- Of course. - Oh, that's right.
You just keep right on lying, that's what I want you to do.
Were they pretty?
I have never been with anyone.
That's right, darling.
What were they like?
I don't know anything about it.
You're just mine. That's true.
You've never belonged to anyone else.
I don't care if you have, though. I'm not afraid of them.
Only, don't tell me about them.
You never told them you loved them, did you? - No.
- I knew you wouldn't.
- Oh, darling, I do love you.
- Then, kiss me.
- Right here on the street?
I'll go in first.
What is this, if I may ask?
What was in it?
That's kummel.
That's the best kind. It comes in those bear-shaped bottles from Russia.
And these?
That's brandy, wine and whisky.
And I've been pitying you for being wounded.
Pity is something that is wasted on you.
- If you're so anxious not to go back to the front, I should think you'd try something more intelligent.
Not self-inflicted alcoholism!
- I said, "Alcoholism!"
And I also say that I'll see your convalescent leave is cancelled.
You'll go back to the front tomorrow night.
Have I time for a drink before the train leaves?
- For the front? - Yes.
- About 20 minutes, Signor Capitano.
It's a fine room, a lovely room.
It's all right.
The red plush is just the thing.
Those mirrors are very attractive, too.
People who go in for vice seem to have very good taste about it.
Hmm, you're a grand girl.
I wish we could do something really simple.
Everything we do seems so innocent and right.
You're a fine, simple girl.
I am a simple girl.
Nobody but you ever realised it.
At first, I thought you were a crazy girl.
I was a little crazy at first.
Was that your train?
It makes up at Turin. But it stays in the station here until time to leave.
There's really lots of time.
"But at my back, I always hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near"
I know that poem. It's by Marvell.
Oh, it's about a girl who wouldn't live with a man.
It's only the rain.
I hate the rain.
I like it.
I'm afraid of the rain.
- Afraid, why?
- Well, perhaps it's silly.
- No. Don't make me.
- Tell me.
I'm afraid of the rain because sometimes I see me dead in it.
And sometimes I see you dead in it.
- That's more likely. - Oh, now, darling, don't say that.
That is your train.
Time's winged chariot.
I'll come with you, hmm?
No, please, I don't want you...
Not at the station.
All right, darling.
How often will you write?
As often as I can.
Do they read your letters?
They can't read English enough to hurt anything.
Well, I'll make them very confusing.
But not too confusing.
Oh, I should have got you a going-away gift.
A whistle to make you feel better in the dark. Or a sword.
I'm sure we could get a used sword very cheap.
Swords aren't very useful at the front.
Oh, I see, they get in the way of your legs when you're running.
They might be useful at mess, though.
I'm afraid I have to start, darling.
I hate to leave our fine house.
So do I.
We never stay settled very long in a home, do we?
We will.
I'll have a fine home for you when you come back.
Say, "I'll come back to Catherine."
I'll come back to Catherine.
I'll always come back.
Maybe this time, you'll be hurt just a little in the foot.
- Or the lobe of the ear. - Oh, no, no, no.
I want your ears just the way they are.
Your feet have been hurt already.
I want a ticket to Switzerland, please. - To where, signora, to what town?
- The nearest one to Italy.
That would be Brissago, signora.
- Then give me a ticket to Brissago.
Oh, Fergy, I was afraid you wouldn't come.
Would you mind telling me what this is all about? - So I gathered by this, but where?
Why?
To Switzerland, to have a baby.
I knew he'd get you in trouble. Oh, now, it wasn't his fault, really, Fergy.
What's he going to do about it?
He doesn't know it.
You didn't tell him?
What would be the good? It would only worry him.
He'd have to go anyway.
Aren't you going to tell him?
Well, not yet.
I may write him from Switzerland.
- You're a fool.
- On Track 3. - Thank you.
What's the hurry? Why tonight?
I couldn't go back to that hospital. I couldn't stand it. Not with him gone.
But you'll be all alone in Switzerland.
Don't worry, Fergy, I'll be all right.
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Only of going back to that hospital.
Don't scold me, Fergy.
I'll carry it.
"I've always told you I was a crazy girl.
"I couldn't bear Milan with you away.
"So I've chucked the war and come to live in this little Swiss town
"as near as possible to the Italian border and you.
"And, darling, it's an adorable place and we'll be very happy here.
"I've taken a suite...
"...suite in the best hotel.
"And I'm fairly wallowing in luxury.
"The bed is Empire and fit for an empress.
"There's a maroon velvet carpet, ankle-deep,
"and a bathroom... Oh, darling, the bathroom!
"It's of black marble with silver fittings.
"I've just dined in state at my sitting-room window,
"from which there is a divine view of the lake shimmering in moonlight."
I'm an awful liar, darling.
It's not really a nice place at all. It's mean, cheap and horrible.
But it doesn't matter where I live, because I don't really live at all when I'm not with you.
Oh, darling...
What I really wanna tell you is that... That I shall lie awake in the dark and cry, because you're not here.
I'm lonely and frightened.
And I love you.
- Hurry, baby.
- Go where?
But I told you before, to the Villa Rossa.
- New girls. Everybody's going.
- Not me.
But you must. It will be a fine party.
And, besides, I said you would go.
I can't. I've got to write a letter.
Oh, to that little...
Every day, more letters.
You might as well be married.
That's my business.
How you ever come back to me?
Serious like a shopkeeper with a liver.
Where is my war brother who used to get drunk with me and go to the Villa Rossa every night?
Leave me alone, will you?
Why? Isn't she just a girl?
Keep her out of this.
Sacred subject.
Believe me, baby, sacred subjects are not good for soldiers.
Why don't you be like me?
All fire and smoke.
And nothing inside.
- Come on, baby.
- You're drunk, stop it.
Of course I am drunk!
You come with me and you will be drunk, too.
Come on, baby.
Oh, I am sorry.
Now you must come.
There is no more ink.
Get your hands off me and get out!
Poor baby.
Tomorrow I will get you drunk and I will take out your liver and I will put you in a good Italian liver and make a man of you again.
You're going out, Signor Capitano?
- Yes, why?
- The mail just came, Signor Capitano.
- You censor it.
- Signor capitano...
The officers' mail, too?
Aren't you gonna open them, Signor Capitano?
- Send this one back.
And today my letters came back. Every one I'd ever written to her.
Came back?
Just marked "Return to sender. Person unknown."
Well, that's very strange.
Thirty-two letters. She never got one.
- Well, that's why she never wrote you.
She'd have written me anyway. Something's happened to her.
- Have you tried to... - I can't get any information at all.
- I've got to go and find her myself.
- How can you?
I'm going to Milan. I'll find her.
But aren't all leaves of absence forbidden since that battle in the north began?
- I'm going anyway.
- No, that's desertion.
- I don't care, I'm going.
- You'll be caught.
- You mustn't do this, Frederico.
- Yes, I must.
That's what I wanted to tell you, Padre.
What does this war mean to me any more?
What does anything mean, but finding her?
- But Frederico, consider the... - I can depend on you, Padre?
Say goodbye to Rinaldi and the others for me.
- When are you leaving?
- Now. While they are at dinner.
And by morning, when they miss me, I'll be halfway to Milan.
If they ask me, what will I say?
I... Anything you like.
Goodbye, Padre.
Goodbye, Frederico.
May the Lord bless and preserve you.
What are you carabinieri doing in the yards?
- Looking for stragglers.
- What do you do with them?
Send them back to fight invaders.
Every foot of Italian soil must be regained.
Suppose they don't want to go back?
Then we shoot them.
- Who's that? Shh!
Where's Catherine?
- What are you doing back here?
- Where's Catherine? I know. You've run away.
You're a deserter.
- Where is she? I've got to see her.
- You can't.
- Gone? Where?
- And you'd better get out.
- Has she been transferred?
- If you don't get out of here, I'll scream and bring the whole hospital down on you.
- Why'd she go.
Where?
- Tell me where she is!
- Go ahead, choke me, but I won't tell you. You've done her enough harm.
- I said you'd get her into trouble.
Hate, you understand?
I won't tell you anything.
I hope they catch you. I hope they shoot you!
Pay you back for what you've done to her. Making her have a baby.
- I warned you, but you didn't care. Not about her.
- Now she's had to go away.
- Where?
Where? Oh, for pity's sake, tell me!
And get me some clothes. A full outfit.
I can't go around in this uniform.
As long as I don't get mixed up in it myself.
You won't.
I just want you to get some things, and put an advertisement in the newspaper for me.
I really oughtn't to, if I had any sense.
I know I shall have awful gas pains in the morning as a result of this.
Just say...
"Catherine, where are you?
"I am free at last.
"Meet me at the Palace Hotel, Stresa."
Signed "Frederic."
The Major made an obituary speech in your memory and the Priest, - he wanted to say mass for your soul.
- But what... Vermouth.
One for you?
Uh, two vermouth. You see, we all thought you were dead.
It never occurred to us that you might have be shell-shocked, wandered away, lost your memory.
I saw your advertisement in the paper.
But as soon as we knew, we arranged everything.
Rinaldi will work on you one of his miraculous cures.
You will go back a hero.
I'm not going back.
They will decorate you for bravery.
They will even promote you.
No. I'm through with the war.
Get that straight. But you cannot do that!
You cannot just stop and say, "I'm through with the war."
Can I speak to you a moment, sir?
- It's all right, Harry, he's my friend.
- But I, uh... He keeps telling me that it's dangerous for me to stay here any longer.
The policeman was in tonight.
He spoke of notifying the carabinieri.
- When will they come?
- Tonight, tomorrow, who knows?
But soon. My boat is still ready, sir.
Thank you, Harry.
If they arrest you, no one can save you.
- They will shoot you.
Look...
Get this through your head, I'm not going back!
I've got to wait here until I can find Catherine.
And how do you expect to do that?
I've got some people looking for her.
- If that is more important than...
My baby.
So...
And that means everything to you.
Yes, it would.
It means that I've got to find her and get her out of Italy.
- Perhaps she's no longer in Italy.
- What makes you say that?
She is in Switzerland.
Where?
Will you do one for me, too?
Yes, madam.
No.
Isn't there any mail for me, yet?
Ah, madam!
Yes, yes. Today there are letters.
- Many letters.
Oh! - Twenty, madam.
- Twenty!
It is up the lake and across.
- About 35 kilometres.
- I'll make it.
At the frontier, there will be sentries.
- And you will have to watch out
- for patrol boats.
- If it blows too hard, you...
Have you enough money?
Won't you need it?
There must be a Villa Rossa in Pordenone.
Always the same girls until they become like old friends.
Like war comrades.
Take it, baby, please.
Please. You're a good egg, Rinin.
No, I am not a good egg.
I am a fool.
But if I had understood how you felt about her...
Good luck, baby.
- Shall I get a new cylinder, Doctor?
Oh, I wanted so to have this baby and not make any trouble.
And now I'm all done.
All gone to pieces.
She is losing strength fast, Doctor.
There's no use. I'll have to operate.
That was lovely...
Frederic, darling.
You mustn't worry, darling.
I'm not going to die now.
I got past the place where I was going to die.
Aren't you glad?
Of course you are not going to die.
You mustn't think about it.
- It's a caesarean.
- We're lucky to be on time.
Is she going to be all right?
- Are you the husband? - Yes.
She kept calling for you all night.
It would have been better if you'd been here.
Is she in danger?
- She's very weak. - You don't suppose I could see her now?
- Later, later.
- It won't be long.
She can't die.
Did you call?
No, I didn't say anything.
Not yet.
The baby?
A boy, but he was dead before she ever came in here.
But she'll be all right?
That's not in my hands any longer.
Better go across the street and get yourself some breakfast.
You look as if you need it.
It will be some time before she can see you.
There's nothing there, dog.
You've had children? What was it like?
I beg your pardon?
Some coffee, please, and a brioche.
It's in the papers. Italy has won!
Thank God it's over.
This is the beginning of the end.
But it will be a long time before they can rebuild what's been destroyed.
"In the early morning hours of November 4th,
"the Austro-Hungarian supreme command accepted by radiogram
"the armistice conditions laid down by the General Badoglio."
Don't let her die.
Oh, God, please don't let her die.
I'll do anything for you if you don't let her die.
You took the baby... That was all right.
But don't let her die. Please.
Her husband's out there.
Might as well let him in.
I knew he was coming.
When I went under, I knew he was here.
You won't tell him, will you?
Tell him what?
That I'm going to die.
- No, we won't tell him.
Doctor... Have I long?
Don't you see?
I have to know.
Not long.
Let him come in.
Could I... Could I have my bag, first?
Such a mess.
He never liked me to be pale.
- You're all right?
Did you worry about me?
I came as soon as I found where you were.
Poor darling.
Tut-tut. You're wet and tired.
Sit down, darling.
You're going to be all right, Catherine.
Do you want me to do anything, Cat?
- Can I get you anything?
Just talk to me.
Tell me you haven't stopped loving me.
You know I couldn't stop.
I like to hear you say it, though.
I'll never stop loving you.
Never?
Not even if I died?
Never.
You'd never do our things with any other girl, or say the same things, would you?
I want you to have other girls, though.
That's right, dear.
Try to sleep, Cat.
When I get well, we'll... We'll take a little house in the mountains.
We always planned a house of our own, remember?
I'll get you a fine house.
We'll live in it until the war is over.
Then you'll go back to America and be a splendid architect.
We'll be married all over again.
In a church.
Oh, darling!
I don't wanna die.
- Don't let me die.
Take me in your arms, hold me tight.
- Don't let me go. - Catherine.
It's dark out there, and lonely.
I don't wanna leave you any more.
I've been alone so much.
You can't die. You're too brave to die.
You're a fine girl. A brave girl.
I am a brave girl.
Whatever happens, do not be afraid.
I'll not be afraid.
We've never been apart. Really. Not since we met.
Not since we met.
And never can be.
- Never parted.
- In life and in death.
Say it, Cat.
In life and in death, we'll never be parted.
You do believe that, don't you, Cat?
I believe it.
And I'm not afraid.
Peace...
We didn't lie to you, folks.
We told you we had living, breathing monstrosities.
You laughed at them, shuddered at them... and yet, but for the accident of birth... you might be even as they are.
They did not ask to be brought into the world... but into the world they came.
Their code is a law unto themselves.
Offend one... and you offend them all.
And now, folks, if you'll just step this way... you are about to witness the most amazing... the most astounding living monstrosity... of all time.
Friends... she was once a beautiful woman.
A royal prince shot himself for love of her.
She was known as the peacock of the air.
She's the most beautiful big woman I have ever seen.
Why, Hans, how you talk.
I should be jealous pretty soon.
- Don't be silly.
I've seen these women making eyes at my Hans.
Of course, I ain't jealous.
Frieda, my dear...
I have eyes for only one woman... the woman I asked to be my wife.
- Why, no, monsieur.
- Thanks. I'm glad.
- Why should I laugh at you?
- Most big people do.
They don't realize I'm a man with the same feelings they have.
You are so kind, monsieur.
- Nice.
You must come to see me sometime, and we'll have a little wine together.
Thank you, Fräulein Cleo.
Probably, last night you had too heavy a dinner, and now your imagination is...
But, Monsieur Duval, at first I could not believe my own eyes.
A lot of horrible, twisted things, you know, crawling, whining, laughing...
Be done, Jean. What were you drinking last night?
Nothing, monsieur, I assure you.
Monsieur, there must be a law in France to smother such things at birth...
- or lock them up.
If there's anything like you say on my grounds, we'll have it removed.
Go away, all of you!
Don't you know trespassing is the same as stealing?
I'm sorry, monsieur.
I am Madame Tetrallini.
These children are in my circus.
Children? They're monsters.
Your circus.
So you see, monsieur, when I get a chance... I like to take them into the sunshine... and let them play like... children.
That is what most of them are.
Children.
Please forget what was said, madame.
You are welcome to remain.
Thanks a thousand, monsieur.
Shame!
How many times have I told you not to be frightened?
Have I not told you... God looks after all his children?
- Good evening, Madame Tetrallini.
Big crowd tonight.
There she goes, taking them out to exercise.
Nurse to a lot of mangy freaks.
"Just as they are represented on the banners...
"you will see them on the inside.
"Living, breathing monstrosities.
"Josephine Joseph, half-woman, half-man."
Have a cigar, Joseph.
You dropped your lipstick, Josephine.
Don't get her sore, or he'll bust you in the nose.
That's a boy.
You're all wrong. I didn't do it.
What are you trying to do, be funny?
You just don't understand.
A Roman lady... Getting off the bull and scratching yourself.
Can't a Roman lady itch?
- Why don't you take a bath?
- I did, but it's the bull that needs the bath.
I think she likes you... but he don't.
Those flowers you sent to me, they were beautiful.
But not much beautiful as you.
And Hans, I don't like to ask... but may I have the loan of another 1,000 francs... until my money from Paris arrives?
- With pleasure, Fräulein.
I'll bring it to your wagon tonight.
Forget it.
- Maybe I was just fooling.
- Fooling?
"Come, little girl, I want to take care of you."
And I fell for that.
Forget it.
So, you're quitting. Is that it?
Maybe I'm only fooling.
You are not quitting me! Because I'm kicking you out!
No, you don't.
I gave you this.
Why, you cheap...
Don't you come around crying tonight, trying to get back in.
I'm through wasting my time and money... on things like you.
Yes. Your time, but my money.
Ungrateful little tramp.
What are you staring at?
Didn't you ever see a lady move before?
I guess you've been listening to every word he said.
Go ahead and laugh.
It's funny, ain't it?
Yeah. Women are funny, ain't they?
They're all tramps, ain't they?
Yeah. Except when you can get money from them.
Who do you think you are, shooting off your head?
This is Phroso you're talking to.
Not any of those thugs you've been chasing around with. - Now, you listen to me.
- I didn't mean you.
- I had to take it out on somebody.
- Yeah, you dames are all alike.
You're sharpshooting, you're cheap... and how you squeal when you get what's coming to you.
Easy, kid.
Cut it!
It's my own fault.
What gets me so cockeyed sore at myself... is that I fell for that big hunk of beef.
So you finally got wise to yourself, did you?
The funny thing about you women is most of you don't get wise soon enough.
You wait until you're so old, nobody wants you.
Nobody does, most of the time.
You ought to be tickled to death you're washed-up with him.
You're not so hard to look at.
Give yourself a tumble. You'll make the grade.
- Your breaks is coming.
- Coming? Gone, you mean.
Now you'll sit there feeling sorry for yourself.
No, I ain't.
Don't you ever accuse me of that.
But one thing, don't go out filling your hide with booze, celebrating... 'cause fun what's got that way never done no one no good.
Get me?
I got you.
You're a pretty good kid.
You're darn right I am.
You should have caught me before my operation.
- Well, well, well. - Tomorrow night's the big night, Daisy?
- Yes, the sister's getting married.
- And I'm thrilled to death.
- She thrills at anything.
- Roscoe's a good kid.
- She's only joking.
She'll like him lots after she knows him better.
That reminds me. Close your eyes, Violet. Go ahead, close them.
- What did I do?
- Pinched Daisy's arm.
What do you know about that?
Her master's voice is calling.
Getting fresh?
I don't like it one...
Come on, you'll have to hurry.
We haven't much time.
So you were flirting with that cheap clown, were you?
- No, I wasn't.
- He was doing a trick with me.
You shut up.
I'm marrying your sister, not you.
- I saw him getting familiar with you.
- Come on, Daisy. No, you don't.
She's going to stay right here.
No, she isn't.
I got to go.
You're always using that for an... For an alibi.
You don't look at others so much, do you?
Yes, I have seen you.
So that's how it is.
You got to be caught.
Help yourself to a drink.
That is fine.
Feel like eating something?
I'm not very hungry. About six.
How do you like them?
But you are strong.
You are squeezing me to death.
And you'll like it.
You are taking my breath away.
You...
Now, here's something for your eye.
But, Hans, my Liebchen, you have not been listening... to a word I have been saying.
- You have not been listening to me.
- Yes, I have, Frieda.
Then what was I saying?
You were saying...
I was saying, tonight you must not smoke such a big cigar.
Your voice was very bad at tonight's show.
Please, Frieda, don't tell me what I do.
When I want a cigar, I smoke a cigar.
I want no orders from a woman.
This is the first time since we have been engaged... you have spoken to me so.
Why is it?
Friedchen, I'm sorry. I...
- Here's our coffee.
- Five lumps of sugar in each.
The little ape sent to Paris for this?
Yes, Paris. We're doing very well.
But I don't like fruit.
You should eat a lot. It's good for you.
Next time, I tell him I like champagne.
- It's Hans.
My darling, your basket of fruit was lovely.
But I am... taking a bath now.
- Can't you come back later?
You'll spoil everything if he hears you.
What's the matter? You ain't singing as usual.
This morning I have such a big washing to do.
How's Hans?
I said, how's Hans?
Hans is fine. Danke, he's fine.
Frieda, something's wrong. What is it?
That Cleopatra woman... My Hans...
- I cannot tell it.
- She's still after Hans, ain't she?
Yeah. Always she's smiling by him.
Well, if she smiles by somebody I know... she'll have to buy herself a new set of teeth.
Why is it we women always has got to worry?
It's always been that way. I guess it always will be.
Yeah. And, by me, she has no shame.
Always, when I can hear it, she says to him:
"Many thanks, my darling, for the flowers.
"Thanks, my darling," for this... and "Thanks, my darling," for that.
Always something he has given her.
Don't you worry, Frieda. He doesn't love her.
That big horse.
Yes, but she keeps after him.
That's why I worry.
Why not pink tights? You know. With spangles all around.
It will show her figure off more.
Nein. No tights.
Without tights.
You know, that soft, flimsy, what-you-call-it stuff.
Where the figure shows through.
Why not like Lady Godiva?
Ja, that's it.
And I'll hire her to ride the back of my bull.
Dummkopf! What have you on your shoulder for heads?
Swiss cheese?
- What's the matter, Cleo?
- I think I strained my shoulder last night.
Give a rub, will you?
Farther.
Down. Over.
It's so good to be rubbed.
- Our cards, lady.
A couple of rubbers from Berlin.
That reminds me.
I had a swell dream about you last night.
You were standing in a bathing suit on a rock.
You know, like a statue.
The wind was blowing through your hair, the waves were washing around you.
And your figure. How it stood out.
It looked great.
Say, you have got a good figure.
Do you think so?
Did you try that gag I told you about?
Yeah, I did, and it was a wow. Get up here, Johnny.
I'll show it to you.
I did what you told me, and it laid them right in the sawdust.
Watch this, Venus.
Phroso, what else did you dream?
Then the dream changed. We was in Paris.
- Yeah, at the opera, right in the front box.
- We were all dressed up.
- What did I have on?
And did I look swell. Everybody was pointing at me. They were saying, "That's Phroso, the clown."
And was I embarrassed.
- Did they say anything about me?
- What did they say?
- Hit me.
Go ahead. Hit me.
On the head.
Hit me.
That's how it is.
You don't think it's funny.
It's sad, is it? It will just panic them, that's how sad it is.
Come on, Venus. The bearded lady's baby's born!
- Ain't it cute? What is it?
- A girl.
Oh, boy, that's great. And it's going to have a beard.
- How's the proud father?
- Fine. - What was it?
Better luck next time. You may get a couple of Smith Brothers.
Please, Violet, don't quarrel with him anymore.
If he's going to say anything, let him say it.
Don't let him "p-p-p" for an hour.
You're going to do as I say.
I'm the boss of my home.
- Half of it, you mean.
- Please, Violet.
Listen here. I don't want those tramps you go with... hanging around my wife.
Be quiet. Hook up our dress.
If it isn't your dress I'm hooking up, it's something else.
And another thing. You got to cut out getting drunk every night, too.
- Is that so?
I'm not going to have my wife laying in bed half the day with your hangover.
Daisy, let's get out of here.
No, she don't.
She's going to stay right here.
Come on. I got to go.
You're always using that for an... For an alibi.
Cleopatra ain't one of us.
Why, we're just filthy things to her.
She'd spit on Hans if he wasn't giving her presents.
Let her try it. Let her try doing anything to one of us.
She don't know us, but she'll find out.
I peeked out of the corner of my eye... and caught Madame Tetrallini giving us the once-over.
I guess she knows she's got a good act.
One of the best in the business.
It isn't only our act that gets them.
We've got personality. We know how to sell the stuff.
Same way in the last town.
Never heard such applause in your life.
Let me tell you something that everybody around here don't know. We're only killing time with this circus.
We've got bigger time to follow, and we can do it, too.
Catch our act tomorrow night. We got something new.
Yeah? Can you do anything with your eyebrow?
Schlitze, what a pretty dress.
How beautiful you look tonight.
You're just a man's woman.
You know what I mean? You.
If you're a good girl, when I get to Paris I'll buy you a big hat... with a long, beautiful feather on it.
Hasn't Schlitze got a beautiful dress? Isn't that pretty?
When I get to Paris, I'm going to buy her a big hat with a long feather on it.
And if you're good girls, I'll buy you a hat with a bigger feather on it.
Why, Schlitze, what's the matter?
I'm sorry, Schlitze.
He was out there again tonight.
He followed you from the last town.
I know it, and if Eddie sees it, there'll be a fight.
- It ain't your fault.
- There you are, Frances.
- Thought you'd gone to bed.
Hear that crowd out there again tonight?
I bet you thought the tent was on fire.
Well, it wasn't.
Just the Rollo Brothers panicking them again.
But then, we do it in every town.
We're so used to it, it's getting monotonous.
You want to take a look at our act tomorrow night.
Don't waste any of it.
- Look how it sparkles.
- Like your eyes.
Dancing, gay, like bubbles.
Nice.
It comes by the finest vineyards of France.
And you sent for it especially for me?
For the most beautiful woman in all the world.
Hello there, baby.
Where have you been so long?
You're a funny guy, Phroso.
- Sometimes, you panic me.
- Don't I know it?
I panic the world because I use my noodle.
I think up funny gags. I make the world laugh.
With me, clowning is an art.
Why the hat?
The head cold?
- Thought you and me had a date to go out.
- I forgot all about it.
Well, I'm into this now. I've got to go through with it.
Make it snappy, will you?
I'm all dolled up for the occasion.
Sorry, kid. Can't do it now.
We'll make it some other time.
Don't feel that way about it.
I just got this idea all of a sudden.
I've got to finish it.
- Funny gag, isn't it?
- Yeah, I'm laughing myself sick.
That's much better.
That's the first time you've ever done that.
- Ain't the first time I felt like doing it.
I don't mind telling you I've wanted to do this for a long time.
- We're all set now, Venus?
- All set now. - Yeah.
Please do.
Don't you want to make me happy?
- Yes, but I don't know what to say.
- Just say yes, dear.
Will you?
What are your kicking about? You've got a good wife.
You're happy.
It's that sister-in-law of mine.
She wants to sit up half the night, reading.
- That's tough. - Tough?
Cleo's gone on a diet.
- It's awfully sweet of you to say that.
- And I know Violet will be happy.
Here's Roscoe.
- Roscoe, this is Mr. Rogers.
Glad to meet you.
- Violet and he are engaged to be married.
Yes, and you must come to see us sometime.
You must come to visit... Come to see us sometime, too.
I certainly will. Thanks.
It's Frieda, Hans.
Now that I'm here, I don't know how to say it... how to make you understand.
If you knew how I feel, Hans... to come to you about her.
Frieda, I'm so sorry.
I don't want to hurt you, but ich kann es nicht helfen.
If you could be happy, Hans... I would not care.
But I am happy, Frieda.
Never in my life was I so happy.
No, Hans. You think it only.
For you, she cannot bring happiness.
Frieda, you don't know.
But I do, Hans.
You think because she's so beautiful and I'm just...
Don't, Hans. Please.
To me, you're a man.
But to her, you're only something to laugh at.
The whole circus. They make fun by you and her.
Let them laugh. The swine.
I love her. They can't hurt me.
But they hurt me.
Frieda, I have been a coward.
I should have come to you in the beginning.
Yes, Hans, I forgive you.
It is only that you should be happy I want.
You won't worry now, will you?
No, I won't worry.
Nice. Very nice.
It's platinum.
Say, where do you think that little polliwog is getting his money?
Listen at him.
Getting so particular.
What do you care where the money comes from?
How much it's worth?
We got $500 for the bracelet, but this looks like thousands.
I think next time I'll take a fur coat.
Say, that little ape's got ideas about you.
I'd squish him like a bug.
That's his knock.
I'll get rid of him. Go quickly.
It's about Hans.
Well? I'm listening.
It's behind his back.
Everybody's laughing because he's in love with you.
I know you just make fun... but Hans, he does not know this.
If he finds out... never again will he be happy.
What makes you think that I am just making fun?
You're big. So beautiful...
And Hans is so little... so cute.
Well, maybe I'm going to marry him.
If you marry, it will be at you they laugh and stare.
That's good. Nothing like being different.
Cleopatra... queen of the air, married to a dwarp.
- A dwarf.
- A dwarp!
Then it's not for Hans you care.
- It's the money.
- Money?
You little mind reader.
He has told you of the fortune he has inherited.
Always he swear to me... to tell no one until after we leave the circus.
A fortune?
And fancy you knowing about it, too.
Well, I can't be angry at him for that.
No. You cannot do this.
You wait and see.
Please. You can't.
A fortune.
I bet the little ape's worth billions!
A fortune. Can you beat that?
A fortune. And I have him like that.
Shrewd little Hans. He knew enough to keep his mouth shut.
I could marry him.
Yes, he would marry me.
Midgets are not strong.
He could get sick.
It could be done.
Done. I know it.
Come on, my little precious. Come on, let's drink.
Big, happy drink. Come on.
Please be quiet. Hey, Koo Koo, give somebody else a chance.
All right, professor.
A waltz, please.
Show him up, volcano.
Burn him up.
Our wedding night.
What a thrill.
Never before did I think I should be so lucky.
I am the lucky one.
My little Hans.
My Cleo's happy.
I am so happy. I even could kiss you, you big, homely brute.
My little green-eyed monster.
My husband is jealous.
Come, my little lover.
Drink to the happiness of your loving wife.
We'll make her one of us.
A loving cup.
We accept her, one of us
We accept her
One of us
They're going to make you one of them. My, big luck.
We accept her!
One of us!
They're going to make you one of them, my dear.
You dirty... slimy freaks!
Get out of here!
Get out!
You heard her! Get out!
You filth!
Make me one of you, will you?
Well, what are you going to do?
What are you, a man or a baby?
Please. You make me ashamed.
Ashamed. You?
Holy jumping Christmas!
What must I do?
Must I play games with you?
Must mama take you horsy-back ride?
That's it. Horsy-back ride.
Come, my little flyspeck.
Mama is going to take you horsy-back ride.
- Giddyap.
Forget it, Hans.
She is sorry. I'm sorry.
Didn't I told you she was drunk?
Didn't I told you we was only having a little fun?
- No, you don't.
I tell you, there's nothing between me and Cleo.
Be quiet.
Haven't you done enough damage for one night?
Don't you realize what I'm being accused of?
I ain't going to be blamed for something I have not done.
I don't blame you, Cleo.
I don't blame Hercules.
Only me. Myself.
Now you're talking.
- Talking like a man.
- You fool.
Always I should have known... you would only laugh at me.
My sweet, I'd rather fall from the trapeze and break my neck... than hurt your feelings.
Do you understand now?
It was only joke.
Our wedding... a joke?
Now I know how funny it is.
Hans the midget.
Hans... the fool!
Tell the divorce court. They'll laugh.
Everywhere, they're laughing.
- You give him too much.
I know what I am doing.
Come on, pick him up.
Doctor, what is it?
What caused it?
Poison.
A very bad case of ptomaine poisoning.
Doctor, did I do wrong, then? Giving him mustard water?
No. Probably saved his life.
Never before did he drink like that... but she kept making him, and making him.
Drink?
You better get Cleo to tell the doctor what she put in that wine last night.
- What you're talking about?
- The stuff she put in the wine.
You're crazy.
You can't get away with it. I'll tell the coppers.
So, tell on your own people?
My people are decent circus folks. Not dirty rats what would kill a freak to get his money.
You dirty little...
Your imagination's getting the best of you.
Yeah, maybe it is.
But coppers don't have imaginations, so I've been told.
Don't make me have to go to them.
It has been a week tonight... since we have been married.
A week, since I have said...
- all those things to you.
- Don't!
Never can I forgive myself for what I've said.
I've forgotten it.
Nothing matters except for you to be well.
So good you are by me, Cleo.
I must fix your medicine, or I'll be late.
I'll be soon back, my little.
Don't be lonely.
I'll never forget what you are doing for me, Cleo.
But it's what I want to do, my darling.
Now I must hurry.
Will you leave the door open, please?
Yes, my darling.
- Tonight.
- They will be ready.
All right. You come to my wagon.
"I must hurry now and fix your medicine, my darling...
"or I will be late."
"Dirty...
"slimy freaks."
- He's waiting.
Soon we go.
- You're imagining things.
Then I hear Hercules tell Cleo:
"Venus knows too much."
- Hercules?
Venus?
My little, you must go to sleep.
Your friends better go now.
- I like them here.
- No, Hans.
They can come back tomorrow.
I will give you your medicine and get you off to sleep.
Go on, all of you.
Quick.
- What's this?
- Give me that little black bottle.
Bottle.
You got this bottle of poison... to kill.
Get out, Venus!
Do I have to bust you in the jaw to make you get out?
Get out, Venus!
How she got that way will never be known.
Some say a jealous lover.
Others... that it was the code of the freaks.
Others, the storm.
Believe it or not, there she is.
But, sir, they insist on seeing you.
In all these years, I've seen no one.
Have I not told you that?
- Send them away.
- I can't see no one. - Excuse me, sir.
I have my orders.
- Who's going to stop me?
I'm in, ain't I?
Yes, you can, Hansie, old boy.
There's someone you've just got to see.
Why did you come here?
Please, Hans. Don't be angry.
Venus and Phroso have been so kind by me.
Please go away.
I can see no one.
But, Hans, you tried to stop them.
It was only the poison you wanted.
Don't cry, Hans.
Come to me, my Liebchen.
Don't cry.
Don't, Hans.
Is that the clinic?
This is Senf, the head porter, Grand Hotel.
How's my wife? Is she in pain?
Isn't the child coming soon?
Patience?
Would you have patience?
This is Otto Kringelein.
Is that you, Heinrich?
I've got to talk very quickly.
Every minute costs 2 marks 90.
You know that will I made before I had my operation?
I want you to tear it up.
I came to Berlin to see a great specialist about that old trouble of mine, you know?
It's pretty bad, and he says I haven't long to live.
No, it isn't nice to be told things like that.
You plague, bother, and save, and all of a sudden you're dead.
I want to get something out of life.
I'm never going back to Friedersdorf. Never.
I'm staying here at the Grand Hotel.
It's the most expensive hotel in Berlin.
All the best people stay here.
Even our big boss, Preysing, is staying here.
I'm going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him.
This is General Director Preysing.
I want my home in Friedersdorf, please.
Hello. Is that you, Mama?
How are the children?
What news have you from the factory, dear?
Is your papa there? Good.
Hello, Papa, is that you?
The conference with the Saxonia company is set for tomorrow morning, Papa.
If the merger does not go through, we are in very bad shape, Papa.
Everything depends upon news from Manchester.
If the deal with the Manchester Cotton Company does not go through... we're facing a very bad situation, Papa.
I'm Suzette, Mme. Grusinskaya's maid. Madame will not dance today.
She will not go to the rehearsal. She did not sleep all night.
There is something preying on her mind.
I gave her a tablet, a Veronal. She's sleeping now.
This is Baron von Geigern.
Look here, I need money, or I can't stay at this hotel much longer.
I've laid the groundwork. I know the exact position of her room. I've made friends with her ballet master, Pimenov.
Listen, Heinrich. I've taken all my savings, everything... and I'm going to enjoy spending it. All of it.
It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
But it's wonderful.
I can't! I'll lose my job.
It's like being in jail.
Rely on me, Papa.
I will make this merger go through.
I never fail. Poor Madame.
Her mind is tortured. I'm afraid she will....
I don't need advice, thanks very much. I need money!
Music all the time. It's wonderful.
People coming, going.
Nothing ever happens.
Mme. Grusinskaya will not want her car. Mme. Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
- Yes, Baron? - Adolphus is very vexed with you.
- Yes, Baron? You didn't take him for his walk this morning.
- Your door was locked.
- You might have knocked.
Don't you realize? That's why they don't like little dogs in big hotels. The doors are locked.
You see?
- Yes, Baron. - I want you to take him for a good walk.
- Yes, Baron. - Don't bring him back till he's exhausted. - No, Baron.
- Is that for me? No. Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. Good evening. Will you send this to Mme. Grusinskaya?
- Thanks very much. Good evening.
My key, 168.
- Good evening, Baron. - How is the beautiful lady?
- Grusinskaya?
To tell the truth, Baron, tonight we're a little bit nervous.
Were you at the theater last night?
I'm always there when Grusinskaya dances.
- Last night was not so good.
- I thought she was splendid.
Is Mr. Preysing in?
I'm Dr. Zinnowitz.
- Sorry to have kept you waiting. Waiting? I've been waiting for news from Manchester.
- No news yet?
- No news.
That's bad.
You can't hold out unless you merge with the Saxonia company.
- I know.
- The Saxonia company will never sign... unless your firm is tied up with the Manchester people. They don't have to. I told you that.
Yes, I know. I'm very much worried. But I have my agent in Manchester.
I'm expecting a telegram any minute.
You have to create a good impression. Seem optimistic.
Don't even mention Manchester to the Saxonia crowd. Be clever.
No, I cannot do that, Dr. Zinnowitz.
I'm used to making my deals on a solid basis.
I'm an honest businessman, a good husband and a father.
I have nothing to conceal.
I could not live happily otherwise.
Yes, I know. We'll go someplace and talk it over.
I'm expecting a stenographer.
Send her to Mr. Preysing's room. 166.
- Letters for me?
- No, Doctor. - Telegrams?
He always seems to be waiting for something... but it never happens.
- No messages?
Yes, I was in the war.
- Your bill, Baron.
- You're not beginning that again, are you?
Please pay some attention to me.
- Has anyone asked for me?
- No, Doctor. We're holding the rooms now. Five bedrooms, two sitting rooms.
- How many in your party? - Let me see. My mother, two sisters...
- Really, this is an imposition.
- Sir, kindly wait one moment, please.
Really, I won't wait any longer. I've been here a very long time.
That's all right. Look here, I waited three days before I got a room at all. When I finally got one, what kind of a room was it?
- A very nice room, and inexpensive.
- If you wait one moment, sir...
- I can't wait.
Every day is precious. Every hour... - 176?
- ...every minute is precious.
I came to live here for two weeks, maybe three. Heaven only knows.
I can pay whatever you want.
I'm tired and ill. I can't wait.
- The gentleman has a complaint?
- He is dissatisfied with Room 559.
Yes, I have a complaint. I think it's a perfectly fair complaint.
I came here from a great distance to live at the Grand Hotel.
I want a room, a big room.
The same kind of room you'd give General Director Preysing.
I'm as good as Mr. Preysing.
I can pay for a room the same as Mr. Preysing.
Would you stick him way off in a corner in a little room... where the water pipes go "pop" all day?
He can have my room. It doesn't matter where I stay.
That won't be necessary, Doctor.
Mr. Kringelein will take Room 176.
It's one of our most expensive rooms.
A large room on the front, and with a bar.
- With a private bar, exclusively mine. - Certainly, sir.
Exactly what I want.
That's very kind. I'll pay for it now.
- No, I beg of you, sir. - Pardon me, sir.
You dropped your little hat.
- Permit me. - Thank you.
Permit me.
My name is Kringelein, from Friedersdorf.
Permit me to present Dr. Otternschlag.
A doctor.
Doctor, I'm ill.
I know. When a man's collar is an inch too big for him, I know he's ill.
I must go and dress now. - I hope to see you at the theater. - Surely, sir.
- Is this gentleman a baron, too?
- Unfortunately, no. - Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here?
- I have signed once.
- Have you a minute?
- I told you not to come into the lobby.
Time's getting short.
Haven't I told you not talk to me with a cigarette in your mouth?
- I want to speak...
Mr. Preysing. - Will you go up to 166? - 166.
Baron, you're incorrigible.
Poor Grusinskaya.
- How can she receive anyone? She can't. - No, of course not.
Theater, hotels, trains. Trains, hotels, theater.
- I must toddle along. - She'll be waking up and calling for me.
Who are you, please?
I'm the stenographer.
Then you will please wait outside, please.
Outside, please.
Take your time.
Listen, the burial fund and everything.
I've got it right here.
I'm going to live. I'm going to have a good time while I can.
That's my creed, Kringelein:
a short life and a gay one.
A short life, Baron, and a gay one.
That's very true in my case.
You know, I know you won't think I'm impertinent... but perhaps you might have a little better time... if you bought some new clothes. Started out fresh, so to speak.
Well, Baron, I didn't think there was time for that.
But it's very kind of you to take an interest.
- Friends, then. - Friends, Baron?
Thank you. - Your room is ready, sir. - Thank you.
I may speak to the Baron anytime I see him?
Of course, Kringelein. Why not?
I mean, when you're with your smart friends?
- I haven't any friends, Kringelein.
- You said me, Baron.
- Friend.
- Bless you, Kringelein.
See you later.
I've often wondered what would happen to that porter... if somebody jumped on him from here.
I'm sure I don't know.
Why don't you try it and find out?
- Thanks very much.
- Don't you like dancing?
- No. Not with strangers.
- Never? - Never.
- Are you back again?
He must be an awful nice fellow.
- Who? - Whoever's keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
- Seen what?
- It.
You don't mean 166?
That fat, bulbous neighbor of mine, Mister....
- Preysing.
- Not you.
Work.
- Does he sing?
- Weren't you playing something?
- Yes. The typewriter.
- You're a little stenographess.
- Yes, I'm a little stenographess.
That's fascinating.
I don't suppose you'd take some dictation from me sometime, would you?
- How about some tea, then?
- Tea would spoil my dinner.
I only have one meal a day, and I'd rather hate to spoil it.
- Are you reducing?
- Reducing?
Me? Do I need to?
No. It's perfect.
I don't think I've ever.... But why one meal a day?
- Money.
Ever heard of it? - Yes, I have, vaguely.
But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies.
- Very little. - That's too bad.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on?
I have, indeed.
One she'd bought herself?
I see what you mean. Poor kid.
- I wish I were free tonight.
- Aren't you?
No, darn it, I'm not.
But there's tomorrow.
- What time tomorrow?
- 5:00, downstairs.
Where downstairs?
In the funny yellow room where they dance.
You're funny.
- Tomorrow?
Really?
We'll dance?
I wonder if I could remind the Baron of his promise... that I might speak to him at any time?
Mr. Kringelein, how are you making out in the royal suite?
- Wonderfully, thanks to the Baron.
- Are you a baron?
- Strangely enough, yes.
- Then this isn't the Baroness?
- Do I look like a baroness?
- You're attractive enough to be anything.
- Thank you, Miss....
- Miss Flaemm.
- Miss Flaemm, this is Mr. Kringelein. - Hello.
- They call me Flaemmchen.
- I like that better.
I wonder if the Baron would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room?
I've ordered some caviar and champagne.
It's very expensive, but that doesn't matter.
Perhaps Miss Flaemm would join us.
Have caviar, if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
It does, as a matter of fact. I hadn't thought of that.
I'm sure my beautiful room... will appeal to your artistic sense. It has real velvet upholstery.
A-number one.
I'm in the textile trade, and I know.
I wonder if you'd like to see my bathroom?
It has hot and cold running water all day. Nighttime, too.
I can have a bath anytime that I like.
Stenographer. Please.
Her master's voice. Goodbye, Mr. Kringelein. Thank you.
Goodbye, funny one.
Don't forget tomorrow. 5:00.
- What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
- You know him, don't you?
- I know him?
I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years.
I know him through and through.
- Sorry, old man. - I beg your pardon, Baron.
Excuse me. Won't you join me in my room? I've ordered some champagne.
Listen, I'd love to. I'll join you a little later.
You know the gentleman we met downstairs, with the face?
- Who? The doctor, you mean?
- Yes.
- He's a gay old blade, isn't he?
- He's wonderful.
Please, Messieurs, Madame is asleep.
Has Madame slept well?
No, I've been awake, thinking.
It is time for the performance.
I think, Suzette... I've never been so tired in my life.
Not even the Veronal can help me to sleep.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
- I can't dance tonight.
- It will pass, Madame.
Pearls are cold.
Everything is cold and finished.
So far away. So threadbare.
The Russians.
Saint Petersburg.
Imperial court.
The Grand Duke Sergei....
Sergei... is dead.
It's all gone.
Mon Dieu. The pearls, if they were to break....
The pearls don't break.
They hold together and bring me bad luck.
I hate them.
Orchids again, Madame! No card. I think they are perhaps from the same young man.
He is at the end of the corridor. Tall. He walks like a soldier.
Madame must have noticed how often he rides in the elevator with us.
- Madame, the car is here.
- Send it away. I shan't need it.
Mme. Grusinskaya will not require her car.
No. She'll not be going to the theater.
- Time for the performance.
- The performance.
Poor little Lisebeta.
She still has her stage fright.
It will pass.
- It's not stage fright.
It's something more.
- What? What is it?
- Last night there was no applause.
That theater, half empty. Dancing for those few.
I was frantic.
I finished, I waited, I listened... but the applause did not come.
They're past, Pimenov. They're dead. It's finished.
Madame! In negligée an hour before the performance.
What's this, you're canceling your car? Do you know the time, or are we all mad?
Am I your manager? Have we contracts?
Have we obligations?
- Is this the time, or I am blind?
- I'm canceling the engagement.
Madame is canceling the engagement?
Madame has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke.
Tonight there is a line in front of the theater since 6:00.
The house is jammed to the roof.
- Is it really full?
- Doesn't Meierheim say so?
Packed to the ceiling.
And such an audience:
the French ambassador, American millionaires, Princess Retski...
- Hurry, Suzette. - We'll wait outside.
Poor child.
- How is the house?
- Terrible.
After this, no more ballets for me.
Jazz. Just jazz.
If the house is empty again.... I don't know.
When she gets her paint on, hears the music, she'll be fine. I know these people. Here she is.
Why did you bring the pearls?
I said I won't wear them.
- Why not? - Take them back.
- Hurry up. - We haven't time.
I don't think I'll be able to join you fellows after all.
Can I help?
You go ahead, old man. I'll be there if I'm up for it.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car.
- Is he in?
- The Baron?
Adolphus, I have something very serious to discuss with you.
When you meet lady dogs on the street that are not dachshunds... you must exercise some self-control.
We have company.
The dancer's gone to the theater.
Excuse me, I'm busy.
This is a very peculiar thing for one gentleman to say to another... but as a matter of fact... you're the one thing in the world I really love.
She's gone to the theater. Don't you know?
- What are you going to do? - The pearls are in her room.
The others are getting suspicious.
I had Amsterdam on the phone. They think you're scared.
I've been careful. I'm waiting my chance.
Waiting your chance? You're too much of a gentleman, that's the trouble.
I told you I'd get those pearls tonight, didn't I?
- Need any help? - No.
Have you got the skeleton key?
One reason: there's a perfectly charming floor clerk outside who sees everything. She'd see me enter her room.
- I can take care of her. - How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief while you're on the job.
- No. - Why not?
Poor kid. In the first place, it would give her a rotten headache.
I know all about chloroform. I had it in the war.
Besides, she's rather pretty.
- She has a very nice line... - You're no good for this business.
- No? - To you it's just a joke.
I don't like your tone.
Get out. Leave her to me.
Be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam.
- With the pearls.
There is a nasty man, Adolphus.
He'd eat his young.
"Both parties have fully agreed that this merger can only result... "in mutual advantages.
"Moreover...."
- Did you get that?
What did you say Zinnowitz called you?
Flaemmchen. - Flaemm? That's odd.
I mean, who were the gentlemen you were talking to in the corridor?
Some people I know.
- You know a lot of gentlemen, don't you? - Oh, not many.
I haven't time.
I'm busy now looking for a job.
I'd love to be in the movies.
Why the movies particularly? I mean....
"...only in mutual advantages. Moreover...."
You're a very unusual stenographer.
You're pretty enough to do other things.
- I do. - What?
You see, I have a rather nice figure, and I pose a lot.
Art studies, you know?
Like that? I got 10 marks for it.
Is that you? You?
Well, isn't that interesting?
- That's lovely.
- "Moreover...."
"Moreover, the possibility of the successful accommodation...
"for the Cotton Company...
"should throw a great weight into the balance...."
"Balance."
Your hands are sunburned, aren't they?
- Yes, that's from skiing. - From skiing?
A friend of mine took me to Switzerland last month.
To Switzerland?
That must have been very nice.
I went to Florence once, too.
- With the same man?
Don't misunderstand me, Miss Flaemm.
I'm a married man and have grown-up daughters...
Excuse me, please.
"Deal with Manchester definitely off." Is that something terrible?
It doesn't mean that at all.
- That's a mistake. That's wrong.
- All right. I'm sorry.
- Do you want to go on? - No.
You come back in the morning... and we will go on with the dictation before the conference.
After all, if I don't work tomorrow.... Well, good night.
"Deal definitely off."
Why, we could be smashed.
Hello? No. There's no one here.
What have you been doing?
Everyone says, "Come back." They won't get out of their rooms.
Housekeeper speaking. No, she isn't here.
- Western Theater? - Have you seen Madame?
Mr. Pimenov? Have you found her?
No, she isn't here. Yes, I know...
Pimenov? What's happening? No, I haven't found her.
Who's dancing? Duprez? How was it?
Good. All right. You keep the show going.
This trick is going to cost Madame a suit for breach of contract.
- Madame is ill. Her nerves...
- What about my nerves?
Who is she? Where does she think she is, Russia?
- I want to be alone.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna contract.
I just want to be alone.
You're going to be very much alone, my dear Madame. This is the end.
Western Theater, please.
Mr. Pimenov, the ballet master.
I'm at the hotel.
I couldn't go on. I couldn't.
How is it going?
Who's dancing?
Duprez?
Well, how is it?
They didn't miss me at all.
Good night, Pimenov.
They didn't even miss me.
Yes. I'm sorry. I've finished.
I always said I'd leave off when the time came.
And who would trouble about a Grusinskaya... who dances no more?
What would she do?
Grow orchids?
Keep white peacocks?
Die.
That's what it comes to at last: to die.
I'm not going to wait.
Don't be alarmed, Madame.
Someone who happened to be hiding in your room.
Why? I often come here when you're at the theater.
Why? Just to be alone in your room, to breathe the air you breathe.
There's no need to call for help. Permit me. I couldn't help hearing.
I couldn't help knowing what you were about to do just now.
I could have left by the window, unnoticed, but I risked being discovered.
May I say something, Madame?
You're so beautiful.
It tore my heart to see you in despair like that.
What on earth have they been doing to you?
You've everything to live for.
Please don't cry anymore.
You must forgive me.
I've had a very trying evening.
I was so alone, and suddenly you were there.
Why do you look at me like that?
I had no idea you were so beautiful.
I'd like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you, ever.
How tired you are.
Yes, tired.
And alone?
So alone.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man.
Am I so strange to you?
Maybe not so strange now.
You know, once, when the Grand Duke was alive... I found a man hiding in my room, a young officer.
Later on, they found him dead.
Well, that was Russia.
- Someone who can love you, that's all.
Someone who has forgotten everything else but you.
You could love me?
I've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are.
You must go now.
I'm not going. You know I'm not going.
Please let me stay.
But I want to be alone.
That isn't true. You don't want to be alone.
You were in despair just now. I can't leave you now.
You mustn't cry anymore.
You must forget.
Let me stay. Just for a little while.
Please let me stay.
For just a minute, then.
The champagne, and those girls and their dancing... those beautiful silver things, and the ice, and the caviar....
Oh, Doctor.
I don't care.
It's life. Life.
Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk.
- Good night. - No. My room.
Mr. Kringelein, you're drunk.
Life.
Grand Hotel.
Grand Hotel, good morning. Baron von Geigern's room does not answer.
Yes, all right. Baron von Geigern's chauffeur calling?
930, Dr. Otternschlag.
No, Doctor. No messages.
Grand Hotel, good morning. Who is calling Mme. Grusinskaya?
Mr. Pimenov. Mme. Grusinskaya cannot be disturbed.
Mr. Preysing's calls to 162 for the day.
- 162.
- The conference room.
That is interesting. A man in the textile industry must know Manchester.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company.
They have the whole English market right in their hands.
Have you any connections with Manchester?
We have a lot of good connections in England.
- Actually... - I mean, with the Manchester people.
Please, we are here to discuss the merger. Let us begin at the beginning.
- Thank you. Is Baron von Geigern in?
Too bad.
Since June 11 this year, when the first negotiation... I met him yesterday.
...between our respective firms... I've got a date.
...that this merger can result.... About 5:00.
- ...all of us. - Dancing.
- All we want to know about is Manchester. - Just a second.
Before I get through, I'm laying before you here... the last general statement of the concern.
The capital, the plant, the machinery....
For instance, we'll take mop rags.
- I'll call you back. - All we want to know about is Manchester.
Yes, Mr. Preysing, that's what we want to know.
I would rather wait for Justice Zinnowitz... before I commit myself, please.
Now, to go ahead with the merger. You realize... that this merger is a great advantage to the Saxonians, of course.
Now, let's talk like adults.
- When you first approached us...
- We did not approach you.
This letter filed on September 15 indicates you approached us.
That letter is a response to a tentative feeler sent out by you.
- Please.
- Tentative, my foot!
A month before this, your old father-in-law... - comes to me privately, and scratches... - Scratched?
- Why, we did not take the initiative! - You did...
- You took the initiative! Gentlemen, I see the conference has already begun.
- I'm glad you're here, Justice Zinnowitz. - Good morning.
- Thank you very much. - I beg your pardon, please.
Excuse me, please. I am glad you're here.
These gentlemen have cross words. Would you try, Justice Zinnowitz...
- and iron out the situation here? - Certainly.
Well, gentlemen, the situation seems to be perfectly clear.
- Yes. And how clear is Manchester? - Manchester?
Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Why, no, sir. I cannot commit myself at this time about Manchester.
Quite right.
Well, gentlemen, since June 11 of this year... when the first negotiations for a merger were entered...
Now we're going to begin at the beginning again.
As you remember it, when you approached us...
- We did not approach you.
- I'm sorry, you did approach us!
Can you imagine 100 girls in a ballet school... each thinking she would become the most famous dancer in the world?
I was ambitious then.
We were drilled like little soldiers.
No rest, no stopping.
I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.
Then I became famous soon.
But why am I telling you all this?
Last night I didn't know you at all.
- Who are you, really? - What?
I don't even know your name.
I am Felix Benvenuto Frihern von Geigern.
My mother called me Flix.
That's sweet.
And how do you live? What kind of person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock.
I shall die on the gallows.
I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
Really. You know, when I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman. Then at school, to pray and lie.
And then in the war, to kill and hide.
And what do you do now?
Now I'm a gambler... running at large, like a happy pig... devouring everything of life that pleases me.
I really belong in jail.
What a picture.
And what else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
That's not a funny joke.
You must believe one thing. You must believe that I love you. That I've never known love like this until now.
What is it, Flix? What's the matter?
Hotel thief.
Did you come here just for these?
That's horrible.
You may keep the pearls.
I don't want them.
I will not denounce you.
Hadn't you better go now?
I wanted money desperately. Can't you understand that? That's why I wanted your pearls.
I was threatened.
I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money.
I've been following you. I've admired you.
But last night, at last, I managed to come into your room.
And now....
I couldn't go through with it.
Don't you understand?
- Good morning, Madame. - Did Madame sleep well? - Yes, Suzette.
Come back in five minutes. I'll call you. Five minutes.
There, it begins.
Hello, Pimenov. Good morning.
Beautiful morning.
Yes, very well.
Rehearsals?
All right, you can come. Goodbye.
I have to go to rehearsals.
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning.
- Our train?
- Yes, for Vienna.
- You're coming with me.
- Of course you are. - But I can't.
I'd give my soul to go, but I can't.
- Why couldn't you?
- I'll try. There might be some way.
- Flix, is it money? - Of course.
I have money. I have enough for both of us.
No. That would spoil everything.
I'll manage somehow.
I'll get it.
I have a whole day. I'll be on the train.
I shall dance, and you'll be with me.
Then we'll go to Tremezzo. I have a villa there.
The sun will shine.
I'll take a vacation, six weeks, eight weeks.
I don't know. We'll be happy and lazy.
And then we'll go to South America.
It will be divine.
- Be careful going to your room.
- I'll be on the train with the money.
Don't do anything foolish.
- I'm alarmed about you.
- Don't worry. I'll be on the train.
Hurry, Suzette. A bright dress.
It's a sunny morning.
Meierheim is canceling the Vienna engagement.
Meierheim is mad.
You are mad. We're all mad.
Gru, you're positively radiant.
Pimenov, I have an idea, a ballet.
It must have mad music....
But I'll speak with you later.
You go to the theater.
I want a full rehearsal, ballet, full orchestra....
Will you get me Baron von Geigern, please?
Chéri, it's you.
No, nothing. Good morning.
Just to tell you that I'm happy.
I'll have something sweet and cold, please.
- Louisiana Flip, sir? - Louisiana Flip?
Yes, that sounds very nice. Thank you.
What do you do in the Grand Hotel?
Eat, sleep, loaf around... flirt a little, dance a little.
A hundred doors leading to one hall.
No one knows anything about the person next to them.
And when you leave, someone occupies your room... lies in your bed.
Let me say again, for the tenth time... you people were quite ready for the merger.
You declared yourself fully agreed on all the terms.
Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
I'll admit that we were at one time anxious for this merger.
But since then, the Preysing Company has fallen on evil days.
- Evil days? - Very evil days.
Say, listen. Haven't I just shown you here... what my firm exports to the Balkans? 50,000 marks worth of mop rags each and every year.
Mop rags.
We're interested in something entirely different.
- What? - Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time? It's getting late.
- You see...
- We're going home.
But Mr. Preysing has too great a regard for the certainty...
You've been talking all day. You're hoarse now.
Good night, Preysing. You have decided against the merger?
- Yes. - The deal is off?
Preysing, I hope you pull through.
It's a very bad time to be in such a crisis.
Sorry.
- Dining in town?
- No, I have to get my train.
Here! So you're breaking off the negotiations.
But don't you think for one moment that I'm such a fool... as not to have something to say about Manchester.
Manchester? No.
The deal is over. Good night, gentlemen.
If you have something definite to say about Manchester, we might...
I'm at liberty to announce at this time that the deal between my firm... and the Manchester Cotton Company... has been successfully negotiated.
Are you joking? Under those circumstances....
- Where are those articles?
- I thought it was all over.
Under these circumstances, it's a different matter.
Yes, but under these circumstances we might refuse to sign now.
Now, come, come. Business is business.
Now, I'll sign in here.
Preysing, you sign here.
We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine.
Good night. We'll see you next week and settle all the details.
Good night, Preysing. You're a sly one.
You let me talk myself hoarse... and you had Manchester signed up all the time.
- The deal has been put through. - Yeah.
The deal has been put through.
- What's the matter with you?
"Deal with Manchester definitely... "definitely off." Preysing!
Yes, if that's what the world wants, bluff...
I can be just as big a bluff as anyone.
You must go to England yourself at once and really see this through!
Yes, I must go to England. I was desperate.
I didn't know what I was doing. Now I don't care.
This thing goes to a man's head.
- What you need is some relaxation.
That's it! I want to break loose. I want to drink.
I want to maybe go dancing. I want to do anything.
I can understand that, after this....
Yes, go on, say it.
But that's the first time in 30 years that....
Where is my stenographer? Miss Flaemm?
- What do you want with her? - Pardon?
- What do you want?
- What?
Here.
I want to do some dictating.
I want to tell my father-in-law about...
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at 5:00.
Do you think that she's pretty?
- Pretty as a picture.
- You think so? Let's go find her. We'll go get a drink.
- Yes. I don't know much about women.
I've been married for 28 years, you know. Come along, Zinnowitz.
- Good evening, Miss Flaemm. - Have you seen the Baron?
- I'm waiting for him.
I've been with him all day. We had a marvelous time.
We were in a motor car, 100 miles an hour, in an airplane.
- Really? - We had a marvelous time.
My, how you've changed.
You look awfully nice.
Thank you, Miss Flaemm. I had a manicure, too.
I'm sorry, Miss Flaemm.
Would you have something to drink?
A Louisiana Flip. Louisiana Flip, please.
- Absinthe. - Oh, that.
- You like music, Mr. Kringelein?
- Yes. I love it.
It's so stimulating.
- A man could...
- A man could what?
- He could do almost anything. - He could.
- Hello, funny one. - Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Baron, won't you have a drink?
- Mr. Kringelein, how are you now?
I feel a little strange, Baron.
- I'd given you up. - Sorry.
Please, Baron, do have a drink. A Louisiana Flip.
No, thanks, old man. I'm keeping my head clear.
- Dance, then? - What?
- Yes, I'd love to.
- Watch this, will you, Mr. Kringelein?
- I really ought to learn to dance.
I suppose it's very important.
Yes, you should learn as quickly as the time allows.
Believe me, Mr. Kringelein, a man who is not with a woman... is a dead man.
- What have you been doing all day?
- Chasing around.
- Chasing what?
- Money.
- You were very different yesterday.
- That was yesterday.
I served as a surgeon in the Great War... till the end.
Grenade in my face.
I carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound till 1920.
Isolated two years.
- Drink, Mr. Kringelein. - Yes.
That was lovely.
Listen, funny one, do you want to make a man happy?
- I'd love to. - Dance with old Kringelein.
I don't know. He's a dear old duck.
I feel rather sorry for him, don't you?
You know, you're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Yesterday?
No, perhaps not.
I fell in love last night.
The real thing.
There's no real thing.
It just doesn't exist.
I thought that, too.
But now I know that it does.
It's wonderful.
Come along. - Dance with old Kringelein?
Here you are. I must speak with you.
- Presently, Mr. Preysing. - No, now. This is very urgent.
This lady has urgent business with me at the moment.
Insolence. Berlin manners.
Good evening, Mr. Preysing. You're staying here, too?
- I'm sorry, but I cannot place you.
- Kringelein, at the plant.
One of our agents.
No. Assistant bookkeeper, Room 23, Building C, third floor.
- I am away, sick.
- That's very interesting.
Would you like to dance with me, Mr. Kringelein?
Miss Flaemm, I've never danced in public.
- Come along and try it.
- I'd be afraid.
There's nothing to be afraid of. You'll love it.
Miss Flaemmchen, I must speak to you. This is about a dictating job.
- When do we start?
Tomorrow morning? - No, right now.
We were just going to dance.
Do you know each other?
Mr. Kringelein, Mr. Preysing.
Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
I couldn't think of not accepting the invitation to dance.
I understood you to say that you reported to our plant ill... and you're here in Berlin indulging in diversions... which are very much beyond your means?
This is very extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein.
I think we should look over your books.
Come along now, children. No fighting. Save that for the office.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Haven't I got any right to live?
I will wait 10 minutes for you. If you're not back, it will be necessary to engage someone else.
What happened to your dance?
We're going now, thank you, Baron. Come along.
I shall remember this, Mr. Kringelein.
Let the poor devil alone.
Death's staring him in the face.
I did not ask your advice.
I think you'd better go away.
We will see who will remain here the longer.
Mr. Kringelein, you must look at my face, and not the floor.
- Why, you're trembling.
- I never danced in public before.
- You dance beautifully. - Thank you.
- That's right. - I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Are you all right?
Yes. Excuse me, I just stopped a second.
I'm very tired. Do you mind if we stop?
- I must go back to Mr. Preysing now.
- Must you? Yes, business. One has to earn a living, you know.
Not you, Miss Flaemm.
Just another desk slave. Money.
- I'm glad you're here, Miss Flaemm. - Here I am.
- Did you enjoy your dance? - Yes, thank you.
- Excuse me. Go away, please.
- Where's the Louisiana Flip?
- Would you like a little cognac?
- Yes. You wanted to see me?
Yes. You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Mr. Preysing, I am not taking orders from you here.
What is this insolence? Please go away.
You think you have free license to be insulting?
Believe me, you have not.
- Go away, please. You are annoying.
- You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
When a man's working himself to death, that's what he's paid for. You don't care if a man can live on his wages or not.
You have a very regular scale of wages, and there's the sick fund for you.
What a scale, and what a fund.
When I was sick for four weeks... you wrote me a letter telling me I'd be discharged... if I were sick any longer.
Did you write me that letter or not?
I have no idea of the letters that I write.
I know that you are here in the Grand Hotel, living like a lord.
You are probably an embezzler.
- Yes, an embezzler. You are going to take that back!
Right here in the presence of this young lady!
Who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt?
If I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier... Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing!
- You're discharged.
- You can't do that to him.
I don't know the man or what he wants. I never saw him before.
I know you.
I've kept your books for you, and I know all about you.
If one of your employees was half as stupid in a small way... - as you are in a big way... - What do you mean?
- You're discharged!
Do you hear?
- Wait!
You can't discharge me.
I'm my own master... for the first time in my life.
I'm going to die.
You understand?
I'm going to die, and nobody can do anything to me anymore. Nothing can happen to me anymore.
Before I can be discharged, I'll be dead!
The man's crazy. I don't know him. He's annoying.
What's happened to him? - He's ill.
- I'm sorry, Baron.
- Poor old Kringelein. You're all right.
- Give him some whiskey. - No.
A Louisiana Flip.
Five minutes to 7:00.
Time drags when you're tired.
I was in the hospital the whole night, walking up and down the corridor.
They wouldn't let me see her. And I have to stay chained to this desk.
Did you find that young lady for Mr. Preysing?
- His secretary.
Yes, they're over there. - That's all.
His secretary.
- Would you like a little cognac?
Nothing? - One cognac for me. - Very good, sir.
You wanted to see me?
Yes. Pardon me. I must go to England.
It's very important. I must go at once.
I have some very big deals... involving hundreds of thousands of marks... and I thought I would take along a secretary... to take care of my correspondence.
You know what I mean.
I understood you to say that you traveled and....
You understand?
I understand you perfectly, Mr. Preysing.
What would you want for such a trip?
- Marks? You mean money? - Yes.
I don't know. I'd have to figure it up.
I'd need clothes and shoes... and it's cold in England in March.
And I'd need a suit. - You'd want me to look nice?
I should say 1,000 marks.
- Is that too much?
- No. That is all right.
Would you like me to get you a room here... at the hotel? Now?
- Hello, Baron. - Would you please pay some attention?
- How do you do?
- Insolence.
You mean the Baron?
- Baron what?
He's a gentleman.
Is the Baron tired?
No, not tired exactly.
I thought this evening we could go to the casino.
That place we passed with the wonderful bright lights.
Kringelein, I'd adore it. I can't go anywhere.
- I'm broke.
- No, you're joking.
- Yes. Isn't it odd?
A baron, broke.
- I quit.
- You can't.
I'm not getting those pearls, neither are you.
- What about the money?
- I'll pay you back.
- How? - I have an idea working in my head.
You might find a bullet through that head.
If you do that you'll get nothing, except maybe the police after you.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car! If you wait, I'll pay you back your 5,000...
Go on, Suzette.
Are you coming to the theater?
I shall dance tonight. How I shall dance! I want to feel that you're there.
- I'm worried about you. - Don't be.
- You'll be on the train?
- Until then. - Bless you.
- Was the Baron joking?
- What? - Is it really true?
- What are you talking about, Kringelein?
Is the Baron really in financial straits?
To tell you the truth, I must get some money somehow right away.
- If the Baron will permit me. - What?
I'd be awfully glad to oblige.
You've been very decent to me.
Three hundred?
If I could get into a game of some kind, I think I might win.
Gambling!
I'd love that!
I've got over 6,800 marks right here.
If we could scare up some men to play.
- We could go up to my room.
- That's a grand idea.
- Cab, miss? - What?
- Cab? - No, thanks. I'll walk.
- 4,000 marks. - 4,000!
Too high?
4,000 marks.
- Want a card?
- 8,000 marks. - 8,000!
- I take it all.
- That's a lot of money.
I need it, thanks.
- Want a card?
Will you help me again, please?
I think you'd better help me, Kringelein.
- Make your bets, gentlemen.
- How much shall I bet?
- How much is left in the bank?
- 2,500 uncovered.
- Do you feel like going that far?
- All that money, Baron?
Come on, you're killing them tonight.
Go ahead, old man.
Do you want a card?
What have you got?
The old highwayman.
He has nine again.
I win again!
Come on, gentlemen. Please drink! Drink.
It's wonderful and sweet champagne!
Mr. Kringelein, care to take the bank?
Yes! Surely. I'll take everything.
I'll take anything.
Come on, now. Drink, gentlemen.
Please drink some champagne.
It's expensive and good.
What will I take the bank for?
- I'll play for 500.
- Baron, all at once?
Suppose you lose it?
It's all the same thing, Kringelein.
Come on, now, old man.
Deal me two cards.
One to me first.
One to yourself.
One to me.
One to yourself.
Baron, if all that money....
What have you got?
I've got a nine! Isn't that a wonderful thing?
Kringelein, you old robber, you're hopeless.
Baron! Baron, please.
It's no use, old man. It's sweet of you...
- but you have all the luck. - It's true.
I have luck, for the first time in my life! I have luck!
Baron, are you out? Have you finished playing?
Yes, thank you. I'll recover again presently, in 10 or 20 years.
Look, Doctor. I've won again!
There you are.
Baron, I win and drink, and drink and win!
Gentlemen, please don't go.
Be my guests. Don't go.
I beg your pardon.
I know I oughtn't to presume, but I'm so grateful to you.
It's been so marvelous.
For the first time in my life, I've gambled and I've danced.
You gentlemen can laugh... but for the first time in my life, I've tasted life!
- Splendid! - Life is wonderful, but it's very dangerous.
If you have the courage to live it, it's marvelous.
- Wonderful! - You don't know about that.
You're healthy and happy. But I, believe me... if a man doesn't know death, he doesn't know life.
- It's a short life, but a gay one. - Please, gentlemen, don't go.
Come on.
Drink to life... to the magnificent, dangerous... brief, wonderful life.
- Kringelein! - And the courage to live it.
You know, I've only lived since last night... but that little while seems longer than all the time that's gone before.
Take him over to his bed.
How is he, Doctor?
- It will be over in a minute.
- It's only just begun.
- Quiet, Kringelein.
I'm not afraid, Doc.
- I'm not afraid to die. - There, there.
You'll be all right.
Too much iced champagne.
You old drunkard.
- My pocketbook.
I've lost my pocketbook.
14,000 marks in that pocketbook.
- I've got to find it.
- No, stay where you are.
No, I've got to find that. - Kringelein! - 14,000 marks.
14,000 marks were in that pocketbook.
You don't know what that money means to a man like me.
You've never lived like a dog in a hole... and scrimped and saved.
You did not see his pocketbook, did you, Baron?
My life hangs on that money, Baron.
Nobody ever gives you anything for nothing.
You have to buy everything, and pay cash for it.
I wanted to pay for my last days with that money.
I must find it!
I haven't anything in the world but that pocketbook!
Every hour costs money.
Here's your pocketbook, you silly old thing.
- There's your money.
- You found it!
That's it. You found it.
I'm very glad he got it back. 14,000 marks.
Yes. It's a lot of money, isn't it?
- Good night, Kringelein.
- Don't go, Baron. Don't leave me.
- I must, old man.
It's late, I'm sorry.
- No. Please don't go!
I must, old man. It's late.
Good night, Kringelein.
Stay a while, Baron.
I'm sorry. I can't, old man.
I have no time.
- Hello, funny one.
What are you doing here at this time?
Looking for my room. 164.
- Do you live here?
- Yes, for tonight.
Such is life, Flaemmchen.
You're nice.
Good night... funny one.
You were superb tonight.
What a success!
Yes. It was a triumph, wasn't it?
Madame will return to Berlin soon?
Who knows, monsieur?
Do be sensible.
Shall I come and talk about the music now, or not?
No. Not tonight.
Pimenov, go and find him.
- Hello. I've been waiting in there for you.
I had to arrange about the trip.
- You're very sweet. - Thank you.
You know, you are entirely different from what I expected.
- Different? How?
I thought you were more of a coquette... not so ladylike.
Wouldn't you like to call me by the first name?
No, I couldn't do that.
- I don't know.
One can't get intimate just offhand.
I could go to England with you and all that, but....
I always say that nothing should be left hanging over.
And names are like that.
Supposing I met you next year and I said: "How do you do, Mr. Preysing."
And you said, "That's the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester."
That's all quite proper.
But supposing I saw you and yelled: "Hi, baby!
Remember Manchester?"
And you were with your wife.
How would you like that?
We will leave my wife out of this, Flaemmchen, please.
- Sorry. - I didn't mean that.
You are very slender, aren't you?
- Think so?
- Are you going to be nice to me?
- Very nice?
- That's what you expect, isn't it?
You like me just a little bit, don't you?
You're still a stranger to me, but that doesn't matter.
It's you, Baron.
What are you doing in this room here?
- This your room, Preysing?
- Yes, this is my room.
Sorry. I must've made a mistake.
We shall see whether you made a mistake or not.
That door is locked, Baron.
Yes. I came through here.
Here. I want that pocketbook.
- What do you mean?
- I want that pocketbook. Give it to me!
- Certainly. - So that's how we stand, Baron.
Look here, Preysing... I'm completely at your mercy.
I was desperate.
It's a matter of life and death.
I had to get some money tonight, somehow.
Yes, you did have to get some money tonight... but you're going to jail.
You're going to be locked up. - Why, you're a thief!
- Be quiet.
Quiet?
Yeah, quiet! You danced with Flaemmchen when I wanted to transact business with her.
You, the nice friend of the nice Mr. Kringelein.
- Do you want to wake up the entire hotel?
I'll show them what a baron you are.
You are a thief!
I'll have you locked up. Here, you wait here.
Strike me, would you?
They're having a nice little game up there with that telephone.
Baron! Speak to me!
He tried to rob me. He's a thief.
Miss Flaemm, please don't leave me. Please, Miss Flaemm.
Hear me? Wake up!
- The Baron. - The Baron?
Go quickly. The Baron. Do you hear me?
- Where? - Preysing's room.
Here. Take it. You thief, you.
I must get out of here.
Mr. Kringelein, he robbed me.
He struck me.
Baron. Dead, just like that.
His eyes are still open.
He looks so peaceful.
It can't be so hard to die.
That pocketbook he stole from me.
It's just like it was.
I haven't touched nothing.
Maybe he did try to take your pocketbook... but you don't kill a man for that.
You don't kill a man about a pocketbook.
Poor Baron, he wanted money so badly.
- Where is Miss Flaemm?
- I'll take care of her.
She's working with that man.
She enticed me into her room while he robbed me here.
- I'll tell that to the court.
- To the court?
Mr. Kringelein, I must talk with you before the police come.
Miss Flaemm is in your room?
- Yes.
- She's in your room.
No one will know that I was with her.
You were with her.
They will not interrogate you. They will not ask you any questions.
You cannot give no testimony. Neither can she say anything.
But what you are proposing is falsification of the evidence.
My existence is hanging by a thread.
A scandal with that woman would mean ruin for me.
- But you've just killed a man!
- That makes no difference!
I beg your pardon. It makes all the difference in the world.
- We're going to call the police.
- No! Please, Mr. Kringelein.
I will give you money, anything. You can go away. Please.
- I have enough money.
- Mr. Kringelein, please help me.
- My life is in your hands.
- Your life.
What about my life, when you had it in your hands?
But I can send you back to Friedersdorf.
I can give you a very good position in Friedersdorf.
Many, many thanks, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing...
- but I am never going back to Friedersdorf. - Don't, please.
Worry about yourself.
Don't worry about me.
No, Mr. Kringelein, please don't call...
Hello! There's been a murder here.
I don't understand you.
Murder?
- They're drinking. - What?
Yes. What is it? Is this a joke?
Hurry up. Someone in 166 says there's been a murder.
166?
Preysing?
- What time is it, Suzette?
- It's 3:00 in the morning, Madame.
Tired, Suzette?
- Is Madame not tired?
- No, Suzette. - Madame has changed her dress again.
The music has stopped.
How quiet it is tonight.
It was never so quiet in the Grand Hotel.
Those flowers make me think of funerals.
- Don't they you, Suzette? - It's just nerves, Madame, nerves.
Suzette, we're going to take a holiday soon.
Six weeks in Tremezzo.
I'm going to live like a real woman... perfectly simple, perfectly quiet, perfectly happy.
- Yes, Madame. - We'll have a guest.
Certainly, Madame. But Madame must sleep now. The train will soon go.
I suppose so.
Call Baron von Geigern's room, please.
Keep ringing. He must be asleep.
Come and fetch me, chéri...
I'm longing for you.
I kept thinking that you might come to me.
But he must answer.
Why don't you answer the phone, please?
Yes. Ring.
Where are you?
- Forty-two. - Let's go to work, boys.
- Are these things necessary?
- I'm afraid so, Mr. Preysing.
We've taken care of all that, Mr. Preysing.
The night porter's gone. You're late.
I was at the clinic the whole night.
- My wife, poor girl.
- The child hasn't come yet?
No. But I mustn't let it interfere with my duty.
- You won't forget that? - No, sir.
- I'm going now. - Yes, Doctor.
- A killing in 166.
Who? The big manufacturer Preysing killed Baron von Geigern.
Good heavens! What for?
- That's terrible!
- He was a nice fellow.
- They say he was a thief.
I don't believe it.
He was a real gentleman.
I'm so tired I can't hardly see out of my eyes.
No sleep for two nights, here all day, and now this killing at the hotel.
- Good morning. Show your hands. Hands.
- Change those gloves. - Yes, sir.
Too bad about the Baron.
You always felt better when he came along.
- Always friendly, such an agreeable fellow.
Where are you taking that dog?
- Baron von Geigern. - Give it to me.
Better take charge of this dog. It belonged to the Baron.
- They have taken him away? - Yes. Wasn't it terrible?
Madame must not know. You understand? Madame must not know!
All right, I can tell it to the maids, but I can't answer for downstairs.
- Are you all right, Miss Flaemmchen? - Yes.
I was just thinking about the Baron.
Lying there, with his eyes so open.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
What if he was a burglar?
- They don't kill a man for that.
- He was desperate.
He tried to raise money all day.
And he laughed, poor devil.
And a man like Preysing has to kill him.
You know, I didn't like Preysing right off.
Why did you have anything to do with him?
- Money. - Money.
- You don't understand that, do you? - Yes, I do.
- Do you really? - Yes, I do.
I could take care of you, Miss Flaemmchen, if you'd let me.
I have enough money.
There's 10,200 marks in this pocketbook... and there's 3,400 that I won last night.
That would last a long time.
I could win some more.
We could travel.
- Travel?
- Yes, to Paris.
- I've always wanted to go to Paris.
- Anywhere you like. Here.
I'll give you this money I won last night. 3,400...
- and then later you can have some more.
- Later? Yes, when I....
I'm ill, Flaemmchen.
I won't live long.
Will you stay with me?
That's nonsense!
We'll find a great doctor. He'll cure you.
- They can cure anything these days.
- You think so?
Do you think you'd have as good a time with me... as you did with Preysing?
- Why, of course. - Really?
- Yes. - You like me better than you did him?
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein.
A very good man.
You know, I never thought anything so beautiful could come to me.
We'll catch the first train to Paris.
Order two tickets now. Come on.
Yes. What time does the next train leave?
- He'll be on the train.
- But how do you know?
Baron von Geigern has left? When?
The Baron left about half an hour ago.
Gru, come, come. We'll lose the train.
Come along, the train will be going.
- Please come, madam, please.
- I'll ask myself.
- What is the use of asking?
He'll be there. - Have you seen Baron von Geigern?
The Baron is not here, madam.
- Has he gone? - Yes, madam.
- We haven't any time to waste.
We have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow.
The sun. It'll be sunny in Tremezzo.
We'll have a guest, Suzette.
- Head porter's desk. Mr. Senf?
Just a moment. Hospital.
The child has come.
It's a boy.
- And your wife?
- My wife is well.
Hello. Hospital? I'll be with you on lunch hour.
176, 170, 168, 166. - Is Your Excellency leaving? - A cab, please.
- A cab for His Excellency. - My bill, and the lady's, too.
- Have you got your tickets? - My tickets.
- Tickets for Mr. Kringelein. - Thank you.
Your forwarding address?
The Grand Hotel, in Paris.
How do you know there will be one?
There's a Grand Hotel everywhere in the world.
- Goodbye, Doctor. Pain's gone already?
Pain. I have none, Doctor.
- I beg your pardon. Where's the money? Hurry.
Please be careful of that.
Grand Hotel. Always the same.
People come, people go.
Nothing ever happens.

I've got to take back Mrs. Miller's laundry.
All right, Mom.
Jimmy!
Boooo!
I didn't scare you, did I Mom?
Full off tricks.
Just like your father was, ain't ya?
I'll teach you! For frightening me!
Well, Ma, you haven't lost your punch, have ya?
You'd better run along.
I got a lot of work to do.
It's me, Jimmy.
Oh, Mom, it's me... Mom!
Oh, Mother!
Oh, Mother!
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Catch a nigger...
Hello, son. Who are you lookin' for?
The Clarks. All right.
Well, my name's Clark.
Are you Uncle Henry? Uncle Henry?
Yeah, are you Lucy's boy?
Yes, sir, I'm Jimmy.
Well, that's funny.
How'd you get so far away from home?
It's in the letter.
How is your mother?
She's... dead.
Lucy dead?
It's all right, my boy.
I'll go tell your Aunt Emmie.
My poor sister...
And that poor boy.
Don't cry, Aunt Emma.
Now Emmie, don't make it harder for the boy.
Oh, my spinach!
That's Mr. Kelly.
Mr. Kelly's our boarder.
Hiya, Countess!
Well, I knew your dark past would catch up on you someday.
No, Mr. Kelly! This is my nephew, Jimmy Mason.
Oh, hello, Jimmy.
Glad to see you.
Say, if I knew you were gonna be here for dinner I'd have stopped at the City Hall Square and shot a buffalo or an alderman or something.
Say, I won't be here at dinner tonight.
No, I'm steppin' out.
With who? His Honor, the Mayor.
That's a break for you, Jimmy. You can have my spinach.
Well, over the river and skip the gutter.
Be seeing you, folks.
You can sleep on the couch.
I suppose you're awful tired after riding around all day. Yes, mam.
Hiya, Peggy!
Say, how you look gorgeous! I've been to a conference...
I've been waiting for you... I've been to a conference!
Conference!
Let me tell you. This can't last forever.
Do you expect me to marry you?
Listen, honey, when we're married...
If we're married!
And I'm not at all sure I want to marry a man who keeps me waiting around like this.
Frank Gebhardt, editor of the Morning Times.
Great guy, Frank.
You know him intimately, no doubt.
Why, we're like this!
Hi, Frank!
How do you do?
Do I know that man I just spoke to?
No, Mr. Gebhardt.
What's his idea in calling me Frank?
Well, you may know him, but he's not speaking to you.
That's nothing, honey.
He's so nearsighted many a time he passes up his own mother.
Listen, I know a new spaghetti joint you're going to be crazy about.
Come on, honey, we'll step right in the car and I'll drive you right down there...
Is he asleep?
I always wanted a boy around the house.
Outside of you, of course.
First thing tomorrow I'll take him around to school.
No, I don't want you to do that.
I don't want you to be late for...
You haven't lost your job again?
What are we going to do now?
We've another mouth to feed.
We've all pulled through before, haven't we?
Maybe I'll get a better job.
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll run down and get a newspaper now and look through the want ads.
Everything'll be all right.
Now watch, Jimmy.
Watch closely this time.
Oh, it's the music in my soul, Jimmy.
I'm so full of it I leak.
When I come in the door Rudy Vallee goes right out the window.
Do you know Rudy Vallee?
Do I know Rudy Vallee.
Do I know him.
The megaphone was my idea.
Well, I gotta be going.
Here you are, Jimmy.
There's a dollar. That'll help you open a couple of banks.
Thanks, Mr. Kelly.
Mr. Kelly! Yeah?
Could I talk to you for a moment?
Sure, grab your hat and make it snappy.
Aunt Emma! I'm gonna walk down the street with Mr. Kelly.
All right, son.
Well, what's on your mind, Jimmy?
Well, you see, Mr. Kelly, it's like this.
Hiya, Red.
You know, Red Gray, the football player.
Was that Red Gray?
Sure.
Hiya, Kelly.
Hiya, boys.
What were you saying, Jim?
Well, you know Uncle Harry and Aunt Emma...
Hey, Kelly! Yeah?
Go ahead, Jimmy, what were you going to tell me?
How are you, Kelly?
Hiya, Commissioner.
Guess you know nearly everybody, Mr. Kelly.
Well, I'll tell you, Jimmy. I've got a lot of connections.
That's the reason I wanted to talk to you.
Well, well, well.
Jimmy, here's one for the book.
Remember we went to that fortune teller this afternoon?
Y-y-yeah.
Oh, did you?
And he said we'd be walking down the street just like this.
Remember, Jimmy?
And he said we'd walk into the most beautiful girl in all the world.
He was right at that point, wasn't he?
And he said huh...
Well, he said a lot of things that happened, remember?
Yeah, a lot of things.
For instance.
Let's see, for instance he said uh...
He said uh...
Well, he said I'd ask her to go dancing, remember?
Did he say where?
Did he say where, Jim?
Sure he did.
He said we'd go to the Rosalind Dance Palace.
Oh, that was the place.
Oh, I get it.
I catch on to you.
You're the girl he was talking about all the time.
Who is this person?
This is Mr....
Peggy, I want you to meet a pal of mine, Jimmy Mason.
Hello, Jimmy.
You were only kidding.
You knew her all the time.
Know her?
Say, I've known her since she was that big.
Come on in while I leave these things.
I'll take them, Peggy.
Come on, Jimmy.
Sit down, Jimmy.
Turn on the radio. Sure.
Not bad, eh, Jimmy?
Say, she's a swell girl.
Hey, you oughta read the story in here by Erle Cowan.
You know him too?
Oh, sure, we're like that.
Say, have I shown you this trick that I do? I don't think so. I know I didn't.
How do you like that, Jim.
It's marvelous, Mr. Kelly.
Jimmy, weren't you trying to tell me something?
Oh, that. I was...
Why, Jimmy, how nice! Getting up on me.
Well, they always do it in the movies.
Take Mr. Kelly to the movies sometime, won't you, Jimmy?
I would've gotten up, if it hadn't been for that sore knee of mine.
Oh, well, if you got a sore knee, you can't stand.
What do you think of a man who asks a girl to go dancing and then has a sore knee?
Did your mother let you associate with people like that?
Oh, Jimmy!
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't have...
That's all right.
Atta boy, Jimmy.
The old chin up all the time.
Ma would've liked you.
Mr. Kelly, too.
Jimmy, I want you to promise me something. Yes, mam?
Anytime you feel lonesome will you come and see me?
Could I?
Any time you want.
Sure, thanks.
I sure will.
Hey, Jim, when you get through cutting me out with my girl how about going back to your aunt and uncle?
I can't understand you.
I guess it's for you.
I called you up to say that I've got everything under control.
Everything is exactly as if you were right here.
Right here!
Hello!
Say, what's the matter with you? You're...
Sorry, babe, but that was important.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
If I can't make it, I'll phone.
Never mind. I'll know if you're coming. Yeah?
How do you know?
I'll call up that fortune teller. Oh... all right. So long, darling.
Just thought of something, and it's getting late...
Well, good night. Good night, Jimmy.
Remember you're coming to see me again. Well, good night. I had a very good time.
Oh... why don't you answer, Kelly?
At it again, huh?
Well, you're through.
Get out!
Oh, Kelly, you wouldn't talk to an old pal that way...
But you'll be sorry for this tomorrow. When you sober up.
Oh... I found you.
Gee, ain't you talented?
You don't mind, do you?
Well...
You see... with Uncle Henry getting laid off and me coming unexpected the way I did... it's kinda hard on them.
And I thought, well, knowing every one the way you do, you could help me get a job.
Well, maybe I can.
Maybe I can.
I'd like to work for you, Mr. Kelly.
Yeah, you would?
You be here first thing in the morning.
Say, it's getting kinda late. You'd better run along, hadn't you?
Thanks, Mr. Kelly.
Good night. So long.
Three quarts of what?
Okay, I'll bring them right over.
Yeah, so long. Of course it's none of my business, but I'm sure they're bootleggers.
I've done my duty and I expect you to do yours. Hi, Commissioner. Hello, kid.
Now listen, Jimmy. This is what I want you to do.
You see, I'm in and out of this place all day long.
All I want you to do is answer the phone.
If somebody calls, tell them I'm out and get their number.
You can do that?
Sure I can.
Here's another thing.
I do all my business over that phone.
That door is supposed to stay locked all the time.
You don't know who owns the place, you don't know where you live 'cause I live there too, you don't even know my name.
Yes, but why, Mr. Kelly?
Well you see, Jimmy, it's like this.
I got a lot of big connections, you know that, don't you? Yes, sir.
Well, you see, a man in my position he's liable to have a lot of enemies.
You never know what they might try to do. Sure.
So, if anything goes wrong, no matter what it is... you get in touch with me on the quiet. But be sure it's on the quiet.
And you don't know me at all.
Oh, I get it!
That's the stuff.
And remember, Jimmy...
Kelly's your friend.
A guy that'll always stand behind you.
And I'll do the same for you, too.
K.O., Jimmy.
K.O!
Now, shuffle on.
Oh, and Jimmy...
Yes, sir?
Get a load of this.
I'm paying you 25 bucks a week.
Whoopee!
K.O.!
K.O.
Open that door!
Open up that door!
Hey, say... have you been here before?
You're taking it pretty easy for a first-timer.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
What do you mean, nothing's gonna happen?
It's happening.
Yeah, but I got a friend. With connections.
And he'll walk in here any minute.
Burton.
Edward Burton.
Relatives and witnesses come this way.
Kelly!
Patrick Kelly.
James Mason.
Say, that friend of yours better get his connections working.
How old are you, James?
Ever been in trouble before?
No place in particular.
Parents dead? Yes, sir.
Haven't you any relatives in this town?
Someone that we ought to notify about this?
No relatives anywhere.
Obviously you wouldn't have found yourself in this trouble if you hadn't been led astray by someone older... more responsible, would you?
Would you?
Now, come, James. We want to give you every chance to cooperate with us.
Now, it isn't you, but the man who hired you that we want to reach.
And your failure to expose him is really a more serious offense than the other charges against you.
Now come, who was he?
Very well, then. You leave me no alternative.
I'm sorry to have to do this. But you'll spend the next three years in the State Industrial School for Boys.
The new bedding number, sir.
Do you want to come out and give them a speech?
Oh, I suppose so.
How many of them are there? Eleven.
And two repeaters.
Two repeaters.
Always the repeaters.
James Mason. Yes, sir?
13144.
Attention. Mr. Thompson has something to say to you boys.
Boys, you are here to be made into good citizens.
I trust that you'll take advantage of this opportunity.
You'll be taught a trade at which you can earn an honest living when you are released.
Obey the rules and you can profit by this experience.
Disobey them and you will be punished.
In other words, you will get out of this Institution exactly what you put into it.
That's all. All right, you... 3172, lower.
There's yours 13144, upper deck.
First thing you do get in there.
13974, upper.
14671, floor.
15682, upper.
19243, upper.
Where'd you come from?
I got the bed up above.
All right, then get your things and scram up where you belong.
I just thought I'd undress down here. Oh, yeah? Say!
Hey, what's going on here?
What's all this raucous about?
Aw, something fell.
Well, stay on your feet and get up those clothes.
Okay, big boy.
You can sit down here any time you want to.
K.O.!
How long are you in for?
Do they let you write letters from here?
Sure, three a month.
I won't be here long.
You gotta be careful.
They read everything you write.
Did the super give you the welcome speech when you first came in? Yeah. Well, that's some kid getting his so he can learn by experience.
What's it like up here anyhow?
Aw, the food's terrible.
But you can get used to it.
And they make you sweat like a dog in the brickyard.
Brickyard?
Yeah. That's the way they support this place.
They haven't got enough money to run it so they make us kids work for it.
How do they treat you?
Well, some of the guards are okay and some of them are plenty tough.
They lay off me.
I got a break.
The old pump.
It ain't no good.
The heart, I mean.
Yeah, I guess you are.
I didn't think you brought me down here to listen to my charming conversation.
Charlie, don't let what I've said give you the impression it has anything to do with our friendship.
I'm not asking you to do a thing you don't want to do.
You're only asking me to sacrifice my job to become the goat for reform movement.
That's not the idea at all.
What I want you to do is to be a man.
You know what conditions in this school are now.
You know how badly you need the money from this bond issue to correct them.
And I know you feel the way I do.
You'd like to see things improve.
You'd like to see these kids given a chance.
Wouldn't you?
I could bring about these changes. But only by arousing public interest.
By printing the truth.
Now listen, Charlie, This is something that's got to be done.
I'm not asking you to do it.
Now on Thursday I'll appear at the school unexpectedly.
With a pass.
You don't know anything about it, how I got it.
All I'm asking is that you let me see with my own eyes conditions as they really are.
Not the Sunday School act you put on for visitors.
Will you do this, Charlie?
I've got to be going, Frank.
Well, Frank, I'll see you on Thursday.
Hey, Jimmy. I'm gonna give you two now.
That's what all us old timers do.
Supposing I don't catch 'em?
Oh, you'll just smash a finger.
Oh, is that all?
Sure, what do you care? You got ten of them.
I caught 'em.
Okay, big boy.
What, again?
Sure, you gotta get used to it.
Well, guess that's all.
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of minutes.
Get more bricks.
More bricks?
You're just warming up.
Boy, they sure make you work in this place. Yeah. Say, ain't you the guy with the connections?
Yeah, what of it?
I thought your friend was gonna get you out of this.
Well he is, and it's none of your business.
Hey. You want me to show you how to pile up those bricks so it'll be easy on you?
Hey, Jack, here's the new kid.
Let's show him how to pile up the bricks.
New kid, eh? Yeah.
This is gonna be swell for your muscles too.
Pretty strong, all right.
Yeah. You oughta see me when I first did this.
There! Now let's see your influential friend get you out of this.
Hey, what's the big idea?
Who did that? I did it!
You can't do that to him.
He's my pal.
What's going on? You do you boys think this is, a playground?
Now, just for this monkey business you'll get no recreation hour.
Now get going! Come on there, you!
What's the good of my standing over our stove half the day if you don't eat something?
I don't see what Jimmy could have done.
But Mr. Kelly thought...
Mr. Kelly!
While he thought and we sat here...
Maybe we could have done something.
Now, Emmie, Mr. Kelly did everything he could.
He used all of his influence and he couldn't do nothing.
What could we have done?
At least we can go up to the school and see him as soon as Mr. Kelly gets us that pass. Hiya, baby, baby, baby!
Oh, stop it! What's the matter with you?
I just washed my hands and can't do a thing to do with them.
Say, get a pipe of that new backdrop, will you?
Gee! I bet you had to fight the women off every step of the way.
No, I fixed that.
I got a police car.
Have you heard from Jimmy?
No, not a word.
Well, I guess he's gone for good.
You know. I can't get that poor kid off my mind.
How could a boy just disappear?
I can't figure it.
Haven't I tried everything?
Police, hospitals, Sheriff's office.
I guess he just beat it. I don't know.
I was just wondering if...
How's it for you getting into that Derby of yours?
We got a lot of staying up to do tonight.
Just a minute.
What a heel you are, Kelly.
Hey, Jimmy.
Yeah? How are you coming?
Gosh but it's hard writing in the dark.
I hope Mr. Kelly will be able to read it.
Say, Shorty, I don't see how this'll ever get to him if I don't sign it or address it.
Okay, big boy.
You see, I slip it to this big guy in the hospital and tell him the address. Then he writes it on the envelope when he gets it outside.
Say, Shorty, how do you spell "terrible"?
Oh, never mind how you spell it.
Just write it.
I'm coming to the part about getting you out too. We're gonna stick together.
Okay, big boy.
What's the matter with you?
I swallowed a couple of peas.
You're lucky to get peas.
What about it?
I need it in print shop, tied. Does it bother you any?
No, but I didn't think it would be good for me to keep on working.
Work won't hurt you.
There's only one thing that would fix you up.
I'm beginning to feel fine.
The water's over there.
I keep on getting them dizzy spells.
You're the kid that got that bump on the head.
Yeah, in the brickyard.
You'll have to wait till Tuesday when the doctor comes up.
But here's some aspirin.
Next.
Hey, you! You're next.
Well, what's the matter now?
I thought maybe you could give me some of that medicine the doctor gives me.
Oh, I don't feel so awful bad now.
I think maybe I could come back when the doctor's here.
Unbutton your coat.
All right, let's have it.
Why, your writing is nothing like this.
Now who wrote that?
It looks like that.
You see, I wrote it in the dark.
Now listen. You've been here long enough to know it's a serious offense to try to sneak a letter out.
Especially one that criticizes the school.
Now you tell me who wrote this and I'll go easy on you.
If you don't... If you don't, I'm gonna give you solitary.
I did it, I tell you.
All right, have it your own way.
You wrote it so you'll get six days in solitary confinement.
You couldn't put me in solitary...
Then tell me who wrote this letter.
All right, take him away.
Have you got 13144 here? Over there. 13144?
13144?
How would you like to be a monitor?
We need more monitors and you've been recommended.
If I were you, I'd take it.
You get better food, better sleeping quarters and special privileges.
Of course you'll get your responsibilities.
I guess so. Well, come on.
Where's Shorty?
How should I know?
You're supposed to relieve me? Yes, sir.
Those on the mourner's bench have two more hours to go.
You've got to see that they keep their eyes on that line every minute of it.
Those on the chalk line can loosen up in 45 minutes more.
Yes, sir.
Guards!
Guards!
How do you do, Mr. Gebhardt?
I'm sorry to have to tell you that Mr. Thompson won't be able to take you through the school personally.
However, he's instructed me to see that you go wherever you want to go.
I see. Now, what would you like to see first?
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Now, this is our correction room. The boys are made to study during the recreation period.
What do you use the white line for?
That?
Well, occasionally a disobedient boy is made to stand with his toes to that line while he studies.
Now, these are our punishment cells.
Is there anyone in them?
No. We only use these in case of emergency.
More comfortable than I expected.
Get back till I call you.
Now, would you like to see the dormitories?
I think not.
Well, Charlie, I've seen your Sunday School.
So, you've lost your nerve.
You double-crossed me.
What was the matter before?
Never mind.
Number 5.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, wake up!
Shorty!
Shorty, what's the matter?
It's Shorty, something's happened to him. He's just lying here.
Get someone quick! You get water.
I'll be back right away.
Shorty! Don't worry, Mom.
Shorty! Oh, don't cry, Mom.
It's me, don't you know me?
Gee, Mom, Jimmy's gonna be disappointed if Mr. Kelly doesn't get that letter.
Stop talking like that, Shorty.
Of course, it's different with him.
Come on, listen to me!
Listen!
Jimmy... what's the matter?
Atta boy, Shorty.
Now you're talking.
How did you get here, Jimmy?
I was bringing your supper, and you were just... Oh, gee...
Gee, that's great!
I thought maybe they got you, too.
Got me?
Is that why you're in here?
Did they find that letter?
Yeah, only I wasn't gonna tell you.
Shorty, you're doing this for me.
I'm gonna tell them.
I'll go tell them I wrote it.
Then you can get out.
That won't do any good.
They'll never let me off.
On account of I wouldn't tell them who wrote it.
Oh, I'll make them get you off. I'll tell them myself.
Aw, don't do that, Jimmy.
That won't help any.
That'll just put you in solitary, too.
I'll be all right.
The doc can fix me up.
He won't fix you up.
You told me yourself they could never fix you up in this place.
You need good doctors, and hospitals and everything.
I'll be all right.
I know what I 'll do.
I'll get out.
I'll get to Mr. Kelly.
I'll tell him all.
He'll get you out.
Shorty...
Shorty, do you...
Do you think you can stand it until I get a chance?
Is that all right?
Shorty!
Gee, it's great to be home, Mom.
It ain't nothing to die.
You're not going to die!
Here, get out of the way!
Take him to the hospital.
The doctor's on his way over.
Get back to your work. Oh, let me go with him.
Get back to your work!
I'm going with Shorty.
If you're not careful, you'll lose that.
I don't want it!
I hate it!
? Treating them like they weren't human beings!
Like Shorty.
I'm going with him!
Let me go!
Did you hear about Shorty?
Nothing.
They won't let you anywhere near the hospital.
You think he'll die?
Pick 'em up, you mug!
All right, you don't have to help me.
I'll do it myself.
You're darn tootin', you will.
I'm not letting my dinner get cold.
Get going.
How about it?
Let her go!
131443.
Here.
I don't see what good it does you to read the same thing over and over again.
I got a lot to do...
Is Mr. Kelly home?
He don't live here, don't you know that?
I don't care!
I gotta get Mr. Kelly right away. Where is he?
We don't know. But what good could he do?
Don't let them take you back again.
Not as long as I don't see Shorty! Shorty?
Yeah, I gotta get Mr. Kelly right away!
Get my coat and a shirt.
I think I know where I can find him!
Let me wipe your face. Hold your head up, Jimmy!
Hold your face. My goodness but you're dirty!
How in the world did you get that all over you?
Is Mr. Kelly here?
Better close the door.
Why, Jimmy, where have you...
Mr. Kelly!
Well, well, well, how's the weather in China?
Say, you oughta let your friends know when you duck out like that.
You had us worried.
I tried to let you know in the quiet like you told me.
But after the cops got me I didn't have a chance.
Shorty tried to get a letter out of the Reform School, but...
Reform School?
Say, they sent you to the Reform School?
Yeah, when I wouldn't tell them your name.
What does this mean?
Well, when the cops broke in and found all that liquor... of course I knew right away they were trying to get something on you, counting your connections.
I didn't want to see you about that. But there's something you gotta do, Mr. Kelly.
Not for me. But for a kid that's still up there, Shorty.
He's sick and unless we get him out of there right away, I'm afraid he's gonna die.
That's why I ran away.
Won't you do something, Mr. Kelly?
Gee, Shorty's a swell kid. You'd be crazy about him.
We got to do something quick before they catch me and take me back.
You're not going back!
No, Jimmy.
You're not going back.
I'll get in touch with the right...
Now wait a minute, let me think.
Frank Gebhardt of the Times. Just the man.
I'll go right down and see him...
Gee, Mr. Kelly! Why don't you phone him?
You can't settle a thing like this over the phone.
Phone him and see if he's there.
Say, that's a good idea.
Never mind.
I know the number.
Hello? Mr. Gebhardt, please.
Hello? Mr. Kelly calling Mr. Gebhardt.
Sure, he'll know.
Hello, Frank?
This is Kelly.
Kelly, what Kelly?
Why, couldn't be better.
Say, Frank, I wanna come right down and see you.
Listen...
I got some real front page dope for you.
Yeah. I got State Reform School stuff.
Well, all right.
Come down and see me.
Oh, no, Frank, I can't come to dinner. Thanks.
But I'll be right down.
And, so...
Well, let's go!
You're not doing him any good by not telling us where he went.
I tell you we don't know where he went.
He said he was going to see Mr. Kelly, a friend of his who used to be our boarder.
Where does this man Kelly live?
We don't know, and Jimmy didn't either.
He just uh... thought he could find him.
I guess they're on the up and up.
I guess so.
Now listen, if that kid comes back here tonight you keep him here and call Police Headquarters.
Why, Emmie! Don't you go well-Emmaing me!
You know a guy named Kelly that used to live over there?
Sure.
Hello, Frank.
What's your game?
What's the idea of calling me Frank?
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Gebhardt. I've been reading your column so long I... just got the feeling like I knew you. Hm-hmm.
You know, what I told you over the phone... the front page news, that's on the level.
I know a kid who just escaped from the Reform School.
This kid? Yep.
Your boy?
Well, no, he's a pal of mine.
What do you want out of it?
Except that he don't go back up there.
I can't promise that.
All right, the deal's off.
I can't say what I can do until I've heard the story.
But I'll do what I can.
He's outside now.
Bring him in.
Miss Maxwell, bring your book.
Herman, break down the front page.
Yes... yes, never mind about that now.
Jimmy, this is Mr. Gebhardt.
How are you, Jimmy?
Take my chair.
Jimmy, could you tell me how you got into the Reform School and what happened then?
Yes, sir. Take this, please.
All right, tell me about it.
Well, when I first came to live with Uncle Henry and Aunt Emma...
Say, Joe. Did you haul Kelly, his girl and a kid in the last half hour?
No. Have you seen anything of them?
No, not me.
Say, Art!
Who did you haul last?
Why, a young couple and a kid.
And when I got to Mr. Kelly I told him how badly Shorty needs help and he brought me down here.
I guess that's all.
Just transcribe that as quickly as possible, Miss Maxwell. Yes, sir.
Yes? Telegraph desk just got a wire on the Reform School, Mr. Gebhardt.
A kid died up there this afternoon.
They say it was a case of bad heart.
We're getting pictures. All right.
Jimmy, will you wait in the outer office.
There's something I want to talk to Mr. Kelly about. Yes, sir. Mr. Gebhardt...
Yes, Jimmy?
You and Mr. Kelly will do everything you can to get Shorty out of there right away, will you?
We'll do everything for him we possibly can.
Everything we possibly can.
Kelly, that phone call...
Shorty just died.
Aw, gee, that'll be tough on the kid.
I can keep Jimmy from going back to the Reform School. But I can't do it alone, Kelly.
You've got to help me.
What do you mean?
Just this.
I want a signed confession from you clearing the boy.
What's the idea of getting me mixed up in this?
The only way we can save him is by proving he was ignorant as to the nature of your business.
That means that you will have to admit what it is and how you deceived the boy.
You want that kid to go back up there?
But I ain't going to Leavenworth and that's that!
Hello, Jimmy.
That's him. Come along!
Call Mr. Gebhardt quick!
Mr. Gebhardt!
Well, gentlemen?
This kid ran away from Reform School, Mr. Gebhardt, and we're taking him back.
Wait a minute, boys.
I'm interested in this case. Will you sit down here for about 5 minutes?
Jimmy won't run away, will you, Jimmy?
Jimmy'll be starting back in 5 minutes.
Oh, you can't do it.
You made the kid believe you're the greatest guy on earth.
And then you hid behind him to save your own skin.
You let him go to Reform School because he wouldn't squeal when you told him not to.
And now you've got a chance to be the man he thinks you are, what are you going to do about it?
Are you going to let him down?
What are you, Kelly? A man or a rat?
You're a rat!
Will you come in here a minute, Jimmy? Yes, sir.
It'll be all right boys.
Jimmy...
You've got to go back to the Reform School.
There's only one man in the world who can help you. And he won't.
Jimmy, you didn't know it.
But the man you were working for was a bootlegger.
The liquor in that place wasn't planted there.
It belonged to him.
And now he's too small, too mean, too cowardly to do for you what you did for him.
Are you talking about Mr. Kelly?
Yes!
Listen, Mr. Gebhardt,
He may have been a bootlegger.
That may have been his liquor, but when you say he wouldn't do the same for me as I did for him, it's... it's a lie!
You're right, Jimmy.
You see, Frank's a great kidder.
He's got to have his little joke.
I didn't think he was kidding.
Sure he was, Jim.
Get Peggy, will you?
Let me.
Well, kid, looks like I gotta go away for a long time.
To... to... Yeah. Yep.
But, gee, Mr. Kelly,
Oh, now, look at it this way, kid.
We're pals, ain't we?
Sure! Sure we are.
And you took it on the chin, didn't you?
Well, now I'm gonna take it on the chin.
And what happens?
Mr. Gebhardt gets a chance to clean up that Reform School and do things for a lot of kids.
That's the way to look at it, ain't it?
Yeah, yeah, that's the way to look at it.
And Shorty...
Sure, that's it.
Think of Shorty.
Oh, please don't, babe.
How is it now, Shorty?
Okay, big boy.
And so, in retiring as president of this college, it is indeed a painful task to bid you all goodbye.
And now, with the utmost pleasure, may I present the man who is to guide the destiny of this great institution:
Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff!
Professor, it is an honor to welcome you to Huxley College.
Never mind that, hold this coat.
By the way, there's no smoking.
That's what you said.
It would please the faculty if you would throw your cigar away.
The faculty can keep their seats.
There'll be no diving for this cigar.
Members of the faculty, faculty members, students of Huxley and Huxley students!
I guess that covers everything.
I thought my razor was dull until I heard his speech.
Which reminds me of a story so dirty I'm ashamed to think of it myself.
As I look at your faces, I understand why this college is flat on its back.
At my last college, it was slightly different. I was flat on my back.
Things went from bad to worse, but we all pulled together, and soon I was flat on my back again.
Any questions?
Any answers?
Any rags? Any bones?
Any bottles today? And rags...
Let's have some action around here.
Who'll say 76?
Who'll say 1776?
That's the spirit! 1776!
You'd like to know why I'm here.
I came here to get my son out.
I remember the day he left: A mere boy and a beardless youth.
I kissed them both goodbye. By the way, where is my son?
Young lady, would you get up so I can see the son rise?
So, doing your homework in school, eh?
- Hello, old-timer!
I'm sure the students would appreciate an outline of your future plans.
- I said they would appreciate an outline of your future plans.
You just said that.
That's the trouble around here: Talk, talk, talk.
I think I must go mad.
Where will it all end?
What is it getting you?
Go home to your wife.
No, I'll go home to your wife.
Outside of the improvement, she'll never know the difference.
Pull over to the side of the road and let me see your marriage licence.
President Wagstaff, now that you have stepped into my shoes...
Oh, is that what I stepped in?
At least you could have cleaned them.
- The trustees have a few suggestions.
I think you know what the trustees can do with their suggestions.
"I don't know what they have to say, it makes no difference anyway, Whatever it is, I'm against it.
No matter what it is and who commenced it, I'm against it.
Your proposition may be good, but let's have one thing understood.
I'm against it!
And even when you've changed it or condensed it, I'm against it.
I'm opposed to it.
On general principles opposed to it."
"He's opposed to it.
In fact it seems that he's opposed to it!"
"For months before my son was born, I used to yell from night to morn:
Whatever it is, I'm against it!
And I've kept yelling since I first commenced it: I'm against it!"
"Knowing Dad as I do, I'd not advise you to displease him, or tease him. No, no!
Don't double-cross him or toss him around. When dear old Dad once gets mad he's a hound!"
"My son is right, I'm quick to fight, I'm from a fighting clan.
When I'm abused or badly used, I always get my man.
No matter if he's in Peru, Peduka or Japan, I go ahead, alive or dead, I always get my man."
"He goes ahead, alive or dead, he always gets his man."
"I soon dispose of all of those who put me on the pan.
As Shakespeare said to Nathan Hale:
I always get my man."
"He always gets his man!"
"That's what I said." - "He always gets his man!"
"That's what I mean." - "He always gets his man!"
"You're telling me?" - "He always gets his man!" - "Oh, are you listening?"
"He gets his man! He gets his man!"
"I always get, I always get,
I always get, I always get, I always get,
I always get my man!"
Splendid, Professor!
- Congratulations!
Marvellous!
- Alright scram, boys, I'll meet you in the barber shop.
Dad, let me congratulate you. I'm proud to be your son.
My boy, you took the words out of my mouth:
I'm ashamed to be your father.
You're a disgrace to the family name Wagstaff, if such a thing is possible.
What's this about you fooling around with the college widow?
No wonder you've been 12 years in the same college!
I went to 3 colleges in 12 years and fooled around with 3 widows.
At your age I went to bed right after supper.
Sometimes before supper.
Or I went without supper, and didn't go to bed.
A college widow stood for something in those days.
She stood for plenty.
There's nothing between me and her.
- Then you're crazy to fool with her.
- I don't want to talk to you about this again, you snob!
I'd horsewhip you, if I had a horse. You may go now.
Leave your name with the girl outside. We'll be in touch with you.
Where are you going?
- You just told me to go.
That's what they teach you here?
I tell you to go and you leave me?
You know you can't leave a school-room without raising your hand.
This school has had a new president every year since 1888, when we won our last football game.
I like education as well as the next man...
- Then let me talk to him.
...but besides education, this college needs a good football team.
And for a good football team, you need good football players.
- My boy, I think you've got something. I'll wait outside until you clean it up.
One more question: Where do you get good football players?
In the speakeasy...
- In a speakeasy?
Isn't that against the law, selling football players in a speakeasy?
Two of the best players in the country hang out there.
You suggest that I go there, without even giving me the address?
42, Elm Street.
But you can't go there, it isn't ethical.
It's not right for a college to buy football players. - It isn't, eh?
Well, come on and we'll have a nip.
Better still, you wait here.
Anything further, Father?
- "Anything further, Father?" That can't be right.
Isn't it "Anything Father, further?" The idea!
I married your mother because I wanted children.
Imagine my disappointment with you!
"And I kept yelling since I first commenced it:
I'm against it!"
That's my proposition.
How about it?
It's OK with us, Mr. Jennings, but how are you gonna fix it?
You'll be entered as Darwin students to play in the game against Huxley.
Yeah, but how about the dough?
- Here's a little to start with.
You get the balance after the game.
With you boys playing for Darwin,
Huxley can't win. - You said it!
- Here's to dear old Darwin.
Alright boys, let's go.
Bye.
- So long.
Baravelli!
Yes, lady, this is Baravelli, the ice man. What do you want?
One quart of scotch, one quart of rye.
Hold on, I see if I got 'em.
One quart of scotch.
One quart of rye.
OK, lady, I send 'em right over.
Hey, Baravelli!
What do ya want?
- Watch the door for a few minutes.
And don't let anyone in without the password.
- Swordfish is the password, right?
OK, I got it.
- Well, what is it?
- Password.
Swordfish!
Swordfish. - Alright, swordfish!
- I'm fine. Who are you?
- I'm fine, too.
You need a password.
Well, what is the password?
- Oh no, you gotta tell me.
I tell what I do, I give you three guesses.
It's the name of a fish.
- Is it Mary?
That's no fish! - She isn't?
She drinks like one.
Let me see.
Is it sturgeon?
You crazy!
A sturgeon, he's a doctor, cuts you open when you sick.
You got one more chance.
- I got it.
Haddock.
Funny, I gotta haddock too. - What do you take?
- Sometimes calomel...
I'd walk a mile for a calomel.
- You mean chocolate calomel. Me too.
But you no guess it.
Hey, you no understand English? You only get in if you say swordfish.
Now, I give you one more guess.
- Swordfish... swordfish...
I think I got it.
Is it swordfish? - Ha!
That's it! You guess it!
Pretty good, eh?
- Fine, you guess it...
What do you want?
- To come in.
- Password?
- You don't fool me!
Swordfish.
- No, I got tired of that. I changed it.
What's the password now? - I forgot it.
I better come outside.
Buddy, can you help me out?
I'd like to get a cup of coffee.
Hey, Pinky, do you know the password?
Get up.
That's no way to go into a speakeasy. That's how you come out.
Hey, what'll you have?
He'll take a scotch.
- Right.
I got it!
Swordfish.
- Go outside and see if it works.
Cut the cards.
Now, to business.
I'm looking for two football players who hang around here.
We hang around here...
- That's all I wanna know.
Prof. Wagstaff from Huxley College. - That means nothing to me.
Means nothing to me, either.
I'll try it over again.
I'm Prof. Huxley from Wagstaff College.
You didn't stay at the other one long.
Why don't you pull yourself to pieces?
- I'll talk it over with my partner.
In case I never see you again, what would you want to play football?
First we want a football.
- I don't know if we've got one.
If we had, would you be interested? No rush, you can sleep on it.
I no think I can sleep on a football.
- Who's gonna settle for these drinks?
You're stuck.
- Can you cash a check for $15.22?
Five, ten, fifteen and twenty-two.
As soon as I get the check, I'll send it to ya.
Laura!
- Good morning, Mr. Wagstaff.
Am I too early?
- No, shall I tell Miss Bailey you're here? - No, I will.
Give me the tray.
Would you open the door?
Your breakfast, Madam.
Anything else?
Yes, put some cream in my coffee, and tell me where you've been.
Busy arguing with Dad about you.
Well, what about me?
- Dad wants me to give you up.
You're interfering with my studies.
He must think I'm terrible.
- I think you're wonderful. Beautiful.
Are you making love to me?
"Everyone says I love you, the cop on the corner and the burglar, too, the preacher in the pulpit and the man in the pew, says I love you.
Everyone, no matter who, the folks over 80 and the kid of 2, the captain and the sailor and the rest of the crew, says I love you.
There are only 8 little letters in this phrase, you will find, but they mean a lot more than all the other words combined.
Everywhere the whole world through, the king and the peasant, too, The tiger in the jungle and the monk in the zoo, says I love you."
Get that crate out of here!
You think this is a picnic?
Blocking traffic, holding up cars...
Who do you think you are?
You know what I'm going to do to you?
You're a wise guy, ain't you?
Let go of that club!
You see that badge?
And I say to you, gentlemen, that this college is a failure.
Trouble is we're neglecting football for education. - You are right.
No, I'm wrong.
I was just testing you.
Now I know I'm dealing with a couple of snakes.
There's too much football, and not enough education.
- I think so, too.
Wrong again!
If there was a snake here I'd apologize.
Where would the college be without football?
Have we got a stadium?
- And a college?
Well, we can't support both.
Start tearing down the college.
But where will the students sleep?
- Same as always. In the classroom.
Professor, the Dean of Science wants to know when he'll see you.
He said he's tired of cooling his heels out here.
Tell him I'm cooling a couple of heels in here.
Now, where were we?
Oh yes.
How much am I paying you fellas?
- 5,000. But we haven't been paid.
In that case, I'll raise it to 8,000.
And a bonus, for you and your dog.
The Dean's furious. He's waxing wroth!
Is Wroth there, too? Tell him to wax the Dean for a while.
Guess that's bad, eh? - One more thing, Professor.
It's about your son.
I'm afraid he's paying too little attention to his studies, and too much to Connie Bailey.
I'll put a stop to that.
I'll call her up right now.
Either of you weasels got her number? - No.
- Good thing I have.
Get me Maine 4-9970 and reverse the charges.
Drop this in the mailbox on your way out.
Hello, I want to speak to Miss Bailey.
Is this Miss Bailey?
Why, of course I know your son.
Why, that's silly.
We're just very good friends.
Professor, I don't understand.
You don't?
Come over to my office.
You're in bed?
In that case, I'll come to your office.
Where are your tongs?
Looks like a tong war.
No more ice until you pay the bill.
How much do we owe you?
- $2,000.
- Just for ice?
I can get an Eskimo for $200 and make my own ice.
I tell you what: You owe us 200. We take 2,000 and call it square.
I'll consult my lawyer.
If he tells me to do it, I'll get a new lawyer.
Forget about the money.
Go to college, and get yourself a co-ed.
I gotta co-ed last week for $18, a co-ed with two pairs of pants.
Since when has a co-ed two pairs of pants?
- Since I joined college.
Baravelli, you've got the brain of a 4-year-old boy.
Now that you're a college boy, here's your hat, your pennant, your coat.
Report for football practice in the morning. Now, sign this agreement.
There's nothing on this paper.
- We'll fill in something later.
Here, put your name on there.
Gee, I didn't know you could write.
Wait a minute, this isn't legal.
There's no seal on it.
Where's the seal?
- Where's the seal?
And thus we see that the function of the respiratory system is to transmit oxygen into the bloodstream, which is called osmosis...
Mr President, what a pleasure!
A bicycle, but I left it in the hall.
I brought you two dunces.
Come in, dunces.
Here they are, 10 cents a dunce.
Well, all you need now is a bowl of cherries.
Find yourselves a couple of seats.
Now, let us go on with our lecture.
I wish you'd go on without your lecture.
What do you think of that slide?
- I think he was safe at second.
Now, the circulatory system!
Here is the liver.
What, no bacon?
I'd send that back if I were you.
The liver, if neglected, invariably leads to cirrhosis
You are all familiar with the symptoms of cirrhosis.
So roses are red, so violets are blue, so sugar is sweet, so so are you.
I bet I know who it is.
To protect the heart, or cardium, Mother Nature has provided a sac, called the pericardium. Any questions?
When you gonna cut the watermelon open?
Psychopathically, the duodenum is in inverse ratio to the coordination of the palyphus.
Is this stuff on the level, or are you just making it up as you go along?
Why, everything I told you can be found in the simplest anatomy book.
I'm sure my students will bear me out.
- We'll bear you out.
Let that be a lesson to all of you.
This school will be here long after you're gone.
That goes for you, too.
Leave me alone!
Let us follow a corpuscle on its journey.
Oh, my mistake, I thought I was a corpuscle.
There is constant warfare between the red and white corpuscles.
Now, baboons, what is a corpuscle? - That's easy.
There's a captain, then a lieutenant, then there's a corpuscle.
Why don't you bore a hole in yourself and let the sap run out.
We now find ourselves among the Alps, simple people who eat rice and shoes.
Beyond are more Alps, and the Lord Alps those who Alp themselves.
The blood rushes from the head to the feet, gets a look at those feet, and rushes back to the head again.
This is known as auction pinochle.
We first listen to your hearts beat, and if your hearts beat anything but diamonds and clubs, your partner is cheating. Or your wife.
Now take this point, for instance...
That reminds me. Where's my son?
Well, the human body takes many strange forms.
Now, here is a most unusual organ.
The organ will play a solo immediately after the feature picture.
Scientists examine rats, or your landlord who won't cut the rent.
And what do they find?
Asparagus.
Now, on closer examination...
This needs closer examination.
In fact, it needs a nightgown.
Baravelli, who did this?
Is this your picture?
It doesn't look like me.
- Well, take it away and hang it in my bedroom.
Now, who did it?
So you're the culprit.
Young man, you can't burn the candle at both ends.
Well, I was wrong. I thought it was a candle.
Well, you must be punished.
You stay after school.
But I didn't do anything.
I know, but there's no fun keeping him after school.
Now, we'll have no more interruptions.
According to von Steinmetz, the eminent physiologist, a group of phagocytes...
According to von Steinmetz, the eminent physiologist, a group of er, phagocytes...
According to von...
According to von Steinmetz...
According to von Steinmetz, a group of white phagocytes is present.
And they are essential to prolonging life.
My left wing has been turned, my rear end has been cut off.
But I'll fight it out on these lines...
They got me!
Oh, it's you, Frank.
Why, of course, I'd love to have you come over.
Alright, I'll be expecting you then.
Goodbye, darling.
Who are you calling "darling"?
- Frank Wagstaff, the professor's son.
I didn't tell you to fall for him, just to find out about his team.
He says Huxley will win.
I've got my bankroll bet on Darwin, and I'm taking no chances.
Before the game starts I'll have the Huxley signals.
Down the hatch and on my way.
See you later.
Bye, dear.
Are you still here.
- I just came in.
What do you mean, am I still here?
- I mean, are you hear already?
The old man gave me a terrible bawling out.
Don't worry about him, he'll never know you were here.
How about a little drink?
- Alright, I'll get you one.
- Please!
Are you Miss Bailey?
Come, come, one of us is!
- I'm Miss Bailey, and who are you?
I'm Prof. Wagstoff.
- Miss Bailey!
Then you are Miss Bailey.
Thought you could fool me.
You've got to give my son up.
- Give him up?
He's all I've got, apart from a picture of George Washington.
But... - Lies!
He's a shell of his former self, which nobody can deny.
I tell you you're ruining him.
Did he tell you that you have beautiful eyes?
- Why, yes.
I could sit on your lap all day if you didn't stand up.
Quick, get out!
That door.
I don't want any ice.
- The ice man.
- You can't pull the wool over my ice.
The ice man leaves me cold.
Here you are...
- So, I caught you at last.
You are fooling around with her.
Oh, the shame of it.
A son taking a dame from his father.
- Enough, get out of here!
I'll settle with this woman, then we'll have you to dinner.
Let's go.
Follow me.
Be a lamp in the window for my wandering boy.
Where were we?
Oh yes, I was on your lap.
And doing pretty well, as I recall it.
Hurry, get out!
And remember, stay undercover.
- I've more students in the college.
You dropped your ice.
I don't want any ice!
Now do you want any ice?
Oh, you're beautiful.
You're overcoming me.
- Thanks for reminding me.
You got something.
I'm gonna tell him he's crazy.
Professor, what are you doing here?
Nothing, since you came in.
You know him?
- He put me on the football team.
Now I just have to get him off the couch.
Read any good books lately?
This must be the main highway.
Follow me, I've been doing this all day.
Pretty popular place.
- Yeah, a hot dog stand would clean up.
What are you doing here?
- Me? I'm the music teacher.
- Since you came in.
- I'm the plumber.
In case something goes wrong with her pipes.
I haven't used that joke for 20 years.
Take a deep breath and follow me.
Cosy place we have here.
You sing high, eh?
- I have a falsetto voice.
My last pupil, she gotta false set of teeth.
So maybe it's better you don't sing.
That's much better.
I'll sing.
"Everyone says I love you, the big mosquito when he sting you, the fly when he's stuck on the fly paper, too, says I love you.
Every time the cow says "moo", she's making the bull very happy too, and the rooster when he holler cock-a-doodly-doo, says I love you.
Christopher Columbo, he write the Queen of Spain a nice little note, he say how I love you, then he get a great big boat. He's a wise guy.
What you think Columbo do, when he's coming here in 1492,
He says to Pocahontas, atch-a catchy coo, which means I love you!"
Maybe it's better I don't sing, too. - Yes.
- Alright, I'll play.
I love good music.
- So do I, let's get out of here.
- Sit down.
I've got to stay here.
But you folks can go into the lobby till it's over.
Well, that's all for the first lesson.
Next week I teach you how to breathe. Don't breathe before then.
If this is a singing lesson, I'm a ring-tailed monkey.
Keep your family out of it.
- What?
Are you going my way?
- Then I'm staying here.
No you don't.
And if I find you here again, it'll be curtains.
Tell my son to take that lamp down.
You've got the wrong football players.
- The whole team?
No, Baravelli and the dog catcher.
But I got them in the speakeasy.
- You got the wrong ones.
The ones I told you about are playing for Darwin.
- Send for Baravelli.
Don't leave a stone unturned. He's probably under one.
...2671, 57, 84, 59, 71...
What are you doing in there?
- I'm practising secret signals.
Come on out.
- You can fix it for our team to win. - Oh no,
- Alright, but listen.
I want two Darwin players kidnapped.
Have you any experience in kidnapping?
- You bet. You know what I do?
First I call them up, then I send them my chauffeur.
What kind of a car you got?
I no got a car, just a chauffeur.
But when you have a chauffeur, aren't you supposed to have a car?
Well, I had, but it cost too much, so I sold the car.
I would have kept the car.
I gotta have a chauffeur to take me to work in the morning.
How can he take you to work?
He don't have to. I no gotta job.
How much would you want to stand in front of a firing squad?
Now just a minute, boys.
I didn't come here to fight.
You have to, I've taken my coat off.
- I wanna talk to Baravelli.
You wouldn't mind stepping out?
I'd love to, but I have to see the girl first.
I've got a proposition.
- Watch out, he's nearly as crooked as you.
Let's go in here.
I want you to do something for me.
- I'm busy.
We gotta kidnap a couple of players from the Darwin team.
You don't mean McHardie and Mullen?
Sounds like it.
But the fellas I mean are Mullen and McHardie.
Let me give you a tip.
The boys live at 39 Hanley Street.
Thanks!
- Now, I want you to do something for me.
- Listen, give me the signals, and this 500 bucks is yours.
Here's the signals.
Want a minute, these are Darwin's signals.
They cost me 200.
I gotta make a little profit.
Listen, you gotta get busy and get those football signals.
I thought you were going to get them.
- I wouldn't be asking you then.
You just have to get to the professor. He's got the Huxley signals.
And I'm depending on you to get them.
Yes, but how?
- You know how.
Romance him, baby, romance him.
And remember, all you're to get is the football signals.
"Everyone says I love you, but just what they say it for, I never knew, it's just inviting trouble for the poor sucker who says I love you.
Take a pair of rabbits who get stuck on each other and begin to woo, and pretty soon you find a million more rabbits who say I love you.
When a lion gets feeling frisky and begins to roar, there's another lion who knows just what he's roaring for.
Everything that ever grew, the goose and the gander and the gosling too, the duck upon the water, when he feels that way too, says..."
That's a wise quack.
You keep your bill out of this.
How would you like it if I butted into your affairs?
This is my first time in a canoe since I saw "The American Tragedy."
You're perfectly safe, Professor, in this boat.
I was going to get a flat bottom, but the boat girl didn't have one.
I could go on like this drifting and dreaming for ever.
What a day. Spring in the air!
Who, me? And fall in the lake?
Professor, you're full of whimsy.
Can you tell from there?
I'm always like that after radishes.
Is that important?
- Is it important?
Those are the football signals.
I've got a duplicate in my pocket.
I always carry two of everything.
This is my first date with one woman.
You mean you take two girls out every time?
I hate to see a girl walk home alone.
You know, Professor, I've never seen football signals.
You think a little girl like me could understand them?
I think you could understand anything.
Is the big stwong man gonna show liddle icky baby all about the bad football signals?
Was that you or the duck?
If it was you, I'm with the duck.
If icky baby don't learn about the football signals, icky baby gonna cry.
If icky girl keep talking that way, big stwong man gonna kick all her teef in.
Naughty man is only fooling!
Just for that I'm coming over to smother him in kisses.
- You couldn't make that onions?
Oh, so that's your game.
Professor Wagstaff!
Just call me Quincy.
And later you can call me Quince.
Throw me the lifesaver!
Please hurry, Professor.
39.
This is it!
Yeah, this is McHardie.
So they're coming right over?
OK, we'll take care of them.
Jennings says Baravelli and the dog catcher are coming to kidnap us to keep us out of the game.
This is the place.
Now how we gonna catch 'em?
No, that's for flies.
Baseball players catch flies.
We look for football players.
You bring the tools?
You got the shovel, the axe and the pick?
Where's the pick?
No, that's no pick. That's a hog.
Don't you know what a hog is?
Oh, come on, let's get busy.
We gotta kidnap those players.
Mullen und McHardie?
What can we do for you?
- You got a brother?
- You got a sister?
She's a very sick man.
You better come with us.
What happened to her?
She crash her automobile.
She has no automobile.
- Then she fell off a horse. We drive you there.
You will?
I have no sister.
That's alright.
We gotta no car. Come on.
You think you're gonna take us for a ride?
This is gonna take a long time.
Try one at a time.
Didn't work, eh?
Get tough.
Get tough with the other one.
Get tough with both of them.
Tougher!
Now you're getting someplace.
You better think of something else.
I'm exhausted, too.
Maybe you fellas got an idea?
- I'll say we do.
Where's that rope, Ed?
Get 'em, Ed!
Hey guys, we'll let you know how the game comes out.
Now they've kidnapped us!
That's a fix-a fine we're in.
How we gonna get out?
I got an idea.
You got a rope?
Tie on the bed, throw the rope out the window.
Tie on the bed, throw the rope out the window.
What you do? You no tie on the bed.
No, I mean a-tie the rope.
Now what you gonna do?
You crazy!
That's a-no good. How we gonna get out?
You wanna break-a my neck?
Don't worry, Mr. Jennings, everything's working out fine.
That game's in the bag.
Wonder what the two mugs are doing up there?
Our little playmates, just in time for a cup of tea.
We got no cups. See ya after the game. Come on, Pinky.
- No yuh don't!
Take off your coat.
Come on. Off with your shirt.
Quit stallin'
Now take off your pants.
- I got a date, nothing doing.
Take that coat off.
Stand over there, you.
Come on, Ed, let's take their clothes.
So, if you boys'll excuse us, we'll run along and play football.
Tune in on the radio if you want to know how the game's going.
I'll send my sister over to keep you company.
Gee, I guess it's locked.
Boy, what a pretty play.
Darwin's just got a fourth touchdown and the crowd is going wild.
There seems to be no stopping Mullen and McHardie.
Two minutes left to play in the first quarter, and what a lacing the Huxley team is getting.
HcHardie has the ball and he's breaking through.
I guess we made a grand slam.
Pinky, hurry up.
Come on, we still got time to play.
Fine kidnappers you are.
The fellas you kidnapped were here before you.
Look: 12 to nothing. Fat lot you care.
Know what it means if Huxley loses?
Shame, disgrace, humiliation!
And you're crazy if you don't play the ace.
Come on, fight!
No, no, no, no!
Get in that game!
Listen, you butter-fingered milksops!
The way you're playing, you couldn't beat a girls' basketball team.
We're going to have to use our star play No. 37, where the quarterback makes a lateral pass to the right guard...
- Wait a minute!
Boys, if you can't beat that bunch of...
- What do you want?
- You're talking to the wrong team.
I know I am, but our team wouldn't listen to me.
Which way you going?
- Out there.
- Drop me off at the 40-yard line.
Where's your number?
Boy, play like you did last time.
I bet five dollars on the other team.
- OK.
Here comes Prof. Wagstaff.
Will you say something?
- I will if you get up.
Professor Wagstaff will tell you all about the game.
Some football game. I wish you were here.
Instead of me.
Last week, I told you Mrs. Moskowitz was expecting a blessed event.
Last night Mrs Moskowitz had twins.
OK, Mr. Moskowitz!
Thank you, Professor.
- It was nothing at all.
The boys are back in the field, they're lined up,
Huxley is about to kick off, and there they go!
Pardon me.
That'll teach him to pass a lady without tipping his hat.
Hey, you wanna get hurt?
We're gonna throw a forward pass.
Signal: 18, 72, forward pass, eenie, meenie, miney, mo.
Pinky, what are you doing here?
That tackle will cost you 15 yards.
You're supposed to tackle the man with the ball, understand?
Hey, idiot, where's that ball?
Look, he's got the mumps.
- Give me that ball.
Give me it.
Ain't deaf over there.
- Signal: 18, 42, 56 and run. Hup!
Bring that back!
Signal: 85, 29, 78.
Hup!
Come on, boys.
Jumping anaconda!
Is there a doctor in the stands?
Yes, I'm a doctor.
- How do you like the game, doc?
Come back for me in five minutes.
Fancy seeing you here.
It's a small world after all.
Why weren't you in the last scrimmage?
I'm sitting this one out.
- What are you doing with that cigar?
You know another way to smoke it?
- Get on your feet.
Don't look now, but I think I see the chemistry prof. Up there with the janitor's wife.
Here, have a cigar.
Signal.
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Professor Wagstaff gets the ball.
Have you got it, boys?
- OK!
Hey, bring that ball in here.
There goes the ball.
Go on, Pinky.
Make a home run.
Gee, Pinky, you made a touchdown.
That's marvellous.
I forgot your phone number.
- Where's that ball?
Here it is.
Come on, get off that ball.
You're holding up the game.
Signal: Uno, duo, tre, vendi, this-a time we go left endl.
Nice work, Pinky.
Hi diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle, this time I think we go through the middle.
Hey, you're running the wrong way.
We are gathered together here to join this man and this woman in matrimony.
Do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Make it a certified check for $183.28.
$183.28?
And make it payable to the Hartford Wholesale Produce Company.
The Hartford Wholesale Produce Company.
Shoot that down to Ruth, Fred.
For Ruth.
Hey, forward pass, frog face.
My check book positively says $11.21.
You know what happens?
This check gets thrown back in my lap.
For five years I do business here, and now I should get insulted?
You didn't make any checking deposit last Saturday, only savings.
Is that so?
Well, I'm laughing.
I was telling Mrs. Ginsberg this morning that someday I'll be a millionaire like this Romer Sheffield.
Goodbye, Mr. Ginsberg.
Oh, have a heart, Ruth.
I get no pleasure out of life.
For the fifth time, no.
Just you and me alone.
I thought that was coming.
Well, why not?
One session of your football technique lasts a lifetime.
You might as well give up, frog face.
I'm going to ask Ruth out this Saturday myself.
Any fleas?
Back in your cage, gorilla!
The girls fluttered when he asked them to dance.
Scram, rube.
How about it, baby?
You take a lot for granted.
It takes a lot to satisfy me.
Shall we make a hot Saturday of it?
Well, that depends upon the degree of heat.
You can run the temperature.
The whole crowd's going out to Willow Springs.
I'd be bored to death staying in town.
There you are, Eva.
Now, run along and drive your Aunt Minnie around for her shopping.
Of course, Father.
Thanks a lot.
All right.
Father, may I have the car tonight and Saturday night?
It doesn't seem proper for you to take the car out at night so much.
It may lead to undesirable...
Why, Father.
Undesirable gossip.
It's indiscreet.
You know I'd never do anything unbecoming.
No, no, no, of course I...
Well, I guess it'll be all right.
Thanks, dear. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Hey, Eva!
Hello, Archie. What's on your mind?
Well, look, Eva.
Conny's taking Ruth Saturday, isn't he?
So what?
Well, how about you going with me?
It's a date.
Oh, that's swell.
You haven't been out with me for a month.
Saturday after lunch.
Dad's giving me the closed car.
Better yet.
My feet get cold when I park in those roadsters.
Hey, hey.
And I said to the Reverend Botts that I...
Hello, Eva.
How are you, dear?
And I told the Reverend Botts that I thought the City Council should call on that Romer Sheffield and demand that he leave town.
The idea of bringing her out here to his summer home and living with her openly!
It's a disgrace to the community.
You're absolutely right.
He's a vile influence, too.
Romer, look.
Well, we must be going.
Bye.
I'll only be a minute, Camille. All right.
Good morning, Mr. Sheffield.
Hello, Conny, how are you?
Just fine, thank you.
I'm pretty busy.
Then the bank's still solvent, eh?
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Smith.
I rechecked your statement personally.
The balance is correct.
Good morning, Miss Brock.
Oh, good morning.
Perhaps you failed to deduct the government tax.
Yes, there's a two cent tax on every check you write.
Oh, no, no, not just for Democrats, the Republicans have to pay it, too.
Goodbye, Mr. Smith.
What can I do for you, Mr. Sheffield?
Just talk to me, will you?
I like to hear you talk.
I haven't time.
Yes. I've noticed that.
Somehow, every time I come into the bank you always manage to be busy.
You know, I think I'll phone next time.
Phone?
Well, you seemed pretty patient with Mr. Smith.
Did you ever talk to Mr. Smith? No.
I imagine it must be quite an experience.
You know, I like your hair done that way.
It's very becoming.
Did you have any business to transact?
Come to think of it, I did.
Look, I want this check deposited.
$30,000.
Checking or savings?
Checking, by all means.
Third window down.
Mr. Billings.
Look, Miss Brock, don't you think you could take personal charge of my account?
Well, I'd have an excuse to become better acquainted with you.
Second, I've already mentioned your hair.
Third, you have blue eyes.
Fourth...
Is this an inventory?
Now, look, I'm serious.
Let me go on, won't you?
I'm more interesting when I'm serious.
You're considered much too dangerous for local consumption.
Ruled out, eh? Uh-huh.
Well, well, Conny Billop seems more fortunate.
Oh, I imagine he'd change places with you most anytime.
Incidentally, it looks as though there's a man wanted.
She's glaring in here and thumping her compact on top of the car door, isn't she?
You know, the enamel's getting all worn off there.
I guess I'll have to go and see what I can do about it.
Say, what's the matter?
Does everyone in this town have high blood pressure?
Well, how was she today?
Purely business, my dear.
Oh, yes?
Selling short or bulling the market?
I suggest we stop talking about Wall Street, huh?
If you think you can park me out here while you go in there and flirt with some dizzy little bank clerk, you're crazy!
All right, I'm crazy. Oh!
Did she catch the train all right?
Good. Any parting message?
She said you could go to the devil.
Well, that's nice of her.
Thank you, sir.
Don't mention it.
Did she say anything else?
She said she was going to Florida on Mr. Howard's yacht.
She'll probably get a nice coat of tan.
That'll be all, Frank.
Nine, nine, four.
Boy, I don't know my own strength.
Yeah, he's here.
For you, Conny.
Hey, keep your eye on him, will you?
I don't want him pushing them in with his hand.
Oh, hello, Mr. Sheffield.
Yeah, that landlady usually knows where everybody is.
Say, Conny, I've noticed your crowd goes out to Willow Springs every Saturday.
Yeah, that's the only excitement there is around this burg.
Well, why don't you all drop in here Saturday afternoon?
There's lots of drinks, and I'll rummage up some food.
Say, that'd be swell.
You bet I'll invite them.
Then I'll expect you.
Stay as long as you like. No limit.
Boy, this Saturday is going to be some Saturday!
What's up?
That was Romer Sheffield.
Wanted me to invite the crowd out to his place for a party.
Well, we can't go out there.
The town would burn down to the ground if we took the girls within a mile of that guy.
Stop griping.
Nobody needs to see where we're going.
We can take the side road up Willow Creek into his place.
Well, how about the girls?
Do you think they'll go?
They'll eat it up.
Yeah, I know, but...
Listen, Archie.
You start griping every week about spending three bucks for bootleg gin.
Here you got a swell chance to get some real liquor for nothing.
Say, that is an idea, isn't it?
Be out in a minute.
I'll give you odds it's 15 minutes.
Fifty cents to a dollar. Taken.
Hello, Dad.
Hello, Ruth.
I'd forgotten it was Saturday.
Until you saw this pay envelope, eh?
Well, what is it this time?
Well, to tell the truth, an unusual thing happened this morning.
I found that I'd run out of cigars.
You better start smoking cigarettes.
Ruth, your mother's on the warpath.
Ruth!
Hello, Mother.
There's moths in this house again.
I want you to change your dress and go up to the attic right away and get them blankets out of the trunk and hang them in the sun.
And you'd better look after the winter clothes, too.
Mother, I can't, not now.
I promised to go out with the crowd.
Well, that's no excuse when there's work to be done.
Well, I didn't intend it as an excuse.
You know Saturday is the only time I ever get to go anywhere.
I can think of lots better ways of spending it than dancing and flirting till all hours of the night with a lot of good-for-nothing young puppies.
Well, I can't.
Not in this town.
You mark my words, young lady, you'll live to regret it, and you won't get any sympathy from me, either.
Iceman!
You don't have to tell me.
We owe him $3.43.
And the milk company called up today.
Yes, Mother, I know.
Where's the rest of it?
I gave $2 to father.
Oh, you did?
Harry!
Iceman!
Stop yelling like that or you won't get a nickel!
Hello, Sis.
What were you doing in my bureau?
Why, I wasn't anywhere near it.
Where's that new pair of shorts I just bought?
New shorts?
No, I haven't seen them.
Hey, let go of me!
What's the idea?
Bottoms up, Mrs. Van Astorbilt.
I didn't mean it.
Have a heart, will you, Sis?
A brief pull, and then silence.
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it.
None the worse for wear.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.
Nobody wears them nowadays anyhow!
Good afternoon, Senator.
Have a cigar. Thank you.
Any mail from the Administration?
No, just a letter from Chicago.
That's funny. I wrote Herbert last week about that river project.
Well, he may write to you next week.
He'll probably telegraph.
That's very possible.
Have a cigar, Conny. Thanks.
Thanks again, Senator.
Don't mention it.
You know, this public life is very strenuous.
No wonder you smoke so many cigars.
Well, friends, you know.
Twelve minutes.
Pay up, Conny.
Right you are.
Here.
Here you are, Dad.
Better lay in a fresh supply.
The chances are in our favor.
Tell Mother I'll murder the moths tomorrow.
Say, Ida!
Where's that $2?
Wait till you hear this, Ida.
Who do you think's getting here on the 5:15?
Bill Fadden.
He is?
"Looking forward to seeing the old stamping ground again."
"Going to camp on you Saturday night unless you lock me out."
"I imagine seven years have changed Ruth a lot,"
"but somehow I still expect to find her in pigtails.
Regards, Bill."
Isn't that just like Bill?
I wonder if he's changed much.
It'll be fine to see him again.
I just wish Ruth had more friends like Bill.
Wealthy, good family, and he's got a fine position, too. Mmm-hmm.
Ruthie!
Ruthie! She's gone already.
She would be!
Well, she can see Bill tomorrow.
That's it, go right ahead and stick up for her.
Where's that $2?
Well, I'll need that, you know, to entertain Bill.
Well, I swan!
Far, far away.
One minute more.
Come on, babies, bite!
Don't you recognize caviar when you see it?
Have another, won't you?
Yay, the visiting firemen!
Park it in the bushes.
Hey, hide it behind the house.
Go lay an egg!
I haven't got the strength.
I'll go park the bus.
You seem to have a party going on, Mr. Sheffield.
Yes, so they tell me.
Now, look, would you mind if I do you a great favor?
Yes, but go on.
Well, if you'll use the word "Romer" instead of "Mr. Sheffield," I'll promise to call you "Ruth."
I'm overcome!
Splendid! Then you need a drink.
How cute!
I'll take vanilla.
Well, vanilla it shall be, lady.
Don't tell...
Hello, everybody.
Hello, Conny.
Here you are. Thanks for organizing the party.
Why, it was no effort at all.
They could hardly wait till Saturday.
One vanilla coming up with courtly gesture, lady.
Say, this is great stuff.
Bottled in Bond, I bet.
Glad you like it, Conny.
There's a lot more.
I'm afraid you won't be saying that by nightfall.
She isn't making much of a play for Romer.
Well, it looks like he's enjoying it.
Probably enjoyed that Renault girl, too.
Hey, One Lung.
Bringy two drinky, very tall, savvy?
What will it be, gentlemen, Scotch, Bourbon or Cognac?
Two Cognacs.
Hello, Eve, have a drink?
How they going?
Not fast enough to keep me from dancing with you.
Let's make it later, Eve.
Ruth is waiting.
Let Ruth entertain Romer for a few minutes.
You didn't bring us here to high-hat us, did you?
Don't look at it that way, Eve.
Sure, I wanna dance with you, but...
Well, now's your chance.
I've been wanting to thank you for having Romer invite us here.
I thought Archie said you were shocked.
Well, I didn't know it was going to be like this.
Well, what do you say?
That's your boat, isn't it?
Frank's been taking some of the crowd for a ride.
Like to go down and watch them?
Yes, I'd love to.
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's walk along the shore.
There are lots of lovely rocks and nice little mud puddles.
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
You must be looking for work.
Ah, lady, lady, will you give me a job?
I haven't had work since...
Since Camille left town?
Hey, Joe, where's Ruth?
She went somewhere with Romer.
He's got a crust dragging her away from the party.
Don't be a chump all your life.
She probably did the dragging.
She'd ditch you any day for Romer.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'll find out when they get back.
Lovely back, darling.
Pleasant here, isn't it?
It would have been a shame for you to have missed it.
I'd begun to think you weren't coming to the party.
Well, I've begun to think I didn't.
There, now, you see, we'll have to start all over again.
Pleasant here, isn't it? Mmm-hmm.
How are your folks?
Father, smoking.
Mother, fuming.
Worried about you? About me?
Of course not.
No, I'm supposed to be murdering moths.
Mother hates for me not to.
What a wise mother.
She knows what the moths do when the flame is away.
Does she know you're with me?
I'm with Conny.
Didn't you know?
Well, all's fair, you know.
Why, I'd murder just to see the soft green shadows through that pine tree on your lovely hair.
A girl's pretty helpless alone with you.
Nothing to resent but compliments, and they're said to paralyze a lady.
You know, your hair is like the sun glowing on the waters.
And your eyes are like the evening skies that send their first stars down to lovers.
Your lovely arms...
Isn't this one feeling just a little paralyzed?
Goodness me, Mr. Sheffield, yes, but I recover just like that!
I think I'm able to be up and about.
In fact, I'd like a wee cocktail.
Please don't go so soon.
Well, a girl can't go on forever calling her little policemen.
All right, I'll promise, so help me, to be good.
But there's the most divine little spot further along the shore.
Let me show you it, will you?
Promise I can have it without a stroke of paralysis?
Yes, you can see it without a stroke of any kind.
Come on, be a good winner.
I can't resist you, except when you're dangerous.
Hello, Conny.
Well, it's about time you're getting back.
I'm terribly sorry, Conny.
I guess it's entirely my fault.
Yeah, I thought it would be.
Yes. Well, you see, we got to talking about mutual friends.
Say, Conny, did you ever read Alice in Wonderland?
Say, what are you trying to do, kid me?
Hey, shake a leg!
See you over there.
Don't fail us, Romer.
Has everyone gone?
Nearly everyone.
They're over at the Springs.
Gee, I'm sorry they broke up so early.
They all want you to come over there.
No, I don't think I will.
Thanks awfully, Conny.
Make it snappy, Ruth.
I'll go get the car.
I'm sorry Conny acted that way.
I don't blame him.
Archie!
Look, I can't join the crowd over at the Springs, but would you mind taking these two quarts over with my compliments?
Well, I gotta get the car.
Gee, thanks a lot, Romer.
It was swell.
So long, Ruth.
That was awfully decent of you, Romer.
Sometimes I surprise myself, really.
So you finally got back.
You sound surprised.
Did you expect me to be gone all night?
Well, dear, I didn't know.
You see, a girl in your position can afford to be so much more unconventional in her pleasures than I could.
What's the matter?
I didn't say anything.
I know you didn't.
Then why did you tell me to shut up?
Well, how do you like my guest room?
Light, airy, comfortable and modern.
Why look further?
I wouldn't be interested in a short-term lease.
Goodbye, Romer.
Well, this is once you didn't keep me waiting.
I didn't dare.
Open all the windows Turn the fan on, too.
I'm ablaze, I'm in a daze I'm burning for you.
Call the fire engine And the whole darn crew.
Tell them all to hurry 'Cause I'm burning for you.
I try to cool off But when you say no.
I'm a volcano What can I do.
Would you let me smother Leave me in a stew.
Go on and tell your mother That I'm burning for you.
Open all the windows Turn that fan on, too.
Call that fire engine And the whole darn crew.
Let's grab a boat and cool off, or have you run away from the crowd enough for one day?
Conny, why do you keep harping on that?
You know I'd love to go out on the lake.
Let's get out before somebody else horns in on the ride.
Conny's a fool.
Why? Letting Ruth drag him off outside just like the rest of the fellows that chase her.
He's no fool.
Enjoy your ride? It was great.
It's much nicer out here.
I'll say it is.
Let's have one of your best putt-putts.
This is it.
Hop right in, beautiful, and pick yourself a nice, soft seat.
Okay.
Please don't, Conny.
Come on, you're too far away.
No, I'm all right where I am.
Can't you ever enjoy a boat ride without kissing somebody?
Pretty cove.
What's the idea?
You're not going to high-hat me all day, are you?
Conny, be your age!
You know I don't like that caveman stuff.
You'll love it, beautiful.
I came out here to cool off, not to have a wrestling match.
You like Romer's petting better than mine, huh?
I don't like the way your ears are put on.
Let's go back.
And make a sap out of me twice in one day?
Nothing doing.
I've got a little coming to me.
What do you expect for a boat ride, Marlene Dietrich?
Don't play dumb. You've been on these parties before.
Conny!
Good night, Eva.
Good night.
Good night, Archie.
Eva, Conny isn't back yet.
Did you ever know Ruth to bring a fellow back this early?
Oh, Archie!
Why, hello, Ruth.
Here, take this cushion.
I'm too tired to move.
I suppose you're wondering why I'm here.
Well, you're here.
I can't think of anything more important.
Ruth!
Would it interest you to know that I've wanted you ever since I first saw you in the bank?
You're supposed to see things you want in banks.
Yes, and the moment you go to get them, burglar alarms start ringing all over town.
May I pay you a compliment?
No, no, not one of those haymakers.
It's just this.
I've known many women.
Never have I met one so warm, so desirable and so unapproachable.
You know, I surprise myself admiring the mind in you.
You don't mind my mentioning it since it's there, do you?
No.
As a matter of fact, it all comes down to this, a man would have to be very stupid to touch you without first knowing your heart.
There, you didn't think brains could do that for you, did you?
I hadn't given it much thought.
Is Listerine good for brains?
Love, they tell me, is better.
If it lasts.
Well, what does it matter, so long as one finds happiness?
Did you ever regret being happy?
No, but I would if that happiness meant being sneered at and scorned and talked about.
You don't know what it is to live in a small town.
You can only play on the surface.
And even if you're honest about that, you're not safe from a lot of evil-minded people.
The only security in a place like this is settling down and getting married.
Marriage, ownership.
Dreadful thought, isn't it?
One drink for Sheffield!
Say, tell me something.
How can you be so morbid after what happened last night?
What about last night?
Well, for heaven's sake, girl, don't you remember where you were?
I was home in bed, asleep at 10:00.
No, no, no, there must be some mistake.
You and I were in Venice.
And our rooms opened onto the Gardens and the Grand Canal.
And we watched the moon play across the walls, and listened to that gondolier singing as he paddled down the canal.
Romer, a check of yours for $10,000 came into the bank today, made out to Camille Renault.
It was torn.
You wanted us to put it through, didn't you?
You know, Ruth, you're strangely honest, sometimes painfully so.
Will you make me a promise?
What is it?
Well, if ever you find out you're wrong about what you think is security and happiness, would you let me know?
Even if I'm in Switzerland, will you send me a cablegram?
Well, I'm not wrong, but I'll promise.
Let's drink to it.
To what?
To your being wrong. No, thank you!
Somebody's coming.
Sit still.
It's just a car passing.
Hello, Conny, I couldn't imagine who it was.
Yeah, I'll bet you couldn't.
Where's Ruth?
Why, hasn't she been with you?
Quit stalling.
Now, who was the girl I just saw go in the house?
You know, Conny, you seem to have an amazing curiosity.
Yeah, enough to find out if that was Ruth.
Don't you think it's more agreeable here on the veranda?
No, I don't!
I suppose those aren't Ruth's shoes, huh?
Conny, I think you ought to go into town.
Well, Ruth's going with me, you big stiff!
You know, it's much cooler in town.
You'll remember this!
I always remember pleasant experiences.
The young lady has gone, sir.
She told Frank you wished him to drive her home.
Wait a minute!
You forgot these.
Good night.
Let me out at this corner.
So she ditched Conny again and went back to see Romer.
Yeah, it sure looks like it.
And afterward he sends her into town in his car.
Why didn't she stay all night?
Hot potatoes!
Bill Fadden!
I can hardly believe it's you!
It is. Are you sure?
Haven't changed a bit.
Where are your pigtails?
Well, a girl has to grow up and bob her hair sometime.
Well, go on, eat your pie and tell me all about it.
What are you doing here, and why?
I've got to do a geological survey for the oil company.
Up around Black Mountain.
I wanna pitch camp in the old Indian cave. Oh.
So you turned out to be a geologist.
Yeah, anticlines, fossils, sedimentary deposits and all.
Sounds awful!
It's a great game, Ruth, I'm out in the field 10 months a year.
Are you still afraid of girls?
I'm not very used to them.
Never see any from one month to another.
And couldn't figure them out if you did.
Well, anyway, I...
I wanted to see you again, a lot.
Did you have a good time tonight?
Great.
Your father told me they've built a new dance hall right down on the lakefront.
Willow Grove, or something.
Yes.
Now, that's too bad.
I guess the lake isn't the same anymore.
The same?
I was just remembering how peaceful it used to be.
I guess you'd find it changed, all right.
Good night. See you in the morning.
See you at breakfast.
How about a date this afternoon?
Why don't you call up Ruth?
She ought to be very interesting now.
I'm fed up with her!
Because she ran out on you again last night?
Well, how did you know?
Because I saw her coming home in Romer Sheffield's car.
You did, huh?
About 2:30 this morning.
Ruth Brock?
What time did she leave you?
Why, when we left the dance. She ducked while I went out to get a boat.
Why, that was only about 10:00. Didn't she even go out in the boat with you?
Well, if she had, she would have come back with me, wouldn't she?
Then she must have been at Sheffield's house for more than four hours.
How awful!
All right, Conny.
Come out about 2:30 this afternoon.
Yes. Goodbye.
Do you mean to say that you actually saw Ruth Brock in Romer Sheffield's car?
Yes, Auntie.
Isn't it terrible?
Why, she must have been at his house for more than four hours.
I didn't think Ruth was that kind of a girl.
I've seen it coming for a long time.
She's always been encouraging men.
Number, please.
Hello.
Hello.
Matilda? Matilda, I've just heard the most awful news.
Ruth Brock was in Romer Sheffield's house with him alone last night.
Yes, yes, from about 10:00 until 2:30.
And then he sent her home to town in his car.
Number, please. Number, please.
An affair with Romer Sheffield. Yes, yes.
I'll call you back later.
Yes, someone saw them silhouetted against the curtain of the upstairs bedroom.
He was holding her in his arms.
Yes, she was there till 3:30.
She spent the night with him.
They saw her coming into town this morning in his car, just at dawn.
How long are you going to be gone, Bill?
About a week.
I want to make some pictures and maps and get some rock specimens.
I wish you didn't have to go so soon.
It's probably just as well.
If I didn't, I think I'd find myself falling in love with you again.
Again?
When we were kids, I used to think you were swell. In spite of the pigtails.
But now you know better, don't you?
I'm beginning to doubt it.
I never forgot you.
I've always remembered you, too, Bill.
But memories can't turn to love in one day.
All ready, Mr. Fadden.
Right with you.
Wish you could drive up and spend an afternoon exploring with me.
Around Black Mountain with compass and camera.
That's about it.
Do you think you could?
Bill, I'm a working girl. But I may be able to get a day off.
I hope so.
Headquarters, the cave.
Goodbye, Bill.
Yes, indeed, and I believe every word of it.
There isn't a doubt.
Mrs. Winchell, Mrs. Starr, how do you do?
Hello, Ruth, darling.
Miss Brock, I've decided to dispense with your services.
I'm giving you two weeks' salary in place of notice.
But why, Mr. Randolph?
There isn't enough work for Mr. Franklin to need you any longer.
That's not the reason, Mr. Randolph.
I've had plenty of work to do.
I don't care to argue the matter with you, Miss Brock, except to say that the moral conduct of our employees is a very important consideration.
That's all, Miss Brock.
Hello, Ruth.
Where's Mother?
Out somewhere.
Why, what's the matter, honey?
I just got fired.
What for?
Well, it seems I'm an immoral woman, and immoral women shouldn't work in banks, you know.
They might corrupt the young dollar bills.
Did Ned Randolph call you that?
What are you going to do?
I'm going to make him eat every word of it.
The lying, ungrateful dog!
I gave him his...
No, no, Dad, it wouldn't be any use.
So you got yourself fired from the bank and came sneaking home.
Bad news sure travels fast.
Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Mother, I didn't do anything to...
Don't you stand there and lie to me.
Why, the whole town's talking about you and sneering at you.
I might have known you'd do something to disgrace the family. Painting your face and staying out nights with a lot of rotten young whelps!
You would end up in a vile affair with Romer Sheffield.
Why, Mother, how can you say such a...
Ida, that's a lie!
Well, ask her.
Weren't you alone in his house with him at night?
Didn't his car bring you into town?
Yes, but I...
Stop that, Ida!
Don't you try to defend her!
All my life I've sweated and slaved, trying to make a decent woman out of her, to give her every advantage, and now look.
Look how she repays me!
How're we going to live?
Where's the next dollar coming from?
So that's all I mean to you!
You're not worried about the scandal, it's just money!
No one will hire me.
Bill!
You were drenched, and all in.
I thought that...
You don't have to apologize, Bill.
You were ice-cold, and I couldn't bring you to.
You'd better drink this now.
I tried to give you some before, but it choked you.
Are you all right now?
But I thought I'd shake to pieces before I got up here.
You probably staved off a grand case of flu.
You shouldn't have tried to climb in this storm.
I didn't care about the rain or anything.
I just wanted to see you.
You wanted to see me that much? Yes.
Don't cry, Ruth, please.
I can't help it.
I never wanted to see anyone so much in all my life.
I'm glad you feel that way.
Ruth, it's been the same with me.
I'm a clumsy ox around women.
I don't know how to say it, but I've been in love with you for a long time.
I wanted to tell you yesterday and lost my nerve.
Last night I couldn't sleep thinking of you.
I need you, Ruth.
Are you going to laugh at me or marry me or cry some more?
I'm going to do all three at once.
Bill.
Can we be married right away?
We'll tell your family tonight.
Ruth ought to be home by now.
I'm worried, driving around in the rain.
Worrying?
Well, you better stop that right now.
I've worried all my life, and you see all the thanks I get.
Annie!
Of course I love you, Bill.
Annie, come to dinner.
In a minute.
You swept me off my feet and carried me away, swooning.
Right now!
Oh, all right.
Soup's getting cold. Ida, Ruth'll be here any minute now.
Well, I'm not going to wait dinner any longer.
Ruth?
Yes, Mother.
Well, it's about time you were...
Why, Bill, we didn't expect you back so soon.
This is a surprise.
We've got a bigger one for you.
Ruth and I are going to get married.
Bill, that's great news.
I'm tickled to death.
Have a cigar.
Ruth, how marvelous! And Bill!
Well!
My baby!
We're so happy to welcome you into the family.
He's not in the family yet, Mother.
Well, of course, but it won't be long now, will it, Bill?
Nobody has long engagements nowadays.
We're going to file our application tomorrow, Mother.
We have to wait three days anyway, so Bill is going back up to the mountain to finish up his work.
Oh, that's fine.
And Sunday we leave for Chicago.
Well!
Oh, Annie, Annie, come in here, dear, and congratulate your sister.
She's going to get married.
To Bill?
Yes, dear.
Oh, gee!
Annie!
Ruth gets the best of everything.
Can't you wait a little while, Bill?
Sure he will, won't you, Bill?
Are you happy?
So much so, I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.
You couldn't lose me.
You talk like a little girl afraid of the dark.
Well, sometimes the dark can be pretty awful when you're alone.
You're going to be with me from now on, and we're taking tonight to celebrate.
The world is yours.
Where do we go?
I don't know. Anywhere.
Say, there's some of the crowd we went to school with.
Bull Con, Eva, Joe!
Why, it's Bill Fadden.
Hello, Bill.
Hi, Bill.
Howdy.
He's with Ruth.
Let's go over.
Wonder when he got back.
Hello, Joe.
How are you, Bill?
Look, he's grown out of short pants.
What're you doing, wearing stilts?
Hello, Conny. Hello, Janet.
Why, hello, Eva, how are you?
Fine, thanks.
Hello, Ruth.
My, it's nice to see you again, Bill, after all these years.
You're handsomer than ever.
I shaved this morning.
We miss you at the bank, Ruth, dear.
You'll have to go on missing her.
We're going to get married Sunday.
You are? Mmm-hmm.
Well, congratulations, Ruth.
Thanks, Eva.
Congratulations, you big hound, stealing our prize gal.
We all resent you, Mr. Fadden.
I don't blame you much.
Go telephone for the hearse, Archie, get the fireman's band.
We'll have a wake.
I'll go you one better than that.
We're going out to Willow Springs tonight to celebrate.
Why don't all of you join us and we'll make a real party of it?
How about it, Ruth?
That'll be fine.
Yes, won't it?
What about females?
Invite anyone you want.
The more, the merrier.
Don't worry, we'll ring in the whole crowd.
It isn't very often a big butter and egg man comes to town to give a party.
No, we've only had one, and that was last Saturday.
We'll try to make this one top it.
See you all about 9:00.
So she hooked Bill Fadden, huh?
Isn't that just lovely.
You know who we'll invite, don't you? Who?
Sheffield.
Conny, you're a genius!
No, I just want to see a few people fall over backward.
Say, when's this surprise coming off?
Don't get excited.
It'll be here. Just keep your eye on the door.
It better be good.
It will be.
I wish we could dance every dance together, Bill.
Catch up a little on the seven years I've missed.
I hate to think of all the times you've been here dancing in some other fellow's arms.
Jealous?
Who wouldn't be?
Hello, lovebirds, having a good time?
We're not exactly bored.
Don't forget. Bill, the next dance is mine.
I won't.
You're at Willow Springs, you know, Bill.
You have to take your girl for a boat ride.
Is that the custom?
That's a very old custom.
Is that true?
Why, he's exaggerating.
Have you gone riding much?
Why, of course, lots of times.
Nothing, I guess.
Look, there's Romer.
That's him, all right.
So that's what Conny had up his sleeve!
Well, I think it's a dirty trick.
You said it.
Where's Miss Randolph's table?
She's with a party at the end table. Thanks.
Hello, Romer.
Hello, there. It looks like a good party.
It will be from now on.
Where's Ruth?
She's dancing somewhere.
Bill, let's slip away from the crowd and get a boat.
We've got to dance with the others sometime.
Well, we can do it later.
I want to be alone with you for some of the evening.
All right, honey, we'll duck out as soon as we finish this dance.
Hello, Ruth.
May I cut in?
Bill, this is Mr. Sheffield.
Mr. Fadden, my fiancé.
Mr. Fadden, my congratulations.
May I finish this dance?
Well, there's not much to say, is there?
Well, I've never lied to you, so I'm not going to congratulate you or wish you happiness, just good luck.
Seems like a fine fellow.
Yes, he is.
You know, I wouldn't have come if I'd known.
Eva didn't say anything about it.
Eva invited you here?
You know, when I came here tonight I didn't think our first dance would be our last.
I hope it's a long one.
Well, you see it wasn't.
Do you mind if I leave you here?
Aren't you coming back to the table?
I think I'll just step out of the picture.
I've caused you enough embarrassment already.
You're very kind.
You shouldn't say that.
It hurts my vanity.
Hi, Archie.
So Romer was your surprise?
Did you see Ruth's face when she spotted him?
She pushed Bill all over the floor trying to keep them from meeting.
Yeah, I saw it, you heel!
For two cents I'd push your face down into your neck!
You don't like it?
No, I don't like it.
Ruth's had enough trouble, getting fired from the bank and having the whole town on her neck.
Give her a break.
She's engaged to be married.
Why should you try and bust it up?
Somebody ought to do the sap a favor and tell him he's getting a second-hand bargain.
I still hope that someday I'll have to pay for that cablegram.
No, not goodbye.
I hate goodbyes.
Did he see me coming?
What do you mean, Bill?
Afraid of my finding out about you two?
There's nothing to find out, Bill.
Except that you got fired from the bank on account of him.
Why did you lie to me if it wasn't true?
Why were you anxious to leave the dance when you saw him coming?
Well, I was panicky, Bill.
I didn't want to see him.
I was afraid that you would find out the things that people are saying about us and believe them.
If it wasn't true, what did you have to be afraid of?
I was afraid of losing you, Bill, and the only happiness I've ever known.
So you tried to rush our marriage.
Even your family tried to hurry us before I could find out.
And you expect me to believe you!
No, Bill, you've got to understand!
Romer!
I can't understand their being out all night.
Well, thank heavens, she'll soon be married and all this worrying will be over with.
Why, Bill!
Will you ask Ruth if I can see her?
Well, what's...
Why, what's the matter, Bill?
We quarreled last night, and I want to talk to her.
Tell her I've got to talk to her.
Well, Bill, she hasn't come down yet.
I don't know, maybe she's still asleep.
But I tell you, Bill, sit down here, and I'll go right up and see.
Give him a cup of coffee, Pa. Sure.
Where's Father?
What are you trying to do, throw away your only chance of getting married?
Coming in at this time of the morning in an outfit like that!
Are you insane?
I'm sane for the first time in my life.
Now, Bill Fadden's in that room.
You get upstairs and change your clothes in a hurry.
You can do your explaining later.
I'll do all the explaining I'm going to do right now.
Well, Bill?
Ruth, I was a fool to say those things last night.
It doesn't matter, now.
Yes, it does.
We can't let a quarrel like that stop our marriage.
We'll be happy.
You've got to forgive me.
It isn't a case of my forgiving you now, Bill.
The things you believed of me last night were lies, but this morning they're the truth.
I spent last night at Romer's house.
And you couldn't forgive that, could you?
No, I didn't think you could.
Never mind, Dad.
I only came back to say goodbye.
Why, where are you going?
I don't know, but I'll write, Mother.
Where to, Romer?
New York.
I owe a minister a bet there.
What about?
Well, he bet that someday I'd meet a girl I'd never want to lose and that he'd marry us.
Say, did anyone ever tell you that your hair is...
Is beautiful?
Hey, pipe down, you mugs.
Sorry to break up the game, boys... but the old man's having bunk inspection in an hour.
Give me my bones!
This man's army ain't been nothing but just one inspection after another.
If ever I get back to Texas on that range again... the first man who says "inspection" to me... he's going to be S.O.L., because he'll hear from my six-shooter.
And I mean sure enough, too.
There'll be no inspection where I'm going.
Where's that?
Why, back into vaudeville with my old lion-taming act!
I wonder if Oscar and Minnie will know me when I step back into the cage.
You better hope they do.
I know what I'm gonna do.
Get me some kind of construction job.
I didn't know that was your line, Sergeant.
It wasn't, but it's going to be.
Being in the Engineering Corps has been swell experience... and I'm making the most of it.
Well, we'll be reading about you in the newspapers, I'll bet.
"Mr. James Allen is building a new Panama Canal." Or something.
You can bet your tin hat Mr. James Allen won't be back in the old grind of a factory.
Do you think he'll be wearing his medal?
Why, of course he will.
-Mom !
-Jim !
It's good to have you back.
You're a little thinner, Jim.
Your cooking will fix that up.
Clint!
Well, you haven't changed a bit.
But, Alice, I wouldn't have known you.
She's grown up, hasn't she?
She certainly has.
And you look different, too.
I think it's the uniform I miss.
It made you look taller and more distinguished.
I got a regular welcome-home party here, haven't I?
Mr. Parker, it's nice of you to be here.
You have a lot to thank Mr. Parker for.
That's nothing.
He feels after all you've been through, we owe you something.
Mr. Parker is going to take you back into the factory.
I've saved your old job for you.
You've done your bit and your boss isn't going to forget you.
Well, I have--
I'm so glad to have you back.
I guess we'd better go home, don't you think?
All right, I'll take this.
I'll see you later, Jim.
The old place hasn't changed a bit.
Well, let's sit down and have a talk.
Tell us all about the war.
I won't live that long.
What did you think of Mr. Parker being at the station?
Say, Clint. Speaking of Mr. Parker, will you do something for me?
Sure. What is it?
Well, will you talk to him for me and tell him I'm not going to take that job?
And why should I tell him that?
But you see, the Army changes a fellow.
It kind of makes you think different.
I don't want to spend the rest of my life... answering a factory whistle, instead of a bugle call... or be cooped up in a shipping room all day.
I want to do something worthwhile.
Jim, how can you talk like that?
He's tired, Mother.
Excited.
You don't know what you are saying.
But tomorrow morning, after a good night's sleep... you'll be ready to take up where you left off at the factory.
A soldier of peace instead of a soldier of war.
I don't want to be a soldier of anything.
You see, Mom... I want to get out.
Away from routine.
I've had enough of that in the Army.
You found another job?
Not exactly, Mom... but you see, I've been doing engineering work in the Army... and that's the kind of work I want to do now.
A man's job.
Where you can accomplish things.
Where you can build, construct, create.
Do things!
That sounds very nice.
But after all... a job in the hand is worth two in the bush.
We've moved things around quite a bit.
This is a lot nicer than the old shipping room, isn't it?
You'll sit by this window and check the shipments.
The job's just about the same.
Before you know it, you'll be doing it again with your eyes shut.
They're excavating.
I shouldn't think that would scare you.
I was looking for the nearest dugout.
You'll hear lots of those explosions.
They're building a new bridge over there.
Better get busy and file those bills of lading.
It might do some good if you had another talk with Jim.
I certainly intend to.
Parker's given him a job anyone in town would grab, and what does he do?
Checks in day after day late from lunch.
Loitering around that new bridge for no reason at all.
He'll come out of it... but it worries me, too.
Is that you, Jim?
It's me, Mom.
Maybe you could speak to him now.
-Hello, Clint.
-You're quite a stranger here.
-Had your supper?
-No, I'm not hungry.
-But you should have a bite of something.
-I can't, Mom.
Well, anyway, sit down.
Jim, Mr. Parker's very disappointed in you.
You haven't shown him anything.
You know your duty is to your job.
I know it, but I just can't help it.
Maybe you're not well, dear.
It isn't that, Mom.
I try my best when I get there, but I just can't concentrate.
It's not the kind of work I want to do.
I said so when I came home.
It's too monotonous.
But you don't seem to realize--
That's it, realize.
No one seems to realize that I have changed.
I've been through hell.
Folks here are concerned with my uniform, how I dance.
I'm out of step with everybody.
All this while I was hoping to come home and start a new life, to be free... and again I find myself under orders.
A drab routine, cramped, mechanical.
Even worse than the Army.
And you, all of you trying your darnedest to map out my future... to harness me and lead me around to do what you think is best for me.
It doesn't occur to you that I've grown... that I've learned life is more important than a medal on my chest... or a stupid, insignificant job.
-Appreciation.
Why, you've--
-Clint.
What would you do, son?
Where would you go?
Anywhere, Mom, just where I can do what I want to.
If that's really in your heart... I think you certainly should follow it.
I knew you'd understand.
Before we know it, he'll be leaving us again.
He's got to be happy.
He's got to find himself.
You're a peach, Mom.
I know where there's a lot of construction going on. Up in New England.
Hey, Allen!
Calling me?
Yeah, knock off a minute.
-Well?
-Bad news for you.
We're cutting down and the new men will have to go.
-You the boss here? -Yep.
Think you could use a good man?
Last week I could have used you, but I'm full up now.
-You're new here, ain't you, buddy?
Just filling in for a couple of days.
Believe me, I'm glad to be working.
It's my first job in four months.
How much can you give me for this Belgian Croix de Guerre?
Come here, mister.
How about some poker to see who bums the handout?
No, I'm afraid not.
I'm new in this town and not on to the ropes.
-Been on the road?
I took to walking the ties when my Rolls-Royce broke down.
-What's your name?
-James Allen.
James Allen?
That'll do, I guess.
Mine's Pete.
-Glad to know you, Pete.
-Glad to know you, Allen.
What would you say to a hamburger?
What would I say to a hamburger?
I'd shake Mr. Hamburger by the hand and say:
"Pal, I haven't seen you in a long, long time."
I think I can mooch a couple in the lunch wagon down the street.
The guy who runs it is a pretty soft egg.
Boy, I hope you ain't fooling.
How about giving me and my friend a handout?
I was hoping you'd left town.
No, I've incorporated.
Meet my partner.
Say, I've been laying off you for a couple of days.
Come on, be a sport.
You guys sit over there.
What do I owe you?
Fifteen cents.
Business is pretty good?
Yeah, pretty good.
How good?
Hey, what is this?
Put your hands on that counter and lean over like we're talking.
Get that dough out of the register.
-Listen--
-Go on, do as I say.
How much is it?
Around $5.
There ought to be more.
Where is it?
No, that's all.
Put it in your pocket and come on.
And don't start yelling for the cops.
You don't have to yell, Mike.
Put them up.
Thought you'd get away?
-Oh, no?
I see no reason for leniency since the money was found on your person.
Furthermore, upon detection, you attempted to escape... which would, of necessity, increase the seriousness of your offence.
I therefore, in accordance with the laws of this state... sentence you to 10 years of hard labor.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6... 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
A nice lucky number.
What's this for?
To put in your nose.
All right, pick them up.
Come on, pull them through.
All right, turn off.
That'll learn you to sit up and hold on to this.
All right, you guys, get going there.
Get those shoes on and get up.
All right, come and get it.
Come on, hurry it up.
Pick up that chain.
Come on, move on.
Here, take that.
Grease, fried dough, pig fat and sorghum.
And you better get to like it... because you're going to get the same thing every morning, every year.
You can't get better food on any chain gang in the state.
Yeah, and you can go all over the world and you won't find worse.
How can anybody eat a mess like this?
Why do you take that slime if you're going to spit it out?
I'm practicing.
The last day of my year here, I'll spit it right in the warden's kisser.
Yeah? You'll blind him for life.
Hurry up, come on, let's go.
Come on, move on!
-Come on, there.
You, get in there.
-Get in that line.
Come on, by me.
Line up, there.
All right, load the trucks.
Hurry up.
Get your rings up.
Put them up.
Come on, get that ring up.
All right, take them out.
Are you up here for murder, kid?
I heard that a guy that killed four people was being sent up here.
Nordine's always worrying about losing his spot here as high man.
He only killed three.
More than anyone else in this here chain gang.
His wife, his sister-in-law, and his mother-in-law.
Killed them in one night with an ax... so as not to disturb the neighbors.
What are you taking the rap for, kid?
For looking at a hamburger.
Come on, tell us.
All right, let's go.
Stick them up.
Hey, you, get to work.
Getting out here.
All right, get out in there.
What's the idea?
He gets two minutes to brush his teeth.
Look at that big buck swing that sledge.
He never misses.
You can lay down a nickel... and he'd knock the buffalo's right eye out.
They like his work so much... they're gonna keep him here the rest of his life.
Come on, get up, quit your stalling.
I was just wiping the sweat off my face.
Well, you got it knocked off.
That won't do no good.
You got to ask their permission to wipe the sweat off.
Wiping it off!
All right, Bomber, wipe it off.
In the first place, you've got to get their permission to sweat.
Come on, get to work there.
I gotta quit.
My stomach is--
You get to work or I'll kick that bellyache up around your ears.
Move on, there.
Pull it through.
Spread them out.
Come on, get out of here.
So this is the washroom?
Yeah, come on, there's plenty of room.
I forgot my bath salts.
All right, boys, show me the men that didn't give us a good day's work.
Ackerman hasn't been on the job today, Warden.
This guy, Red, tried to pull a faint on us today.
Pulling a faint?
I don't care what you do to me. It doesn't matter.
So that's the way you feel about it?
Take a look at that.
The skunk.
You're next.
Take his stinking shirt off.
A loudmouth?
All right, let him out.
Stand over there.
Well, Barney's gone.
Goodbye, Barney, old boy.
Don't forget to write, kid.
I'll see you in two or three years.
Goodbye, kid.
Don't forget to write, Barney.
-So long.
-You need it.
The lucky rat.
At least it proves something.
You really can get out of here.
Sure you can.
And I'm counting the days.
They ain't gonna cheat me out of nothing.
-When is your time up?
-I got it figured out exactly.
Four days, two weeks, seven months and 12 years.
Let me see.
Four weeks from 10 years.
Nine years and 48 weeks.
You can't count those away.
Red's leaving today, too.
All right, hurry it up.
Well, there's just two ways to get out of here.
Work out, and die out.
Might as well grab a ride into town with us.
Yeah, I can't walk very good without them chains on.
Doesn't a man ever break loose?
You mean, hang it on the limb?
There's too many breaks against you.
You've got to beat the chains, the bloodhounds... and a bunch of guards who'd just as soon bring you back dead.
It's been done... but you got to figure out some perfect scheme.
You gotta watch.
You gotta wait.
Maybe one year, maybe two.
Then... hang it on the limb.
Can you hit my shackles hard enough to bend them?
-You thinking about--
-Been thinking about it for months.
If you can bend my shackles just so I can slide them off my foot--
I don't want to get in no trouble, but I'd like to see you get away.
The heat's got the guards down.
-All right, you keep an eye on them.
I'll keep my foot here, and you hit it whenever you can.
You gotta promise not to yell, no matter how it hurts...
-or they'll give me the works for it.
-I promise.
If I hurt your leg, your foot will drop off with the shackle.
Now the other one.
When you gonna do it?
-Monday.
You can rest up for it on Sunday.
-Got any dough?
Here's $7.
When you get to Stanton, look up Barney.
Here's his address.
-He'll take care of you.
-Thanks, Bomber.
-Nervous?
No matter what happens, it's better than this.
Get them over there.
What do you think?
Looks pretty good to me.
All right, get out over in there.
Hey, boss, we need some more help here.
Some of you boys give Bomber a hand.
All right, Allen.
Get back to work.
Bring those dogs over here!
He won't get far.
Stand where you are.
Where do you suppose he's gone?
Let's try these woods over here.
Go get him.
Get him.
You look like a new man.
-Now show me something in a cheap hat.
How did you get the scratches?
Lumberjacking, up in the hills.
Is that a fact?
I know many of them fellows up there.
Funny I ain't seen you before.
-Look out.
Well, if it ain't old John Law himself.
-How's the rheumatism?
-Good.
If they don't take me off nights and put me on days, I'm gonna... I'll...
What's the use?
What's new? Anything?
There was a break on the Merritt County chain gang this morning.
They say he's headed up this way.
What's the guy look like?
He's about 5'10", heavy black hair... brown eyes, stocky built, around 30 years old.
Name is Allen, James Allen.
-Get us a hot towel, will you?
-Coming up.
Hope it's hot enough for you.
Those guys haven't got much chance getting away with it, have they?
We've got the depot and all the highways out of town covered.
They can get this far and no farther.
Come in again.
How was it? Close enough?
Plenty.
So you hung it on the limb?
It's good to see you, kid.
-Well, how do you suppose I feel?
-What? How?
Bomber tipped me off where you were.
-All right for Bomber.
-Say, you got a place I can hide out?
-Sure, come on.
I'll fix you up.
How are all the boys on the chain gang?
No, but I had to keep my eyes open every minute.
Do you think I'll be safe here tonight?
It's a cinch, unless the cops pull another raid.
But don't worry about that.
They're probably too busy looking for you to raid any joints like this.
All I need is some sleep.
I'll lam out of here early in the morning.
We got everything you dream about in the chain gang.
I guess you still know what this is good for?
I got a tough day ahead of me tomorrow.
Well, I got a tough night ahead of me.
I got to beat it now, Jim.
But the place is yours.
I'll get somebody to see that you're comfortable.
Linda, come here.
This is Jim Allen, a pal of mine from the chain gang.
He's just escaped.
-Listen, never mind the advertising.
-It's all right with Linda.
Take good care of him, babe.
He's my personal guest.
-So long, Jim.
I hope you make it.
You've got plenty of what it takes to pull an escape from that place.
I'm not safe yet.
Not until I'm out of the state.
If there's anything I can do to help you, just say the word.
There's nothing you can do.
-How about a drink?
-You don't mind if I take one, do you?
-No, go right ahead.
Here's to you.
A guy with your nerves got the breaks coming to him.
I know what you're thinking.
You have about 35 minutes to wait.
The train is late.
-You want everything on this one, too?
-Yeah, same as the first one.
Well, look who's here.
Chief of police, in all his glory.
Must be looking for somebody important.
All right, boys, keep your eyes open.
Did I get your ticket?
Booneville?
You must have got on without me seeing you.
They were chasing somebody.
I guess you were watching.
-They were after an escaped convict.
-Catch him?
No, the guy they caught turned out to be a hobo.
They're still looking for the convict.
I guess we can use you.
What's the name?
-Allen.
-Is that the first or last name?
Yeah, the first name.
The full name is Allen James.
-Report 8:00 tomorrow morning.
Say, James... that's a swell idea you had about the bend up there.
-I told the boss it was your suggestion.
-You did?
That's very nice.
I don't think you'll be swinging a pick much longer.
This is the room that's for rent.
Very nice room.
What are you asking for it?
-$25 a month.
And that's very reasonable.
-Very.
But it's more than I feel I can pay.
I'm sorry, because I like the location.
It's not far from the bridge I'm working on.
I'm sorry, too... because I'd like to rent this room to a gentleman like yourself.
But you don't know anything about me.
You look like you'd be friendly.
Not like a stranger around the house.
-How much would you be willing to pay?
-Really, it's out of the question.
Well, suppose I made it $20.
You can easily get your price for it.
I'm willing to let it go for $20.
Well, it's a mighty nice room.
You'll like it.
-Hello, honey.
-All you do every night is study.
-I'll never get anywhere if I don't.
Anyway, that's not so.
We were out last night.
-I don't think you like me anymore.
-Of course I do.
We can't always be playing around.
Anyway, what's that got to do with it?
I don't know, but you don't act like you used to.
-Now I don't seem good enough for you.
-You're imagining things.
When you were first here you weren't this way.
You've grown tired of me.
I was silly enough to believe you when you said you loved me.
I said I loved you?
Now, Marie, you know that's not so.
I never said that.
You're just trying to put me in a spot.
And you know it wasn't love just as well as I do.
So that's the way you feel?
You can't make me out cheap and get away with it.
I know what I'm talking about, see?
And someday you're gonna be sorry.
Well, so you really think you're leaving?
I'm moving to a bigger place.
I can afford it now.
In other words, that means we won't see each other anymore.
No, I guess we'll see each other sometime.
You don't mean that.
Marie, I appreciate all you've done for me, but I couldn't love you.
I can't change my feeling towards you any more than... I can change the color of my eyes.
I know I'm speaking bluntly, but frankly... this will save us both a lot of misery.
And is that your only reason for leaving?
-That's a pretty good one, isn't it?
-Not very.
Of course, when a fellow wants to ditch a girl he'll do most anything... providing it doesn't land him back in the chain gang... where he probably belongs.
It's from your brother.
-You wouldn't...
-I wouldn't tell... if I had a reason to protect you.
-I wouldn't tell... if you were my husband.
-Well, it means plenty of work.
-I'm used to that.
Yes. On the other hand, all work and no play... Makes Jack.
How about knocking off and having a little recreation?
We're giving a party tonight at the Club Chateau.
How about joining us?
-I'd like to, but--
And that includes Mrs. James.
I'm not sure that she can come.
-I'll ask her.
-Anyway, we'll expect you.
Here's the revised budget on the King's Highway Bridge.
By the way, while you were out, your wife called.
Any message?
She won't be home until Wednesday.
She's gone to the country with her cousin.
She also said her account was overdrawn.
About $600.
She's got to stop it.
The same thing happened last month.
All right, make out a check for the amount... and deposit it in her bank when you go to lunch.
-Good night, Mr. James.
Hello, yourself.
Is Marie there?
Where do you think she is?
She had a date with me and she's giving me a stand-up... and it's the first dame that ever gave me a stand-up.
You can tell her that Sammy called... and you can tell her where she can go with little Sammy's compliments.
Tell her that, will you?
And listen... not a word to her husband, understand?
-Don't you dance?
-Not if I can get out of it.
That makes two of us.
I don't care much for dancing in such a crowd.
-I don't like crowds anywhere.
-What do you like to do?
Build bridges, roads for people to use... when they want to get away from things.
That sounds interesting.
But they can't get away.
Nobody can.
You're a strange person.
Don't pay any attention to what I say.
You'd like to get away from here right now, wouldn't you?
You don't like this party.
I like it better now.
Well, I was on the verge of sneaking home.
I'm not so sure I want to now.
We might make a getaway.
I don't think they'd miss us.
How about it?
Well, here we are.
Tell me some more about your work.
It sounds fascinating.
Why talk about work?
That's what interests you, isn't it?
No. There are other things that interest me, too.
Do you mind if we stay here a while, or must you go home?
There are no musts in my life.
I'm free, white and 21.
-You're lucky.
You can go where you want, when you want.
You're a strange, moody person.
You need somebody to pull you out of those doldrums.
Are you applying for that job?
-I might consider it.
-You're hired.
-When do I start?
-You've started, several hours ago.
Don't you see, Marie?
If you get a divorce, I'll give you anything you want.
I swear I will.
What's the use of arguing?
I told you I was satisfied with the way things are.
-Can't you see that neither of us is happy?
-I'm happy!
I'm taking no chances of letting you go.
You're going to be a big shot some day, with plenty of sugar... and I'm going to ride right along.
Get that?
I'm no fool.
I'd be a sucker to let you go now.
But I'm in love with another woman.
That's just too bad.
Why don't you play the game square?
Square?
So that you and your sweet mama can give me the grand go-by?
Be yourself.
If you don't listen to reason, I'll find some way.
You do, and you'll serve out your time.
It's no worse than serving out my time with you.
You'll be sorry you said that!
You've held a sword over my head about long enough.
It's about time you called it quits.
You've been bluffing me, and I've been fool and coward enough to fall for it.
You filthy, good-for-nothing convict!
A bluff?
-You'll see.
-Put that down.
-Give me the police station.
-Put that down!
You don't think you'll stop me, do you, now that I've made up my mind?
We'll only take a minute of your time, Mr. James.
In view of your marvelous achievement on the new Stevens Bridge... the Chamber of Commerce would like you as their principal speaker at their banquet.
I feel highly complimented.
There's two detectives coming through, Mr. James.
I told them you were busy but they wouldn't wait.
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
Mr. James or Mr. Allen or whatever your name is... I have a warrant for your arrest.
-And we can quote you literally?
-Certainly.
Everything I've said are facts.
I want this rotten chain-gang system exposed.
Print it all!
How about a special signed story for our Sunday supplement?
Sure, I'll write it.
How long were you on the chain gang before, Mr. Allen?
Governor Baxter has not yet signed the extradition papers.
Until he does, I cannot turn Mr. Allen over to the custody of your state.
Why is it necessary for my client to return at all?
Why mete out punishment to a man who has proven himself a useful... and honorable citizen?
Merely a technicality.
No prisoner is eligible for pardon until he's served 90 days.
Does that mean that I'll have to serve 90 days?
-Back on the chain gang?
You'll be given some clerical job in one of the camps.
Well, it rests entirely with my client... but I'd advise him to stay right here.
Gentlemen, there's someone else I'd like to consult on the matter...
-if you don't mind. -Certainly.
They've promised me a full pardon within 90 days if I go back.
Can you trust them?
I don't see why not.
I'm giving myself up voluntarily.
Besides, I want to get it all cleaned up now... so that nothing will stand in the way of our happiness.
I think it best, darling.
Why, they can't fail to pardon you.
And then, when you come back, you'll be free.
For always.
And we'll be together.
These stories you've been hearing, gentlemen, are absurd.
Why, our chain gangs are beneficial to the convicts... not only physically, but morally. I can cite you--
Gentlemen, I've decided to go back.
Voluntarily.
On your assurance of a pardon.
And you won't regret your decision.
I presume, Mr. Allen, your Chicago attorneys informed you... that I would be in complete charge of your case down here?
Yes, he did.
Let's get the financial end straightened out first.
Your capture and return cost the state... $350.
My fee will be $2,500.
$1,000 now, and $1,500 when you get your release.
This is for the state.
You know, of course... that you'll have to go to a prison camp for 90 days.
-There's your check.
-Thanks, Allen.
There's no reason to believe that after the 90 days... I won't get my pardon then, is there?
This is a funny state and the Governor's a little peculiar.
You see, all that publicity you gave out about the conditions here... didn't help any.
But I'll get my pardon?
They'll give you the pardon.
But that clerical job they promised you isn't so definite.
They might want you to work for about 60 days.
This is the guy that all that fuss was about.
And if he tries to escape this time, shoot him !
Escape?
I'm supposed to be a trustee here.
Haven't you had orders from the Prison Commission?
Sure, I got orders... that if you get away from here this time, I lose my job.
And that goes for all of you.
-Now take him out of here.
Go on. Find yourself a bunk.
Go on down the line.
How did you get to this little bit of heaven, kid?
Sit down, make yourself at home.
If you can.
Boy, if you think those other chain gangs are tough... wait till you get a load of this joint.
These are the guys that were too tough for the chain gangs.
Now give us the story.
How'd they snatch you back?
They didn't.
I came back.
He just got lonesome.
They promised me a pardon if I'd come back for 90 days.
What's a pardon?
These boys up here ain't never heard that word.
Neither has the Prison Commission.
What'd you do to get sent up here, Bomber?
I decided to hang it on the limb, so I socked a guard with a sledge.
I aimed at the rat's head, but I missed.
I can't figure a guy walking back into this... just because they promised to spring him in 90 days.
They just wanna make it tough on me, I guess.
But I'll get the pardon, all right--
Listen, kid, they ain't thinking of handing out pardons when you land in here.
This is the last word.
You might say it's "it."
Come on, get to work down there!
The case of James Allen.
-Is Mr. Ramsey present?
-Ready, Your Honor.
Please be brief.
We have a great many of these cases this afternoon.
I should first like to introduce... the convict's brother, the Rev. Robert Allen.
Your Honor... I shall leave the legal technicalities of the case to Mr. Ramsey... and shall present the story of James Allen as a human being.
A man of essential fineness and integrity of character.
A man who was decorated for bravery in the World War.
A man who committed a crime... but only when forced to at the point of a gun.
His first and only offence.
A man who showed his true character by rising from less than nothing... to become a prominent and honored citizen.
...and in conclusion, I need not remind you... that James Allen has kept his part of the bargain.
He has returned voluntarily to this state... and has paid all the expenses demanded of him.
I cannot believe, in the light of all this evidence... and in the name of justice... that you will bring yourselves even to consider any other alternative.
First, I feel it is my duty... to answer the malicious and unwarranted attack upon the chain-gang system... which we have heard here this afternoon.
Crime must be punished.
The men who commit crime are hard men... and their punishments must be hard.
But the brutality of which we hear is a gross exaggeration... born of the fancy of the misinformed.
The life of a convict in a chain gang is one of hard labor.
The discipline is strict... but there is no brutality.
The purpose of prison is not only to punish crime... but to discourage it.
And there is less crime in this state... in proportion to her population... than in 40 other states in this Union.
The Commission will take the case of James Allen under consideration.
Five minutes, Allen.
They refused to pardon you.
They refused?
The state's promise didn't mean anything.
It was all lies!
They just wanted to get me back... so they can have their revenge.
To keep me here nine more years!
Why, their crimes are worse than mine.
Worse than anybody here!
They're the ones that should be in chains, not me!
You don't have to stay here nine years.
The Commission voted that if you were a model prisoner for one year... they would concede that you had paid your obligations in full.
It's only nine months, Jim.
Nine months of this torture?
I won't do it!
I won't do it, I tell you!
I'll get out of here!
Even if they kill me for it!
It's still better to be honorably free.
And in those nine months, we'll be working for you night and day.
But you've been working night and day!
It didn't do any good.
But, Jim, we'll have the whole country behind you then... and the state will be forced to release you.
I'll wait nine more months.
I'll be a model prisoner... if it kills me.
We've just had a final report on your new hearing.
They've suspended decision.
Indefinitely.
-Which one did you say it was?
-This one here.
Get up, you lazy skunk!
-Driver!
-What's on your mind?
-You better come take a look back here.
-I gotta get to the quarry.
You'll never make the quarry in this truck.
Your spring's broken.
Spring's broken?
-There it is.
He's stealing my truck!
Keep driving, boy.
Throw that box out.
Nix, it's full of my favorite candy.
We're making it, Jim.
We'll make it yet.
Rip it, boy.
Keep going, kid.
That's once I didn't miss.
Getting out here.
Jim !
-Why haven't you come before?
-I couldn't.
-I was afraid to.
-But you could have written.
It's been almost a year since you escaped.
But I haven't escaped.
They're still after me.
They'll always be after me.
I've had jobs, but I can't keep them.
Something happens, someone turns up.
I hide in rooms all day and travel by night.
No friends, no rest, no peace.
-Oh, Jim !
-Keep moving, that's all that's left for me.
Forgive me, Helen.
I had to take a chance to see you tonight.
Just to say goodbye.
-It was all going to be so different.
-It is different.
They've made it different.
I can't let you go like this.
Can't you tell me where you're going?
Will you write?
Do you need any money?
But you must, Jim.
How do you live?
I steal.
I'm afraid we can't do anything today.
We're all upset.
Mr Glidden, you know?
- Yeah, what's the latest report on him?
- He may die any moment.
I understand he's leaving his business to his employees.
Where did you hear that?
Who told you? Did you get it straight?
Listen, uh...
It would be impossible for us to make a decision in this.
Mr Glidden always takes care of these things.
Oh, I see.
You really think he'll do something for you?
I wouldn't dare drop any kind of a hint or the old boy would cut me off.
No, I think dignified silence is best.
Just pretend I'm worried about him, not thinking about the money.
Doctor, is Mr Glidden any better?
Well, his temperature's all right, but his temper's terrible.
- What? Again?
- Again.
- We drew his last will just two hours ago.
- What a man.
I don't wish him hard luck, but if he is dying...
You wish he'd die and be done with it?
Well, he's waiting for you.
Don't talk to me about my employees.
Dummies.
Idiots.
Fools.
Not a business head in the lot of them.
Bankrupt the whole business in a year.
Stupid cowards.
No brains, no nerves. Just a lot of sheep who do what I tell 'em.
When I'm not here to tell them, they'll make a meal for the first wolf that finds them.
- He's been going on like that for hours.
Who's out of whose head?
Who said that I...
Where's my glasses?
Hey, you couldn't find a dumbbell...
- Now, Mr Glidden.
- "Now, Mr Glidden."
I wish I was out of my head!
Then I wouldn't have the sense to worry.
No, Mr Glidden. There's nothing to worry about.
After all, things are...
Nothing to worry about?
I'm dying and I don't know of one man in all the thousands that I employ that's fit to leave in charge of a peanut stand.
I wouldn't say that. Your last will... - My last will's no good!
- You can't... - I forbid you.
Oh, shut up, all of you!
Get away from me!
What do you know about a will anyhow? You're only a lawyer.
Now, Mr Glidden, you shouldn't exert yourself this way.
"Now, Mr Glidden." I'm up, aren't I?
Every time you leave the room, I walk.
I walked over there just a little bit ago.
Nobody's gonna tell John Glidden what to do.
What if it does kill me?
I'm gonna die anyhow. Today, tomorrow, what's the difference?
Now, just a moment and I'll fix you up a...
Yes, I know what you'll fix me.
Ten drops of the most marvellous sedative ever discovered by the medical profession.
Ten drops.
One of these days I'm gonna take 11 drops! Or nine! And see what happens.
I don't want to be fixed, anyhow.
What I want to know is who's going to take my place when I'm gone?
Well, if you're not satisfied with your business associates, perhaps you'd like to make a more generous bequest to your relatives.
Relatives? Ha! Relatives!
Did you see 'em roosting down there like a lot of vultures waiting for an old steer to die?
Relatives! It's the first time in my life I saw them all together.
Ha! - Mr Glidden, you can't go out in the hall.
- I can't? I've been out twice already this morning. Yes.
- Mr Glidden. - Shut up, you quack!
Look at 'em.
My relatives.
Pick out just one for me.
Pick out just one man, woman or child that's fit to pick up where I leave off.
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal, you
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal
Johnny! Oh!
There. That kid's the only honest one of the lot.
Huh! For two cents, I'd leave him my entire for...
I don't like the shape of his head.
No matter how I distribute my money among them, they'll all be miserable.
Those that don't get anything will be crying the rest of their lives.
Those that get plenty will holler for more.
I wish I could collect all of my money together in one pile and burn every dollar of it.
- Now, now. - I do!
You don't really mean that, Mr Glidden.
I do mean it, friend.
I spent my whole life building up a business, amassing a fortune.
Now my life's coming to a close.
I want this business and this money that I leave behind to mean something.
I want to give somebody a chance for happiness.
I just want somebody to have something worthwhile out of what I spent my life to accumulate.
That's my major dying desire.
And for the soul of me, I don't know how to gratify it.
No.
No, Mr Phelps, we haven't placed an order yet.
Indeed, I'd be glad to see your firm is considered, just as soon as Mr Glidden...
- Mr Glidden what?
- Why, uh, um...
Mr Glidden, it was only...
Don't you lie to me.
I know! You were talking to that Phelps, that old tombstone peddler.
Well, don't you buy one of his tombstones to put over me. If you do, I'll come back and haunt him! And you, too!
- Oh, if I could only get him to be quiet.
- How long do you think he has?
I've got it! - I've got it!
Get me the city directory. - Huh?
You heard!
The city directory.
I'll show those vultures.
Now what's he up to?
Why don't you ask me what I'm going to do? You needn't bother.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to leave my money to strangers - people I've never heard of, people that don't expect it.
They may get some pleasure out of it.
- Open that book.
- You can't do that, Mr Glidden.
- Why can't I?
- Well, the relatives would break the will. - Relatives?
- They would.
- I agree.
Oh, they would, would they?
How long am I going to live?
Why, Mr Glidden, I can't tell you that exactly.
Well, I can tell you exactly!
I'm gonna live just long enough to go out and give my money away myself.
Yes, sir! To people I've never heard of.
Give me that doodah - that medicine dropper - and fill it.
At last, I've found a use for that thing.
Give me that book.
The first name that this drop falls on is gonna get one million dollars.
What's that name?
- "John D Rockefeller."
- What?
Hold that book over here. One. Two.
Nobody can tell John Glidden how he's gonna spend his money.
This is one of the nicest we have in the store. I'm sure you'll like it.
Oh, I'm sorry, but that isn't what I want at all.
Good day.
One shopper held me up for two hours, without a bit of encouragement.
- Well, I had two dandy orders.
- Cover that Lalique before you go.
- Uh, Mr Bullwinkle. - Hello, Peabody.
Mr Bullwinkle, sir, they took 11 dollars and 60 cents out of my pay this week.
Well, we can't let you break all the china you want without charging you.
- You should be more careful, Peabody.
- Yes, I am careful.
It isn't always my fault.
It's an awful job carrying china all the time, especially up and down the stairs.
I think I belong back in book-keeping, where I was.
You were delighted when we promoted you. The $5 raise, you forget that?
Yes, I know, but breaking china all the time, I'm really making less money.
- That's organisation, Peabody.
- Couldn't I get back into the books?
Sorry, but we're full up.
However, if you're completely unhappy...
No, no, Mr Bullwinkle, I wouldn't...
I couldn't quit.
My wife would raise...
I guess it'll be all right.
I'll have to be a little more careful.
Remember, Peabody, there's many a slip between the cup and the counter.
- Is that you, Henry, darling?
Did you have a nice day?
Did anything interesting happen?
You didn't break any more china, did you?
That reminds me, this is payday.
So give me your cheque.
Henry, you've been feeding that rabbit again.
Give me your cheque.
That's a darling. I think it's wonderful.
It's perfectly marvellous.
You've no idea the security it gives a woman to know she has a husband who's coming home to her every week with his...
Henry, you broke 11 dollars and 60 cents worth of china.
- Well, you see, dear...
- I see a great deal more than you see.
Of course, you haven't got the worries that I have.
You don't sit here day after day, paying the iceman for milk, the milkman for ice.
Of course, if you want to go on breaking china, that's entirely your own affair.
I think it's perfectly ridiculous the way Mrs Wilkins always boasts about her husband.
I say, "My husband's just as good, even if you don't think so."
You've no idea how I have to defend you to our friends.
Henry, is anything the matter?
Say what you like, but there is such a thing as pride in your own daughter.
She writes that she's happy, but I can read between the lines.
A woman understands things that a man never can.
Unless a girl is well-dressed, she hasn't much chance of marrying anyone worthwhile.
I was the best-dressed girl when you married me.
Not that I'm complaining, but if you don't stop being careless and breaking china, there won't be much chance for her to have the clothes every girl ought to.
Isn't that so, Henry?
Henry, are you listening to me?
Now, I know you're trying, but you're sure to drop this vase which is worth six months of your pay, sweetheart.
Now, Henry, I don't want to reproach you, but I want to make you feel like a dirty rat.
Polly wants a cracker and I want your cheque, darling.
Give me your cheque.
Stop it! Isn't it difficult enough as it is?
Don't you see I'm helping you, Henry?
I told you I'd do it.
But of course, Henry, if you want to make a fool of yourself, I'm not one to whimper and cry.
And if you can't think of your home and your daughter...
Goodbye, Henry dear.
I was telling Mrs Wilkins how wonderful it is to have a husband like Henry Peabody.
Goodbye, dear.
- Mr Henry Peabody?
My name's John Glidden.
Well, uh... If it's about the payment on the piano, I can explain.
- But I...
- Uh... Let's get away from the house.
I have a very good reason.
Uh, look, do you like rabbits?
Rabbits? Not much.
Why? Well, this is how it happened.
My wife gave me the $12 for the payment on the piano and I knew where I could buy a very fine pedigree rabbit for $12.
If you loved rabbits the way I do, you'd know how I felt.
My business with you has nothing whatever to do with rabbits or pianos.
I have something here... 11:10, indeed. Who does he think he is?
When Peabody comes in, send him to me.
- What?
- Look, it's...
You wait there, Theodore.
Peabody, you'll pay for that!
OK, Winky.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
- Charlie, keep track of everything.
- Smithers, call the police!
Yes, go ahead.
Call them all, call them all.
Oh, my soul!
- I was told I'd probably find her here.
- Yup, here's where she hangs out.
Well, you can never tell by looking at a guy, can you?
There she is, mister.
In the flesh.
- Are you Violet Smith? - What about it?
- I want to talk to you.
- Talk?
You wanna talk to me?
Isn't there someplace we can go? Someplace where we can be alone?
I get it. No, no!
No, it's nice down here. We'll stay down here.
It's all right by me, mister.
There's a vacant booth over there.
The letter is in case you have trouble with the cheque.
All right, wise guy.
What's the gag?
- There is no gag, I assure you.
- Don't give me that.
How would you like me to call a cop?
My dear girl, you can call as many cops as you like.
That's perfectly legitimate.
I can't get it through my dome.
You mean that I...
In case you need me, my number's on the letterhead.
Well, hello there, baby!
Well, come here.
Show Miss Smith to 1519.
- Are you sure it's the best in the house?
- Are you Mr Sheldon's chauffeur? - Yeah.
- I thought he had a coloured boy.
- He did, but he fired him.
Too much moonshine, I guess.
Pardon me just a moment.
- Mr Monroe. - Yes? What about this?
If it isn't the work of that forger we've been warned about, I'm crazy.
Look at that n.
It's a false cheque.
There he goes, Mike!
- Are you Eddie Jackson?
- Who wants to know? I do.
I've been trying to get in touch with you all day.
It looks like him, all right.
Only he was in a chauffeur's uniform and didn't have a moustache.
Well, is he the guy or ain't he?
The identification has to be positive, you know.
- I'm positive.
He's the guy, all right. - Great.
He'll go up for life if we catch him. - Life?
For forgery? - Sure.
It's his fourth offence.
Sure it means life. Locked up as long as he lives.
Yes, it's absolutely all yours.
Can I do what I want with it?
You can spend it exactly as you please, young man.
When can I get cash on this?
I gotta blow town and I'm in a spot. - Cash?
- Yes, I gotta have it.
It's my dough, ain't it?
Why do you need so much cash?
I need it, that's all. And where can I get it?
- Aren't you known at any banks?
- Plenty.
I'll take care of that.
You'll have to excuse me now, Pop.
- Good luck. - Thanks. I'll need it.
And thanks a million times.
I'm afraid that's impossible, Mr Jackson.
No bank has that much cash. Oh, of course.
Well... well, could I have part of it?
- How much would you like?
- Would 100,000 be too much?
Well, I'll have to see about it, Mr Jackson.
If you'll kindly endorse this, I'll see what I can do about it.
Forger! Forger!
Bank forger escapes!
- Paper, mister?
- Gimme all of them. - All of 'em?
- Gee, thanks!
Now scram.
Just a moment, Mr Jackson.
Mr Galloway. I want to congratulate you on your good fortune.
Mr Bolan tells me you'd like some cash - a rather considerable amount.
I was planning quite an extensive trip.
I see. But that's a lot of money, you know?
However, if you wait in my office, I'll see if it can be arranged.
I'd rather wait here. You see, I was expecting Mrs Jackson.
Read all about the bank forger.
You think I'm a fool?
I wouldn't cash a cheque for $10 for you.
It's on the level.
The whole thing is yours for 50 grand.
Just because I need dough and I can't cash it myself.
I've read the newspapers and you're hot - hot as a stove.
You figured out this little scheme to get some quick dough.
You'll have to try it on somebody else, Eddie.
I hope you find the right sucker.
- Where's Mike?
- In the office.
Who do you think you're talking to? A child?
It's on the level - a certified cheque.
No cheque you ever have is certified.
I'm going off my nut.
The cops have got a plant on my place.
I'm walking around without a dime, with this!
I can't even buy a cup of coffee. I'm going crazy.
Give me ten grand, enough to blow out of town.
Or five. Or a grand for the million.
Say, if you're so convinced that cheque's good, why don't you go to Glidden?
Tell him your troubles.
- I wanna see Mr Glidden.
- Mr Glidden has gone to bed.
- I gotta see him. He gave me money.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's a matter of life or death.
He gave me the cheque, only could you tell him to make it out in cash?
That's fair enough, isn't it? You gotta ask him, I tell you!
Mr Glidden's cheques are always good. You can go to any bank in the city.
Now, get out or I'll call the police.
- I wonder what's the matter with him?
- I don't know, lady.
Hey, how about the dime first?
I haven't got it now, but I'll get it.
You can't flop around here without dough. This ain't no mission.
Outside.
No, I can't go out there. I gotta sleep, I tell you!
Take this. It's a million bucks.
You can keep it till I pay you.
Let me sleep, will you?
A million bucks, all right.
Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, sure.
I got something out of it!
It's always good and I can cash it at any bank!
Hello. This is Murphy's flophouse.
Say, you better send a couple of cops down here.
There's a guy here who's off his nut.
He just gave me a million dollars for a bed.
- Agnes. - Oh, Emily!
You sounded the same over the telephone and you look the same in the flesh.
- You've lost a little weight.
- No. No, darling. Pound or two maybe, just here and there.
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
I'm very happy, Agnes, and I'm doing fine.
There ain't much more to what I told you.
I've been doing five a day, day in and day out.
When was it we played together last? Was it Wilkes-Barre in '23?
'24, my dear.
I shan't forget that year.
It was the winter Rollo had that bad cold.
Why, I had him in mustard and vinegar for two months.
I remember that egg.
He was the juggler.
You sure were lucky to lose him.
I didn't lose him.
Rollo is here with me now - partner in this tearoom.
Oh, and, gee, it's a swell tearoom, too.
It's been wonderful having this place for our own to settle down in.
You know, Agnes, after 30 years of it - one-night stands and split weeks - that's about all you ever dream of, a place of your own.
- You're telling me.
- I've got everything I ever dreamt of. Excepting one thing.
And that's on its way.
It's here! It's here!
- Did you chirp for me, my little wren?
- Rollo, it's here! It's here!
It's here.
A thing of beauty, my dove.
- A beauty second only to your own.
- Oh, Rollo! Let's go and look at it.
Excuse me, I forgot.
You know Agnes Dupont.
- Hi, Miss Dupont. Queen of the high wire.
What do you play these days? Revivals?
I headline bills they wouldn't even let a juggler on.
- Oh, Rollo, let's go look at it.
- Coming, my little chickadee.
I wish you luck.
I wish you'd remember you're not handling cigar boxes, but an automobile.
I find it difficult at this time to remember that you're a woman.
I wish you'd forget. I'd like nothing better than to knock your ears into your neck.
I suppose you forget the day I busted you in the nose in Cincinnati? - Rollo.
- Yes, my little glow-worm?
- Can't we go on?
- Yes, my sweets.
We'll be rolling in half a tick now, dear.
- Here you are, my buns.
- Are you happy, Emily?
- This is the happiest day of my life, including the time I stopped the show at Terre Haute.
You were inspired that day.
It was a red-letter day in the history of bird acts.
Do you remember what I did to them that day?
17 bows. The manager wanted the great Rollo.
- Rollo, darling, can't we go on?
- Good work, Rollo.
- Nothing really.
- Is everything all clear?
Are you hurt, my little fledgling?
But look at my car!
You should've let me kill him.
The man is worse than a murderer. He's a road hog.
All our lives, we've worked and saved for this one thing, and then this had to happen!
Road hogs - a constant menace to society.
They should be wiped out, Emily.
Do you hear? Wiped out!
Oh, uh, here she is, sir.
- Are you Miss Emily La Rue?
My name is John Glidden.
If you dare suggest, sir, that we were in any way at fault, I shall lay hands upon you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
My business is with Miss La Rue.
She thanks you, sir. A thousand times, she thanks you.
Would you mind telling me, now you have money, what you're going to do with it?
- Not that you have to, but...
- It's yours, my sweet.
You must use it to gratify your every whim.
Oh, but half of this money is yours, Rollo.
What do you want?
Nothing, my little bird.
There is something I would like to do, something I would like to do right now above everything else in the world.
- At your side, my beauty.
- Yes, my sweets. Where?
Come.
- Will it run?
- Oh, perfectly.
- We'll take it.
- Now, show us another. - Yes, ma'am.
Right this way.
Now, here's the best buy on the lot.
A fine-looking jalopy.
Looks like a cement mixer.
- We'll take that one, too.
Can you furnish us with some strong, brave drivers?
- Yes, sir. On a minute's notice.
- Splendid.
See any road hogs, my little fledgling?
Rollo!
Beaver!
How did you like that, you great snorting road hog?
Nice work, Rollo.
Here you are, my little penguin.
Be careful, dear.
There you are, my sweets.
Onward, my men!
Get him, Rollo!
- Coming up, my dear.
- Are you hurt?
No, my little sweet potato.
Well, come on, the day is young.
Get him, Rollo!
Rollo, that was a peach!
Thank you, my dear.
We shall carry on until sundown.
Perhaps you'll move over the next time, you road hog.
Look what you did to my car!
Boys, you've been very good. Very patient.
Much obliged to you.
Rollo, pay the chaps off.
- Good luck. Same to you. - Thank you.
- Yes, my dear? Another beaver?
- No, no. Look.
- Why not? You can afford a new one every day for years.
Everything clear, my little chickadee?
All clear.
- Are you hurt, dear?
- No, dear.
But, oh, Rollo, look at your hat.
Yes, my sweet. I must have it reblocked.
Oh, Rollo!
It's been a glorious day!
Yes, it has, my little mud tur... uh, turtle dove.
And graciously remit the guilt of my past offences.
And graciously...
Why don't you stop them from killing me instead?
I don't want my soul saved.
I wanna live!
- Wallace, listen.
- Make them listen. Ask them why they're sending me to the chair.
Make the district attorney listen. His soul needs saving.
He's a murderer, not me.
- Only one thing can help you now.
- A good lawyer, you mean?
He could've helped me.
I'm going to be killed because I didn't have money for a good lawyer.
Did you ever hear that before?
I never handled a gun before.
I wasn't thinking what a hold-up meant.
You can't think when you're hungry.
Open her up.
Come out.
- Your wife's here.
Mary.
No, I can't see her. What did she come for?
You asked for her. The warden got her special.
- This is the toughest deathwatch I've had.
What can I tell her, Father?
What can I tell her so she'll want to go on living?
Then talk about living.
Living?
But I wanna tell her I love her, and I'll break up if I do that.
- What if I start to blubber?
- Well, just try hard, Wallace.
What's the good word, Mary?
John, dearest. He's been here, hasn't he? The lawyer?
Landlady still hounding you? The old hag.
- He has been here, hasn't he?
- Sure. Now, keep the flat warm, kid. Chilly place gives anybody the creeps.
Keep the gas going. There'll be money for that, too. That's the last thing to save on.
John, he said it'd be all right, didn't he?
And don't be saving on food, either.
- He told you not to worry, not even now.
No picking up scraps or tossing off a sandwich and getting run down, see?
- I don't like you that way.
- Cos I wouldn't know what to do, John.
- I told you it'd be all right, didn't I?
- But I couldn't stand it.
You won't have to, I said.
John, I'd never be able to forget.
Now, Mary, look here.
Let me out of here!
This money gives me no right to delay execution.
- It's needless torture to tell him anything.
- Wait a minute. Has he any family?
- A wife.
- Then he has a right to see this money. Not at all.
Why can't you give it to her yourself without his seeing?
Because it would be a great comfort to him to know he was leaving it to her, to know that she was being taken care of.
- That's his right, don't you think so?
What's it about?
Hey, Warden!
You can't kill me now, do you hear?
You can't kill me now!
A million, tell him. And it's mine.
- There it is. A million dollars.
I can live! - He's got a shot in his arm!
Put it in a good bank where you're going - a bank that's fireproof.
Take me to the warden, will you?
I gotta see him.
They can't put me through now. I'll get a new trial and I'll get out.
Come on, take me to him.
The warden's coming here, ain't he?
Well, he is, ain't he?
What are you doing this for?
Hey, tell the warden not to let Mary go away, will you?
I wanna see her again.
I wanna tell her myself.
I wanna see her face when I say, "We're all right now, kid."
"Didn't I tell you we'd be all right?"
Hey, you can't do that. I'm not going to burn.
Didn't you hear what I told you?
You think I'm gonna walk out with my head shaved?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.
Where to? You mean the warden, huh?
- I'm gonna get the warden, huh?
It's a new deal for me. The right lawyer.
I can pay for him now.
He can have it all if he wants it.
Mary would say so, too.
I wanna go to the warden, not in there!
It's a million, I'm telling you!
I'm yelling it at you and you won't listen to me!
It's a million!
You can't do it now!
You can't do it now!
Mr Brown?
In the guardhouse again?
You get no sympathy from me.
You can rot in there, you double-crossing mouse.
It ain't enough that you sneak a date with Marie. No. You have to swipe every dollar me and Gallagher has behind our backs.
- You'd have blown it on a dame anyway.
- Us blowing it and you blowing it is different.
Socking a sergeant just because he tried to take your dame.
A fine marine you are.
Well, he insulted Marie, that's why. Gee, he called her "a soldier's plaything".
- Get wise, you sap. Get wise.
- Yeah, get wise to yourself, Mulligan.
A guy like me could handle 50 of your kind and love it.
What's the use of having a swell guardhouse like this and nobody in it? Besides, I've got to create discipline. Ain't that right?
- Yeah, it's the only thing.
I always say it.
- You shouldn't have called her a plaything.
- Shut up!
- Are you going our way? - I'm going this way.
What a coincidence!
That's the way we're heading.
The kid's all wrong.
He should know no tramp can get away with socking a sergeant.
- Not in a million years.
- Suicide, that's what it is.
- Shooting 80,000 bucks.
- I'll take 40,000 of that.
You know, I wanna thank you for socking the sergeant.
It makes a fella's heart feel good to know he's got pals... Stop.
You're turning my stomach.
Do you wanna cover the other 40,000 or not?
- Yeah, keep your tears off them IOUs.
- I got it. 40,000. Shoot.
That makes 360,000 bucks you guys owe me.
- Shooting 40,000. - I'll take 20.
I got 20.
You're not supposed to, but if the captain says it's OK...
It's quite important that I see this man.
I've had very great difficulty locating him.
If it was real money, I'd hire you as butlers and make you work it out.
That's life in the marines.
I'll take the whole works.
- Mr Gallagher?
- Yeah, I'm Gallagher.
- 45,000. - 45,000?
I got that.
Mr Gallagher, my name is John Glidden.
I have something here for you. - What is it?
- A million dollars.
A million bucks, huh?
Scram, Pappy. This is a guardhouse, not a nuthouse. - Come on.
- I can well understand your surprise.
But it's my own personal cheque for a million dollars.
Listen, you're interrupting an important crap game.
- Go on, beat it.
- You have a right to know...
Go away, you're bothering us. You better go and get Henry Ford and we'll have tea.
How can he?
He's Henry Ford.
Well, of all the impertinence I ever heard in my life! - Outside, old-timer.
- Wait just a minute!
I want to explain.
This is a fine state of affairs! A fella can't enjoy a quiet crap game.
If anybody else calls for me today, I'm out.
The man's a lunatic!
I suppose you dopes thought I was dumb enough to fall for that gag?
- You are. - Mm-hm.
If you'd picked a guy who looked like a millionaire, I still wouldn't have believed it.
In second place, a smart guy don't play April fools jokes on April 1.
He waits until July when nobody's expecting it.
- We're all crazy.
- Coming out for the million. - I'll take 500,000.
- I got the rest of that.
Go on, you play it.
Shoot.
- I've got an order for your release, jailbirds.
- Where do you get that "jailbirds"?
Out my way, boy.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Where was you guys brought up? You can't leave this place messed up like this.
- Get that play money outta here.
- Don't you want two million?
I could write a billion of this kind of dough. Come on.
Take it, take it.
Well, keep in touch with us.
Fresh air smells terrible, don't it? What are you gonna do?
Dash off a letter to my mother and thank her for that chocolate cake you ate.
I think I'll get a little sleep.
How about you, Mulligan?
I just happened to remember, I put in for some blues.
I'll get them. - I'll be seeing you.
- Right. - Right.
- Right.
How about the carnival for tonight for just you and me, huh?
- You got any dough?
No dough, no carnival.
So this is the way you write letters to your old mother?
You ought to be ashamed.
- You look hot in those new blues.
- I won't answer that. Honey, what's he trying to get you to do?
- You want to take me to the carnival? - Yeah, that's a date.
You got any dough?
- Well, a fella down the line...
- Ah. No dough, no carnival.
I thought you birds was writing and dressing.
I see you're walking in your sleep again.
You two shouldn't try to double-cross each other. It always shows in your eyes.
- You got dough to take me to the carnival?
- I can raise it.
No dough, no carnival.
I guess I'll go with the sergeant.
Zeb, we've come to the conclusion that maybe you could advance us a couple...
How about some dough from you fellas?
We were gonna ask you to lend us a couple of dollars on account.
On account of what?
On account of Marie wants to go to the carnival.
How much do we owe?
It reckons up to four dollars and 50 cents. That's for the three of you. - How do you know?
You can't read.
- But I make marks nobody else can read.
- We gotta pay cash for our hamburgers? - Yep.
Listen, I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
No money, no hamburger.
Wait a minute. You got us all wrong, Zeb.
We're the kind of guys that pay our bills.
And I'm the kind that has dough when he takes a girl to the carnival.
- Cheque? How much for?
- Sure, ten bucks.
- Ten bucks even.
It's all right, Zeb. It's for ten bucks.
- It's as good as Confederate money.
The carnival, honey.
You and me, we'll blow the rest of this cheque.
Now you're talking like the sergeant. OK.
- So we're all going to the carnival?
- No, we're not "all".
Marie and me. - Wait.
Whose gal do you think she is? - Mine.
Marie and me is going alone.
- It's half our dough.
We helped you.
- You and me is going to the carnival! Hey!
What are you yelling for?
- It's a great life, ain't it?
- Good morning. - How do you do?
- Where from did you guys come from?
- My goodness, what awful grammar.
- Will you guys scram? - Wonderful night, Mulligan.
Yes, it is.
How about a little baseball, buddy? Four balls for a dime.
I wanna play baseball!
- Baseball's right down my alley. - Mine, too.
You can throw all the balls you want.
Step right up, folks, and see the little lady win a prize.
Look, honey, like this.
Ah, you missed!
"Yeah, honey, like this." - The pride of the Marine Corps.
They missed every one of them!
Say, who's paying for these?
Mr Gallagher, the gentlemen on the end, is the moneyed man.
Get this straight, I'm paying for the lady and myself.
I never saw these two mugs before in my life.
- There's a pal for you.
- Have you got any money?
No, sir.
I gave my last $50 to the blind man at the corner.
- Let's see some cash.
- You show us some.
Smart guy, eh? Hey, Mike.
Joe.
You guys were figuring to gyp me out of some dough? No, we wasn't.
We just ain't got no money, that's all.
But you threw some balls, didn't you?
Yeah, but we didn't hit anything.
You marines are so tough, ain't you?
I don't like men to paw me.
A kiss for Cinderella.
Take 'em boys! Here, honey.
Go buy yourself a soda. I'll be back.
Don't you get ashamed of yourself, always getting me and O'Brien in trouble?
Yeah, always socking somebody.
You're a worse influence on me than women.
I wouldn't be surprised if we got the electric chair.
Yeah, I guess I'm just a bad guy.
But then, maybe it ain't all my fault. Maybe you got something to do with me getting in trouble. - There's a pal for you.
- Stabbing us in the back. Look!
Look at what I'm looking at.
Gee, I wonder where Zeb got all the cash?
Boy, him and Marie look like they found a million bucks.
A million bucks?
Say, I wonder if that cheque was any good?
I think I'll go lie down.
That's Eddie. You know, he's my oldest.
He earns 6,000 a year.
Only last week, the superintendent sent for him and said he may be promoted.
I never had but just the one child, you know.
It would've been different if there'd been four or five. Then I could've visited around, a little while here and a little while there.
That's when me and my husband played The Face on the Barroom Floor in Schenectady.
There, there, dear.
Don't take it so hard.
- All of us has got to die sometime.
- Oh, it ain't that.
It's just that there ain't no more people that I know left to die.
You see, Jim, we can move into that house at Gainsborough.
The one we talked about, with the shutters and the cistern.
- Good morning, ladies.
And how is our little family circle today?
All well and cheerful, I see.
We have so much to be thankful for, haven't we?
- Now, isn't that much better? - Yes, Mrs Garvey. Very.
Oh, ladies, what is this?
How many times have I told you that these coverings must be left tucked in?
When they're tucked in, Mrs Garvey, they cramp our feet. No, no, no.
How many times have I told you card playing is not permitted?
It promotes ill feeling.
We never feel ill from it, Mrs Garvey.
We kind of like to...
I'm afraid we can't risk it, Mrs Davis.
We pride ourselves on preserving harmony here at all times. Anything that might tend to disturb the happy serenity of...
Heavenly days! What's that?
- Don't tell me I cannot cook! - You can't!
- You say that to me?
- To you!
- That's me.
- What's the trouble?
- She wants to bake biscuits.
- Well, no crime, is it?
I baked biscuits for 50 years before I came to this place.
The first batch I ever put in the oven turned out better than anything he ever made. - Ah!
- Mr Papadopoulos.
You wanted to make biscuits because you think he can't cook? No!
I wanted to bake biscuits because I wanted to bake biscuits.
I like to make biscuits. I made them all my life.
Why shouldn't I make them now?
Now, Mrs Walker, suppose we let all the ladies in the home make biscuits. Suppose you did?
You'd have a lot of good biscuits.
Now, Mrs Walker, we've been patient with you - too patient.
- Perhaps if we'd...
- Patient? You've been patient?
Why, only yesterday, when I brought a little kitten...
You know our rule against cats. They're disease carriers.
Disease carriers? Then why ain't I dead?
I've had cats all my life.
None of them ever carried any disease where it could hop onto me.
All the other women in this house have had lots of cats, I bet you they did.
- Now, let me tell you...
- Mrs Walker, I'm not going to argue.
This is not a penal institution, you know.
You're free to go any time you're dissatisfied.
Free to go. Oh, sure.
Just like that.
Back to my son and daughter-in-law where I'd only be in the road?
Or to some furnished room or hotel where I'd be all alone, day after day.
"Free to go." Hmm.
You know, I've been thinking.
If things pick up, maybe I can get out of here and me and Jim can get a place again.
A little place, you know. Somewhere... I know.
I know, honey.
That's what you should do.
Just like George and I did.
- The mailman.
- I always get a letter on Wednesday.
Only a letter for Mrs Walker.
May I take it? - Oh, certainly.
- Thank you.
- There's a letter for you, dear.
Nothing happened at home, did it? No.
I always act like this when I get a letter.
It makes me feel so good.
Me, too, if I'd got anybody to get one from.
Mrs Walker, would it be asking too much to read it out loud?
No, I... I'd be glad to.
You know, the fact of the matter is, my daughter says such funny things, it brings my lumbago back on me from laughing.
"Dear Muzz..."
My daughter-in-law always calls me "Muzz".
It's just a pet name.
Sort of silly, but she does it.
"Dear Muzz..."
"It seems like we've been more lonesome for you than usual this past month."
"Only last night, Eddie..."
- What's the matter, dear?
What's the use of pretending?
I was just making it up as I went along.
It's all a lot of lies!
They never write to us any more.
They don't miss us!
Ladies.
I want you all to know Mrs Small, who's joining our little family.
I'm sure you'll be happy here, Mrs Small.
We do our very best, within reasonable limits, of course, to make our guests perfectly at home.
If you'll take off those clothes, one of the girls will bring you a uniform.
- Where shall I undress, please?
Oh, but I couldn't do that.
Why, I've never even done that in front of my husband.
Nonsense. You'll soon get over that, Mrs Small.
Now, let me see.
Oh, yes.
This will be your bed, Mrs Small.
I think you'll find everything quite...
Why, where is the pillow?
Oh, here it is.
- No, Mrs Garvey, please.
- It's my husband's pillow.
- Your husband?
Why, I never heard of such a thing.
Mrs Walker! How dare you?
I'd dare anything rather than have you blab to Mrs Scott that her husband's dead.
- She knows her husband's dead.
- Certainly.
But the only joy she has is pretending that he ain't.
You're not going to stop her doing that if I can help it!
- Mrs Walker, you've gone too far.
- Too far? I ain't gone half far enough.
I'm going to tell you what a sanctimonious old...
Stop! Mrs Walker, I'm going to call your son and tell him to come and take you away.
And I'll take pains to tell him what an unruly, meddlesome...
Tell him! Tell him!
- I'm unruly, am I? Meddlesome, am I? - Yes!
- I came here to see Mrs Walker.
- Of course, Mr Glidden. - Just as soon as Mrs Garvey...
- Go on, call him!
See if I care!
I'm going to get this off my chest to know the reason why.
I'll teach you to break poor old women's hearts just to see the pieces fly!
Please, Mrs Walker.
This is Mr Glidden. He's...
- I'm going to tell you just what I think...
- Just one moment, please.
If you'll talk to me first, you can finish what you have to say.
- I'm sorry, but Mrs Walker...
- Try and stop me!
- Well, what do you want?
- I want to talk to you alone, if you please.
Eavesdropping. What does this mean?
Get back to your rooms immediately.
Come here, somebody!
Mrs Walker, she's fainted.
You wouldn't fool me, would you?
I wouldn't fool you for a million dollars.
I'm very sorry. I only work here.
I can't help it if you're a son.
Nobody's allowed in without Mrs Walker's permission.
As long as you're getting $200 a month from me, you will rock. - But that's all you will do.
- But, Mrs Walker...
It's rock or quit.
Well, if it suits you.
- What a life!
- You're telling me.
Three queens and a pair of jacks.
And me with a cockeyed straight.
Mrs Walker, what are you putting the top...
Who's making these pies?
- You, Mrs Walker.
- You bet your life I am.
Now, I'll attend to the pies, you attend to your rocking.
That's what you're getting paid for.
- Nice music.
- It's hot!
I'll say it is!
A million dollars!
No, I'm sorry. You can't speak to Mr Glidden.
Yes, sir, but those are my orders.
How much longer?
The directors have been waiting three quarters of an hour for him.
Yes, sir.
I've tried, but I can't go in.
He throws books at me.
Well, I wash my hands of the whole thing.
Nobody can blame me. I warned him.
That will of his, the one he made all the fuss about...
Well, right now, there isn't any sort of a will.
Marvin, I'm going in there and taking him home.
I've told him two hours' work a day is his limit, and I've been waiting that long.
- Yes, sir. - Open that door.
Marvin, what's happened?
Shut up! Shut up and go away!
- "But what?" Can't you leave me alone?
Can't I have any privacy at all without a lot of doctors and secretaries butting in on me all the time?
There's important matters to take care of.
Let somebody else take care of them. Pretend I'm dead.
- Yes, sir. - What?
Go away, go away.
Mr Glidden, that pie!
In your condition!
What's the matter with my condition?
Look. Two of them, since last Wednesday. - All by myself.
That reminds me, I must make a note to Mrs Walker telling her to lay off the apple pies for a while and make me mince pies.
- Mince!
Mr Glidden, I think you've completely lost your mind.
Do you think so?
That's great.
If I'd lost my mind ten years ago, I'd have been as happy then as I am today.
- Now, Mr Glidden... - Shut up!
Yes?
Will I?
Well, I should say I would.
I'll be right over.
And listen, you save a place for me right next to you, will you?
O, Genevieve
Sweet Genevieve
- Where do you think you're going?
- You guess.
Home to bed.
That's where you're going.
You know where I'm going, you old medicine dropper?
I'm going for a hayride.

Nice day for your wedding.

One is yours. And the rest... are for the Vicomte de Barres.
Vicomte de Barres?
The best dressed man in France?
I'm making all his clothes now, and he'll make my reputation.

The girl's husband. He came home unexpectedly.
What girl?
Well, she is...
Well, I don't remember.
The husband started running after me, and I ran, and I found myself in the race.
I presume Monsieur Vicomte has no more need of this.
No, no, I got it off a fruit stand.
Emile, Emile... would you mind giving the room to Monsieur Vicomte, please?
Yes, yes, with pleasure.
Thank you, thank you, Maurice.

Oh, thank you, Monsieur Vicomte.
What about my friend, the shirt-maker, who's making the new shirts for you?

And what about my friends, the hatter and the boot-maker?
I'll pay them all at once. A clean sweep, Maurice.

And now, Maurice, eh...
Do you suppose you can let me have a little something?
Money?
Yes, yes...
You see I'm running around without my wallet.
How much could you spare?
A thousand francs?
Oh, no no, that's too much. I should say 500...
- Oh, Monsieur Vicomte, take the thousand.
- No no no...
But Monsieur Vicomte, you're going to need it.
Well I'll tell you. You let me have the 2,000 and we'll say no more about it.
Tomorrow, Maurice, I'll be here with bags of gold for you. - Bags of gold.

Princess?
Count, I'm going to bed.
- I've just come up to join you.
- Join me? Join you in a little chat before dinner.
Not tonight.
I've had another fainting spell and my uncle, the Duke, thought bed was the best place for me.
I always think that do you wonderful well.
- Count, why the ladder?
- Oh, it's more romantic.
Oh, I've brought along my flute, hoping to entertain.
No, count. Not tonight.
Oh, before I go. Remember what I said to you down by the horse trough?
- Quite well. - Oh, What was it? I simply wish to see if it made any impression.
You said "I love you". Made no impression whatever.
There's probably no use of repeating the sentiment at this time.
None at all.
Oh, Princess... I trust you don't find my wooing too ardent.
I was just admiring your restraint, good night, Count.
On with the dreams, Princess.
I'll never be able to use it again.
Oh, Count, did you break your leg?
No, I fell flat on my flute.
- Yes, no league, no.
- But not too long.
Oh, may it help our niece grow strong.
Plants from the woods and birds from the dales are certain cures for fainting spells.
Please heaven, we no start in vain.
May morning bring her health again.
Oh, ¿what?
My dear Duke, you can get rid of me for 20 thousand francs.
My dear Countess, I...
You're staying here, Valentine. What you need is more of the simple life, young woman.
- Oh, uncle...
- I say... come in.
- The new footmen, your grace.
- Uncle...
Can't we ever get a footman under forty in this place?
Valentine.
About the schedule for the guests for tomorrow, your grace...
Tomorrow?
Bridge, at three... And dinner, at eight.
And after dinner, bridge.
- Rather an amusing day, Flammand? - Quite exciting, your grace.
And what are the guests doing now, Flammand?
Playing bridge, your grace.
You wait. I'm going right back to Paris.
A man?
Oh no, just cousin Gilbert.
Trying to get up enough energy to go to bed.
What are you doing in this dull hole?
Oh, I'm just passing through. I got a taxi waiting to take me back to Paris.
Take me with you.
That's not a bad idea.
It may save for haven't to see uncle.
How much money can you loan me?
I'm over my allowance and uncle won't let me have any money.
Oh, you don't know how to handle the old sky-hawk.
I'll tell him I need the money for charity. To provide good homes for bad stenographers.
- Aha. Send that taxi away.
No, no uncle, now look, I've got to go back to Paris.
You can't. You're staying here permanently.
And if I hear any more about your debts, any more bills, I'll cut you off without a soudle.
Now, you understand?
You imp... imp...
- Now, what's the word?
- Impecunious. - No, no, no. - Impudent?
- No, no.
- No, no. - Impostor.
- Impertinent.
- Ah, that's it.
- You impertinent jack... jack...
- Jackal?
- Well I'm sorry.
- Jackass?
No, no. I wish you go to bed.
Jackanapes.
You impertinent, jackanape, liar, cheat. Liar. Cheat.
- - You'll be insulting me in a minute. - Nitwit.
Numbskull.
Nincompoop. Lord, grant her rest be sweet and deep.
And knights go riding through her sleep.
Her own Prince Charming, young and bold.
Who came to Princesses of old.
- Never to us... - Never to us...
Never to us.
Stir slowly...
Slowly, and may it heal her howling.
- I want the money for my shirts.
- And my shoes. And my hats. You introduced him to us.
You said his trade will bring other business. It will. We must be careful not to insult the Vicomte de Barres.
He comes from the old nobility, - quick to take offense.
- And slow to pay. - Maurice Courtelain?
I understand you made a lot of clothes for the Vicomte de Barres...
Ah, you see, you see Monsieur, that I made a lot of clothes for the Vicomte.
If Monsieur will take a chair... I'll show him samples.
- Monsieur is a friend of the Vicomte?
- Not at all.
You know who I am?
Oh... now I understand.
Oh, Monsieur, monsieur, why don't you try to forgive and forget?
This is Paris, city of romance, love.
Please, forgive the Vicomte and forgive also your wife.
I have no wife.
What is all this?
You are not the man who chased the Vicomte in his BVDs?
Certainly not.
I am the credit manager of the Association of Retail Merchants.
I came here to tell you, that not a tailor in Paris will make that fellow a suit without full payment in advance.
You... you... you mean...
I mean... the Vicomte de Barres never pays.
The Vicomte, never pays...
- My shirts.
- My hats.
- My boots.
- My suits...
Gentlemen... you have my profound sympathy.
The old nobility, eh?
Do you know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to have a crowd march down there and attack that chateau.
- Wait. That's an idea...
- You think we could? Just like in the old days?
What about the police?
I don't mean attack it in a crowd.
Let me attack it, alone.
I'll be a one-man French Revolution.
Let me have all the goods the Vicomte ordered.
I'll deliver them to the chateau. And I'll make him pay.
Maurice. I just heard you were going. Let me husband drive you.
He had to go to the art shop of his employer, and he'd love to drop you.
Pierre, tell Maurice you'd love to drop him.
I'd love to drop you.
Get in.
Oh, that's fine.
Over here.
Thank you. Thank you. Oh, just like a millionaire.
A millionaire.
Oh no, look at that. I'm not going to drink that.

My hat.

- No, thank you, I can manage alone.
Oh. My ankle.
I think is better that you put your arms around me.
Would you think I put my arms around people I don't know?
My name is Maurice.
Oh, that's nothing.
- Is this ankle?
- No, it's quite unnecessary. - Don't stand on it yet.
- I'm sure it's better. No no no.

I often wonder.
No, I said, do you live down here?
I heard you.
I wonder if you can call it living...

They both want to go.

Now we can go on, Pierre.
Good old Pierre.
We can go on if I ever fix this car.
Princess.
Help. Help. Help.
Help. Help.
She's fainted again.
You know, I had an elder brother who used to faint quite often.
- He was a nip-omaniac.
- A what? A nip-omaniac.
He used to go around pinching things.
Oh, I had a friend like that. He used to pinch business girls in elevators. They had to send him to a cooler climate...
- No... I knew a girl...
- This is no time for reminiscences.
Get a couple of footmen to carry her upstairs.
But you gave the servants the afternoon off. Our footmen are playing football against the Old Soldiers Home.
Well, you two carry her upstairs. Someone fetch a doctor.
You carry her, I'll get the doctor.
Valentine, can you go for a doctor?
Certainly, bring him right in.
No, no, it's for Jeanette. She's fainted again.
Princess, permit me to introduce doctor Armand de Pertignac.
- Your Highness...
And now my dear, remove your dress.
- Your dress.
There's no occasion for distress.
- Is that necessary?
- Very. Yes.
As long as professional ethics apply, I'll see you with only a doctor's eye.
The doctor's eye is satisfied.
Now I'll hear your heart.
Don't sigh.
Nothing wrong here.
Now I'll take your pulse, my dear.
Perfectly regular, right on the tick.
Madam, oh Madam, you cannot be sick.
Then why do I lie awake in bed?
And why does blood rush to my head?

- Quite right, at night.
And why does music make me sad?
And why do love songs drive me mad?

It was a happiness of great peace.

Well doctor, we have planned an outing in the forest for this afternoon, but... I suppose we better call it off.
No, no; Go right ahead.
Oh, then Jeanette is not in any danger? Well, nothing immediate. But...
- Married? - Married?
To a man of her own age.
Ah, but the only two eligible men in France, the only two of rank equal to Her Highness are not exactly of my niece's age.
- How old are they?
- One is 85... and the other will be 12 on his next birthday.
- Well, this is a problem.
- What do you recommend?
Exercise... exercise... and exercise.
Exercise...
- This gives me new hope.
- Eh? About my chances of marrying Jeanette.
I'll ask her to consider me as a prescription.
My dear Count de Savignac, the only obstacle lies in the delicate matter of rank.
Jeanette demands a prince at least.
And you are not a prince.
Well I would've been if our family hadn't been badly gypped during the crusades.
Anyway, your grace mustn't forget the tenth Count de Sauvignac. What about him?
- Marie Antoinette?
- Positively.
- Now may I ask Jeanette?
- Yes, but not this afternoon.
Quite right. Of course, that's me, you know, always impetuous.
Monsieur...
Mademoiselle.. I'm looking for the Vicomte de Barres.
I didn't know he was expecting a friend.
- Are you alone?
- Alone?
- I mean in life.
You're not married?
- Ah, no.
I'll be right down.
Monsieur...
Who made that for you?
McClintock and Armstrong, Monsieur...
Of London. Might I recommend them for your own service?
Oh no, thank you.
I'm looking for the Vicomte des Barres.
- Possibly in the drawing room, Monsieur. - Thanks.
- Mesdames...
- Monsieur...
- His smile is so disarming.
- So grand. - So gay.
- So charming.
Mesdames...
We bore you with our sewing?
- Sewing?
- Quite so.
Oh no. A needle is magnetic.
- How true.
- And how poetic.
Oh no, no.
Never use silk on armor.
Flannel is the thing.
Oh, are you interested in armor? Any kind of wearing apparel.
- Is this your only job? - Oh no, I putter around.
Tell me, where can I find the Vicomte de Barres?
Oh, he's somewhere about. I hate him.
Imagine... he would like to tear down this beautiful chateau.
No, it would be better to tear down the Vicomte.
You're a man after my own heart.
- You have a soul.
- Someone looking for me?
- Ah, Monsieur Vicomte. - Maurice...
I came down about those...
My, my, how well you're looking.
You, you've met my uncle?
- Uncle?
- The, the, the Duke.
Oh yes, we had a little chat. He's the first of your friends who I haven't wanted to hit with a battle axe. - OH...
- He recommended flannel. Flannel?
Would you pardon us a moment, uncle?
Maurice, may I have a word with you?
Maurice, did you tell uncle about those bills?
But I didn't get a chance. And I didn't know he was your uncle.
Now, Vicomte, I brought all your clothes and I want the money.
See, it's 63,000 francs.
And I'm here also on behalf of my fellow creditors.
Put yourself in their place.
I'd like to.
It isn't anyone who can be a creditor nowadays.
Now, Maurice, I'm going to be frank with you.
Right now I can't pay you.
Ah, then I'll have to see the Duke.
He'll throw you out, he hates tradesmen.
He'll throw me out too, so what's the use?
I won't leave the chateau without my money.
Oh why do you say that.
Then stay here I'll have the money in a few days, I'll borrow it.
No no no, this is no place for me. - A tailor in a chateau.
- Well why not?
- No no, I'm going to see the Duke. - Oh, Maurice, please...
The charming young man.
I'm trying to persuade him to stay.
- Oh there you are.
Yes. And you been trying to persuade him to stay...
- No we really are... - Oh, you're staying. Jeanette.
Countess Emilia... let me present...
Gilbert, present your friend.
Yes yes, of course.
This is my good friend... Mauri... Eh, Baron Courtelain.
Yes, I've met the Baron.
We're trying to persuade him to stay. -
- Are we?
- The Baron must've changed.
He used to make very sudden decisions.
That Baron, eh?

- Hi, Count.
Your grace, with your permission, I'd like to do my hunting indoors today.
- Indoors? - In your library.
What the deuce? As much as I love a good gallop, I'm giving it up in your interest.
Yes, but why all this mystery?
Concerns the Baron. I've never heard of the Courtelains in all my historical research.
Have you? No, but I'm not as familiar as I might be with the nobility of the South.
I ran through 8 or 10 volumes before breakfast and found not a Courtelain.
Bless my soul.
Mind you, I still have 36 more volumes to look through before I'm sure.
Yes, but this fellow is a friend of Gilbert's.
Gilbert I need only remind you is none too choosy.
Well, you go right ahead, my boy.
Oh, well, Maurice.
You look great. Is that my new riding habit?
No no, not until you paid for it, Monsieur Vicomte.
I've been up since daybreak altering it to fit me.
Oh, I see... Have you picked out something good to ride on?
- The best I could get.
- Is it the big gray one?
No, small, orange, with black stripes.
Orange with black... What is it, a zebra?
No. A bicycle.
You can't use a bicycle in a hunt. You got to ride a horse.
No, but I've never been on a horse in my life.
Well Baron... I want to lend you a horse worthy of your line.
- Thunderbolt.
- Thunderbolt? - He's fast, but furious.
- Say, you better, I... I think I'd better not.
You see, the harder the horse, the harder I get.
- I might hurt Thunderbolt.
- Oh, he can take it.
Oh Baron. I took the liberty of choosing a horse for you.
Oh, that's so kind of you.
I won't need your Thunderbolt.
What's my horse's name?
- Solitude.
- Oh, Solitude.
- Well. Good hunting.
- Well, I'm set. Solitude sounds just my type.
You know why they call him Solitude?
Because he always come home alone.
Solitude for Baron Courtelain.
What's the point in giving the Baron a horse like that?
I want to test the Baron.
I can think of several better ways to do that, let me try.
Don't bother, tell me, you ever think of anything but men, dear?
- Oh, yes. - Like what? - Schoolboys.
I know that's Solitude.
No, that's only Thunderbolt.
There's Solitude.
Oh, Gilbert.
He's not going to... Oh Gilbert, don't let him.
Oh, Gilbert.
Stand back.
What is this?
This? This is oats, madame. Very wild.
And this is the stag. Very tired.
And where's Solitude?
We agreed to separate.
- He went home. Alone.
- And what are your plans?
Oh, very simple, madame.
After supper, the stag will go right to bed.
He's had a hard day.
And the hunt just stops, I suppose.
A very happy ending, madame. - Which we both approve.
- I do not approve.
No, no. I mean the stag and myself.
No true nobleman would mock the tradition of the hunt like this. There are things too fine, too sacred, to be made ridiculous.
Oh, your Highness is losing your temper.
I'm not losing my temper. You let that stag go.
No. He'd be caught and killed. You wouldn't want that, madame, look...
Look at those eyes.
You are not a gentleman.
You need some lessons.
And you, your Highness, are not a woman. You need some lessons too.
You know too much about hunting, etiquette, tradition... You know nothing about style... charm... love.
Your riding habit...
Look, you riding habit, it's not graceful, it's not in the mode. And your hair... It's too prim, madame.
It's to severe.
Please let me be judge that...
But your riding habit...
It's discouraging.
- What are you doing now?
- I'm thinking... I'm thinking about you without these clothes.
Open your eyes, at once.
Oh no, pardon, madame. I mean, with different clothes.
- Smart clothes. - Here they are...
- The clothes?
- The hunt.
What's the meaning of this?
- The stag, the stag, he's asleep.
Shh. We must go back, he's very tired.
Go back, go back. Quickly and quietly.
Go back.
Quickly and quietly.
On tiptoe. On tiptoe.
Oh, madame.
Good hunting?
No luck. The Baron and the deer made friends and called the whole thing off.
Well I've had good hunting. There's no such title as Baron de Courtelain.
What? Gilbert, did you hear that?
I've even been through the better class illegitimates.
- And still no Courtelain?
- Not a Courtelain.
Now Gilbert... who the deuce is your friend?
Well, uncle, I don't think I'd better tell you. - It wouldn't be safe.
- Wouldn't be safe?
You see, I owe Maurice something...
You owe him something?
Uncle, you shouldn't keep repeating everything I say. - You live the life of an echo.
- Will you kindly come to the point.
Uncle... we live in an age of toppling thrones... of uneasy crowns, of persecuted royalty compelled at times to travel under strange names. Right?
Are you trying to hint that your friend is... royalty?
He has the Hapsburg lip.
And the name... Baron Courtelain is...
A mere nom de pullman.
Well, we're all here except the Baron.
Good, then we're all here. Count, could you do something to entertain?
No, I'm helpless since my accident.
- Accident?
- I fell flat on my flute.
Ah, Emperor.
Have you seen Valentine, uncle?
Why no, she's not here either. The Baron and Valentine are both missing.
You know uncle, it's dangerous to invite guests with a girl like that around.
- Ah, there you are.
The Baron will be down in a moment.
He had to send to Paris for his costume, It was late getting here.
- I've been watching him put it on.
- You've been what?
It's all right, uncle, she has the room next to Maurice. And she's bored holes in the connecting door.
Valentine?
Are you aware that...?
Are you...
Are you... Now...
Are you aware that that door come down to us through generations?
So have my instincts.
Hey, she had you there, unc.
Will you stop blowing that infernal bladder?
Thank you, madame.
- Oh, how original.
- Thank you, madame. - Oh, how intriguing.
- Thank you, madame.
How common.
Do you find my costume out of place, madame?
Decidedly.
Maybe you're right. An Apache among all these nobility.
And yet I understand an Apache wanting to come. - Where there is beauty and light.
- Yes, But people should be on guard against him.
You don't like the Apache, eh?
I dislike his attitude toward women.
Oh madame, you do not understand the Apache.
He's not always such a bad fellow.
I'd like to tell you what he really feels.
- I'd love to know.
- And I... am not interested.
Are they always so brutal with girls?
- Haven't they any weak moments?
- How do they live?
I'll tell you the story of one who I have known.

I brought you over here because I want you.
Oh, Countess.
I want you to keep as far away from me as possible.
Countess, I'll try.
Pardon me, Countess, something I must do. Some place I must go.
Princess. open your eyes, Princess. Open your eyes.
No. Don't open your eyes.
Sleep. So I can tell you how beautiful you are. How beautiful...
How dare you.
Wait...
- Why did you do that?
- Because I love you.
You... you kissed me, Princess.
I love you, Maurice.
You... you love me?
I thought against it, I was afraid.
Oh, my darling... how foolish I was.
- Perhaps you were wise.
Fear is a warning, Princess.
I don't understand you, Maurice.
Let me dream this dream a little longer.
When I wake... I'll go away.
Go away?
- Don't you want me, Maurice?
- I want you, my Princess.
But... I have wanted the moon too.
Look, my hands are empty.
Your arms need ever be empty of me, Maurice.
We have found each other in darkness. Like ships that come into harbor together, at night.
When morning comes... one's there... one sails away.
We'll sail together... or stay together.
I love you, my beautiful Princess.
This, I can tell you, this is mine.
- Jeanette...
You don't know who I am.
You're you... and I love you.
But... if I...
If I were not... what you think I am.
- If I...
- Whoever you are...
Whatever you are...
Wherever you are... I love you.
Jeanette, you know what I think?
I think I'm mad.
And that you are mad.
And that the whole world is mad.
But I'm luckiest man of all. And the happiest.
Listen, my beautiful Princess.
I love you. I love you.
And whatever comes tomorrow...
Love me tonight. Love me tonight.
"Whoever you are... whatever you are..." "Wherever you are...
I love you".
"Oh, my Princess..."
"You don't know who I am.
I am a tailor."
"A tailor? A tailor.
Isn't it romantic."
"Oh, I love you."
♪ Your heart and my heart were made to meet... ♪
♪ Don't make them wait, love me tonight. ♪
♪ Why should our lips be afraid to meet. ♪
♪ Love me tonight. ♪
♪ Who knows what tomorrow brings with the morning light. ♪

♪ Love me tonight... ♪
Let me see.
There, it's superb.
- You sent for me, Princess?
Yes?
I'd like your advice on my new riding habit.
- Beautiful.
- Do you really think so?
Perfect.
How about the length?
Divine...
Here, look at it more closely.
The closer I get, the more perfect.
Monsieur has taste.
- How about the color?
- Lucky color.
- Anything wrong?
- Oh, certainly. The color rides up.
- Oh no, that won't do at all.
- You think so, Monsieur?
Oh yes, madame, yes.
And look, it's too tight here, madame.
It's too tight across the chest.
And the lapels, the lapels, they're too stiff.
No, no, really.
The whole thing lacks smartness, youth, grace.
- No, no, no...
- Oh, Maurice... Your Highness, I have never been so insulted.
With your permission, I'm going.
Madame Pituar, madame Pituar...
Maurice, what am I going to do now?
Don't worry, Jeanette.
We'll fix it.
No, no...
That's not possible...
We'll make you a riding habit... that will tame Solitude.
But how?
The important thing... is not to hurry.
What's the matter?
- I have never been so insulted in my life.
- Who insulted you?
- Madame Pituar has been insulted.
- At her age?
Remarkable.
Some men have no taste.
- The old girl must have something.
Shh. Let us look into this.
- A scandal.
- An outrage.
- I'll shoot this.
- Oh, let me die.
No, let me explain.
I was only fixing the Princess's riding habit.
- Uncle, uncle, that's the truth.
- Preposterous.
- I give you my word of honor.
I tell why the Baron often gives people advice about their clothes.
Be quiet.
What you say is insulting. - I'll run him through for this.
- You've already shot him.
Silence.
- Silence. - Silence.
I'll prove I'm telling the truth.
Give me two hours and I'll remodel this riding habit.
Alright.
I'll convict you by your own falsehood.
- I'll give you two hours, sir.
- Yeah, he'll do it.
- I'll bet he can't do it.
- I'll bet you 10,000 francs he can.
- I'll bet you 50,000 he's a liar.
- Your done. Your grace, time flies.
Quite right.
Leave them alone, everybody.
- I'll give you two hours, sir.
- 50,000 francs, now, eh?
- Maurice, what will you do now?
- You'll see. Two hours to go.
Wait a minute... now... and this...
Now I start.
Twenty two.
Twenty eight.
How do you like it?
Oh, it's perfect.
Of course, if I had more time...
Too perfect.
Tell me, How were you able to make this habit in 2 hours? How were you able to make it at all?
Because I am a tailor...
- What?
- A tailor.
Oh Maurice, you're joking.
No. I'm not a baron...
I am a tailor.
Does that make so much difference?
A tailor...
Last night... you said to me...
Whoever you are...
Whatever you are... Wherever you are, I love you.
Jeanette, what happened?
Why, Baron, what happened?
I just told her I'm not a baron. I'm a tailor.
- A tailor?
- Yes, a tailor.
Help. Help.
The Baron. He's not a baron.
He's a tailor.
- The Baron, - he's not a baron.
What do you know about this?
Well I, I. - You see, I owed him some bills.
- Bills?
I'll deal with you later.
But first I'll get Flammand to give this tradesman his money and kick him out.
A cane.
A cane.

Stop the train.
I'm going with you. Oh no, Your Highness forgets I'm a tailor.
I can't live without you.
I love you, but you couldn't be a tailor's wife.
I could and I will.
Stop the train.
No, I love you too much.
You belong to the chateau, Goodbye.
- Stop the train.
- What happened?
I love him.
- That's not a railroad problem.
- Stop this train.
Move Jeanette, move.
Come, darling, come...
Once upon a time there was a Princess and a Prince Charming...
- Who was not a prince.
- But who was charming.
And they lived happily ever after...
- Sir Lionel Barton, sir.
- Oh, yes, show him in. Show him in.
Come in, sir.
Well, Nayland, what's up?
Well, Lionel, before we go into that, I want to ask you a very funny question.
- Do you love your country?
All through the war and the Depression and the high taxes and the low rents.
I shall never love another.
Well, Lionel, the British government is asking you to risk your life again.
- Oh, very well.
- All right then.
After you leave here, you're going to the British Museum to meet some friends of yours.
How the deuce did you know all that?
It's my business to know things.
Lionel, you must find that tomb.
We can't allow for any failure, and you must be the first to find it.
Why all the hurry?
- You know Fu Manchu?
He's trying to find it, too.
Oh, I didn't know he was an archaeologist.
Oh, no, he's not. He's insane for power.
- What do you expect to find in that tomb?
- Records, the golden plate with the threat of Genghis Khan to return, the golden mask he wore and the famous golden scimitar.
Of course, in your hands, these things will be merely interesting archaeological specimens to go into the British Museum.
But should Fu Manchu put that mask across his wicked eyes and take that scimitar into his bony, cruel hands, all Asia rises.
He'll declare himself Genghis Khan come to life again, and he'll lead hundreds of millions of men to sweep the world.
And that, my friend, is what you have got to prevent.
You must find that grave.
You must be the first to find it, and you must bring those pretty things back to England.
Of course it's genuine.
Don't you know that the Equus polydactylous, Anchitherium,
Coryphodon, Equus sivalensis:
But you forget, Equus asiaticus, Equus przewalskii,
Equus lebii, Equus chenensis, Hipparion and...
Sir Lionel not here yet?
No, Von Berg.
It's a funny time to call a meeting.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I'd hoped to have a long talk, but something's come up that's altered my plans slightly.
Fairgyle, I want two of your men.
My two old friends, Von Berg and McLeod.
- Another expedition?
- I was just getting bored with London.
- Can I have them?
- I think you have them already.
Where do we go now?
Well, perhaps I can best answer your question by first telling you that I think I've discovered the buried tomb of Genghis Khan.
- This can't be so!
Frankly, Barton, I don't believe it.
You always dreamt of this dead raider.
Carnarvon made his dream come true.
Think of what he found in Egypt.
I don't care what it is.
I go with you.
Where do we go?
We move secretly.
So it's a toil over these mountains into this valley here.
Then up again and over this range of hills, and right here, on the edge of the Gobi Desert, that's where we camp.
Now, I want you to understand the truth.
From the moment we start, we're in great danger.
There's a fanatic in the East, Dr. Fu Manchu.
- And we have to beat him.
- A Chinaman beat me? He couldn't do it.
Thanks, old friend.
Then we meet again on Sunday to arrange all details.
Get away by Monday.
Thank you a thousand times.
I think I can promise you some great acquisitions for the museum.
That'll be fine, Barton, fine.
Thanks once again.
See you on Sunday night, Doctor.
Terry, I just don't think I can stand this any longer.
Steady, Sheila.
A whole week not knowing whether he's alive or...
I say, do you know where Commissioner Smith is?
- We've been waiting nearly 20 minutes.
- Good morning, Vernon.
Sheila, sorry I'm late.
- Hello, Terry.
- Hello, Nayland.
I brought Terry along.
Have you heard anything?
If I knew anything, I'd tell you.
Excuse me.
Sit down. Sit down, Sheila.
I'll be with you in just a moment.
Sheila, you've got to be very brave.
Oh, Nayland, I won't believe my father's dead.
No, no, no, neither will I.
I've just come from a conference with Von Berg and McLeod.
Fine chaps, those men. Depend on them.
Oh, come to the point.
You're keeping something back from me.
Sheila, did you ever hear of a Dr. Fu Manchu?
Yes, I've heard Father speak of him to the men.
I remember I couldn't sleep at nights thinking of the terrible...
Nayland, don't tell me that man has anything to do with this.
That my father has been taken by...
You know what they say about him in the East, his cruelty, his unspeakable tortures.
- Nayland, he'll kill him, I know!
- Oh, no, no, Sheila.
- I know he won't do that.
- What does he want of him?
Well, he wants the secret about the tomb of Genghis Khan, and, naturally, he turned to your father.
You think they can make him talk.
They can't.
I know him better than you.
- She's right, sir.
They have ways in the East of shattering the strongest courage.
That's why McLeod and Von Berg have agreed to carry on with the expedition, to finish the job of getting to the tomb before Fu Manchu.
- I'm going with Dr. Von Berg.
- Sheila, that's no place for a woman.
You think I'll crack under it, but I won't.
My father would hate me if I did.
I know much more about the tomb than they do.
I know where it's located.
I can save them days.
Don't you see?
Every second counts.
- Sheila.
- It's no use.
- Sheila, I protest.
- I tell you it's no use.
The Englishman is here.
And tell my daughter I want to see her.
- I want to know the meaning of this.
- Sit there.
You'll answer my question.
Sit there.
Can you remember much of what has happened in the past week, Sir Lionel?
I was attacked in the British Museum, drugged, of course.
I think I was under the influence of drugs for days.
Then I was in a plane.
Now I'm here.
You're Fu Manchu, aren't you?
I'm a Doctor of Philosophy from Edinburgh.
I'm a Doctor of Law from Christ's College.
I'm a Doctor of Medicine from Harvard.
My friends out of courtesy call me Doctor.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Well, Three Times Doctor, what do you want of me?
I have sent for you to make your fortune.
What good are these relics of a dead warrior to you?
Oh, our English people like to look at them on holidays.
Are they worth a million pounds to you?
My dear fellow, I can't sell what I haven't got.
But you will tell me where they are, for money, I mean.
Not for anything in the world.
- Did you send for me, my father?
Explain to this gentleman the rewards that might be his.
Point out to him the delights of our lovely country, the promise of our beautiful women.
Even my daughter. Even that for you.
Fu Manchu, I'm not for sale.
You've read about this, Barton, the torture of the bell.
Minute after minute.
Hour after hour.
Day after day.
Seems harmless, doesn't it?
Just a bell ringing.
But the percussion and the repercussion of sound against your eardrums will soften and destroy them until the sound is magnified a thousand times.
You can't move.
You can't sleep.
You will be frantic with thirst.
You will be unspeakably foul.
But here you will lie day after day, until you tell.
You'll be hanged!
Oh, Himmel:
Much more of this, and I won't have no hands left.
Why, we haven't even started, Doctor.
Just wait till we get in the tomb and start to dig out the jolly old skeleton himself.
We've been lucky at that, Von Berg.
We haven't been bothered by any curious Chinamen.
Quite right, Mac, and I hope the same good luck continues when we find it.
If we do.
Aren't you hungry?
Just nod your head, and I'll feed you.
Do you want it? Well?
But I won't talk.
I won't talk.
- Mac, I believe I've hit it!
- Let me see.
Come on, everybody, dig.
Oh, look!
The seal of Genghis Khan!
- Sheila!
Sheila!
- Shovel.
He'd be proud of you, Sheila, mighty proud.
Oh, hurry.
Sheila, it looks like it runs over this way now.
Rest and quiet.
Now for a nice, long drink.
I forgot to tell you it was salt.
Fiend.
Barton.
- Fresh water.
- Fresh food. - No.
- And a bath.
- Sleep.
- Sleep, Barton, sleep.
- Day in, day out, sleep.
Now, tell me.
Tell me.
- Well, who goes in first?
- Terry. He found the slab.
Age before beauty.
Think of it, Sheila, we're the first to enter the tomb of the great Genghis Khan.
It's overwhelming.
I can hardly believe it.
It just staggers my imagination.
Aye, and you're standing in the first unplundered tomb of a king that died nearly 700 years ago.
Solid gold.
Enough to pay a king's ransom.
And sealed with the seal of Genghis Khan.
Terry, give me your knife.
Remember the curse on Tutankhamen's tomb?
All the people connected with it died soon after its opening.
That's a lot of bosh.
Silly superstitions.
They would have died...
What's it say, Doctor?
"May the curse of the Gods descend upon him
"and his forever
"who dares enter herein. "
I don't like to mar the beauty of these doors, but I have my orders.
It's got to be done.
- Mac, give me the ax.
- I'm afraid of this.
- That curse.
Those hideous faces.
Now, Sheila, pull yourself together.
Your father would have done the same things if he was here.
Mac, save those pieces.
- The greatest fighter of them all.
As powerful in death as he was in life.
Countless hordes still worship in his name.
- Well, come on, let's go to work.
- Righto.
You know, I have a feeling that the sooner we get these relics in the hands of Sir Nayland, the sooner we'll have news of your father, Sheila.
Look out, Terry.
Oh, that's all right, darling.
Just a friendly little tarantula.
I have brought you here for great tidings.
I am the most unfortunate of men.
I have no son to follow me.
Therefore, in shame, I ask you to receive a message from my ugly and insignificant daughter.
Speak, my daughter.
I have seen a vision.
The prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
Genghis Khan, masked in his plate of gold, bearing the scimitar that none but he could ever wield comes back to us.
I've seen a vision of countless hordes swarming to recapture the world.
I've seen the victorious.
I've heard the shouts of the dead and the dying drowned by the victorious cries of our people,
"Genghis Khan comes back.
"Genghis Khan leads the East against the world! "
- Well, Mac.
- Well, it's my old friend Smith.
Nayland!
This is a surprise.
- Sir Nayland!
- He's looking fine, isn't he?
Oh, Nayland.
What of my father?
We'll talk about that later, Sheila.
Take her in the house, Terrence.
- Wait a minute, darling.
I'll strike a light.
- No, no, don't. Don't do that.
Bring all that stuff in here as quietly as you can and stow it over there.
Oh, Nayland, please, please.
Tell me about my father.
Nothing.
Pretty inadequate report, isn't it, Sheila?
- What are we going to do?
- I'm doing everything I can.
We can't find Fu Manchu, although we do know he's around here and very near.
So if I can get all of you and this stuff out of the country, then I can deal with him. He'll show his hands.
Well, look, Nayland, if you think he's around here, why do we have to leave the country until we find him?
Young man, your business is to obey orders.
And I'll have you all out of the country by tomorrow,
- every one of you.
- Oh, why?
Because I'm worried.
I don't like the looks of it.
Why can't we have a little light, Nayland?
Because this house has got to appear empty as it has been for months.
It's our only safety.
- So understand.
No lights.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Miss Sheila, off to bed with you.
Come along and I'll show you where your room is.
They all open off this courtyard, and yours is here.
So, this is what we've been fighting for.
That's what we came for.
And they believe in a bauble like that.
Will we ever understand these Eastern races?
Will we ever learn anything?
Well, we'll have to take turns watching this thing tonight.
McLeod, you take the first four hours.
No, I'll stay up all night.
Then I'll know everything's all right.
- But I'm going to lock you in.
- Good night, Mac.
Terrence, open the door.
- Good night, McLeod.
- Good night, Smith.
McLeod.
He was black.
But he didn't take it.
He didn't...
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
I don't want to be abrupt, but we've got to get down to brass tacks.
Now, understand, no one leaves this compound today.
You travel tonight.
But we've been traveling for days without rest.
- We can't do it, Nayland.
- You must.
So, Sheila, you go to your room and sleep until I call you.
Have no fear.
We're watching over you.
You get all the sleep you can.
Von Berg, you better get some rest also.
Terry, you take the first watch.
Bolt that door, Terry.
See here, Nayland, we're done in.
Exhausted.
We can't go tonight.
Why, think of Sheila.
She's the one I am thinking of.
Do you suppose for a moment Fu Manchu doesn't know we have a beautiful white girl here with us?
He wants the sword and mask.
Suppose he takes them?
- Suppose he takes Sheila also?
We're in the enemy's country now.
And a wise enemy.
We're fighting a thing we can't understand with everything against us.
That's why you've got to get Sheila and those relics
- into a place of safety tonight.
- You really think he knows about Sheila?
- He knows everything.
He knows every move we make. His spies are all around us.
I can't even trust our own coolies.
Someone's watching us.
Now, just pull yourself together, laddie.
Pull yourself together. Got a revolver?
I'll go out and look over the camels and pick out the ones I think are fit to make the dash tonight.
Don't you go in that tower room.
I'll be back in a moment.
- Good afternoon, my friend.
A message from my master, Dr. Fu Manchu.
