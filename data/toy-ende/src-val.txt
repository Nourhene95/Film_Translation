I just want to know one thing.
Is Sir Lionel alive?
But what makes you think not?
- Does that mean that he's dead?
- But of course not.
My master's quite excelled at surgery, and a little accident...
What's your message?
My master would very much like a certain sword and mask.
Your fianc√©e is very fond of her father, I believe.
- I'm thinking about that.
- Terry!
Is it nothing to know that your father is well?
- Oh, where is he?
- Fu Manchu's got him.
Is he all right?
Look out, Terry.
This may be a trick.
There is unfortunately a certain amount of evidence to the contrary.
Oh, it's not your father's.
It's a cheap trick to try to scare us.
- Perhaps you would like other evidence. - No.
That's enough.
Terry, wait.
I shall expect to see you with the sword and mask
- at the shop of Goy Lo Sung.
In the street of the dragon, half a league to the north.
Otherwise, I'm afraid if your father does return, he may not be in the best of health.
- Where are those things?
- Oh, Sheila, we can't.
- Wait a minute, dear.
Don't you see it's betraying the whole expedition?
- I'm going to that place.
- Oh, you couldn't. You can't.
Oh, Terry, don't you see?
If it were someone you loved.
My father, who'd do anything for you.
- I know, dear.
But listen to...
- Terry, if you won't go, I'll go myself.
You can't let them do this to him.
You can't let him suffer.
We'll get the sword back somehow.
Nayland will manage.
Nayland would do this himself.
Anyone would.
You mustn't say a word to Nayland.
- But you are going?
- You're Fu Manchu?
- Please sit down so that we can enjoy your visit.
Now, tell me.
What can one so poor as Dr. Fu Manchu do for you?
You know why I'm here.
This is the sword and mask of Genghis Khan.
Your messenger said that if I brought you these, you'd release Sir Lionel.
Release?
Why, my dear young friend, Sir Lionel is my guest, not my prisoner.
But if I could see the sword and mask.
Genghis Khan.
- You trick Fu Manchu?
- That's the sword we found in the tomb.
Lies, you cursed son of a white dog!
I'll flay you for this!
I tell you, I didn't know.
Those relics were found in the tomb.
- The whips!
- Listen to me!
I tell you, I didn't know that sword was a fake.
I swear to you I didn't.
The whips!
Let him down.
Untie him.
He is not entirely unhandsome, is he, my father?
For a white man, no.
May I suggest, however, a slight delay in your customary procedure?
- You have further need of him?
He shall still be the means of discovering for me where they have hidden the sword and mask.
And for that purpose
- you will...
I don't see why they're not here.
- Patience, my dear. We must wait.
- I won't wait. I can't.
I can't imagine where Terry's gone.
Sheila, you sure you don't know?
I've told you I don't know.
- Nayland.
I'm sorry, Sheila, but why don't you tell me the truth?
Let me go to him.
No, let me go.
I gave her enough of this so she'll sleep till morning.
She should have told me.
- I might have saved her father.
- Why did Fu kill him?
Reprisal.
He found out that the other sword was a counterfeit.
- It was a fake?
I had it made from an old engraving I found in the British Museum.
That's why I left at a later date.
I intended to use those relics to buy Sir Lionel from Fu Manchu.
- I would have brought him back alive.
- What will he do to Terry?
Nothing, just now.
He realizes that I have the genuine sword.
You changed them the night McLeod was killed.
Sheila said that Terry had gone to the Bazaar of Goy Lo Sung.
As I remember, that's the sing-song shop in a place known as the House of Ten Thousand Joys.
- You are going there?
I'm sure that it leads to Fu Manchu.
And, Von Berg, if I don't return in 24 hours, you take that mask and sword and Sheila to Peking.
And don't come looking for me.
And don't pay any attention to anything you hear about me or from me till I get back.
And don't you let her out of your sight.
I'm going to need it if I meet Fu Manchu.
See something?
Ming Dynasty.
Ming.
- Too small.
- Small?
More big?
I get.
What I really want is a little comfort.
A little rest.
Pleasant dreams, perhaps?
Not for white man.
Honorable.
Nice bed, sir.
You can load?
Nicely dream.
The slightest move will send a bullet crashing through your stiff British spine.
Are you in the habit of shooting your enemies in the back?
Put your gun away.
You may turn around.
Now, that's better.
Now we can talk like gentlemen.
- Now, what do you want?
- You know what I want.
I want Terry Granville, and I want him alive.
At the moment, he's being entertained by my beautiful daughter.
Rot!
Would you like to see him?
Talk to him?
- Permit me.
Is this a friend of your family's?
It's not wise to insult your host, Sir Nayland.
If it were not the easy way out, I would kill you now.
If you please.
Permit me.
My most modest daughter.
Sir Nayland Smith of the British Secret Service.
- Terry, Terry.
- What have you done to this boy?
- Practically nothing, as yet.
What are you going to do to him?
Merely inject a drop of serum into his blood.
- That will either kill him or drive him mad?
The injection of the serum will make his brain mine.
In other words, he becomes a reflection of my will.
He will do as I command exactly as though I were doing it.
- So much better than hypnotism.
Another of your Oriental tricks.
In the name of the British government, I demand the release of this boy.
British government?
- And he will bring them to me.
- You'll never make him do that.
Why, my dear Sir Nayland Smith, I will show you the sword myself just before I dispatch you to your cold, saintly Christian paradise.
See that he is quite comfortable, for the present.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- I'm not afraid of your poisons.
- Not poison.
You will do as I command.
You will think as I think, see as I see, and do as I command.
Dr. Von Berg.
- It's I, Terrence.
Oh, Terry.
Terry, my darling, I thought you were never coming back.
What have they done to you?
You look so tired.
I'm back. I'm here.
Terry, dear, you seem dazed, as if you'd been drugged.
Where's Sir Nayland?
What about him?
He's all right. He's waiting for us in Nankow.
- Nankow?
- But you must get into bed, Terry.
- You need sleep, dear.
No, we must leave at once.
- He wants us to bring the mask and sword.
- He?
You mean Nayland?
Yes. Yes, he's taking us to Peking.
Oh, that's impossible.
He would never leave in this storm.
He says we must leave.
He says the storm gives us our best chance.
But, Terry, why didn't Nayland come with you?
- Yes, he told us to wait.
- He's preparing a secret escort to Peking.
That's why he sent me.
He says we're to bring only the mask and sword.
Well, he must know what he's doing.
Sheila, you go and get dressed.
- We leave at once.
Close that door.
Keep Terry here.
I can't explain it,
- but there's something I'm afraid of.
This just isn't Terry.
Of course it's Terry.
Come on, get dressed, Sheila.
Come on, Terry.
Hold it, listen to me.
You're not yourself.
I know you're not.
Oh, please, don't go tonight, I beg of you.
Wait until morning.
- He can't wait.
- No, Terry.
I'm afraid of you.
I don't understand. Terry.
I'm afraid.
I don't understand you, Terry.
You're all changed.
Please, I'm not going.
I tell you, I won't go.
Come on, Terry.
He wants you, Terry.
- There it is.
- Give it to me.
Oh, don't.
- Stop. - Yeah.
Look, Sheila, that isn't Terry.
- It's an evil spirit.
- He's possessed.
Possessed.
Fu Manchu, I want to tell you that the British government...
It is my pleasure to show you how I entertain my guests.
You, Miss Barton, will be taken to the room of the golden peacock, where you will be prepared for a sacrifice to our Gods.
And you... You, my dear Doctor, will follow my slaves to the room of the slim silver fingers, where I am sure you will be more than comfortable.
It will be your honor to be the first white martyrs to perish at the hands of the new Genghis Khan.
Listen, you...
Terrence, do something. Help, Sheila.
Help!
Do something.
You hideous yellow monster.
You've got your cursed sword and mask.
What more can you want of us?
- Do you want to destroy us all?
This is only the beginning.
I will wipe out your whole accursed white race.
It's Sheila.
It's Sheila talking to you.
I love you, Terry.
You've been sick.
You've been through a bad dream.
A bad dream, Terry.
But you're going to waken.
You're going to waken now.
My darling, they can't hurt you.
Put your arms around me, Terry.
Sheila, Sheila.
Sheila.
You silly little fool.
Lying to yourself.
Believing that you had his love, when he was only drugged by this beast!
- Take them away.
You...
Listen, Sheila, I know what they did to me.
Always remember that.
At the third stroke of the gong, have the slaves take her to the temple.
- Great honor is yours, Miss Barton.
- I am ready.
Oh, my child, you must not be impatient.
Great as I am about to become, I still cannot hasten the course of the sun.
- Will it be soon?
And am I to be allowed to see my friends again?
I am afraid you would not entirely enjoy what you saw.
- Is Terrence...
- It seems that my daughter has conceived a romantic interest in this young man.
Men of Asia, our skies are red with the thunderbolts of Genghis Khan.
They rain down on the white race and burn them.
The sacrifice to our Gods!
Would you all have maidens like this for your wives?
Then conquer and breed.
Kill the white man and take his women.
Give us the sign!
Our war eagles scream.
The splendor of the world is yours.
Here it is, and that's the machine.
See what's beneath it.
Von Berg, this should send out a million volts.
It will.
I saw it.
Terry, you hurry.
Get to Sheila.
We'll cover you with this.
In the blood of Shiva's bride, I baptize this sword.
Are you sure it's necessary, Nayland?
Father would so much have wanted to have it in the museum.
I'm very sorry, my dear.
As much as I respect your father's memory, we can't afford to take any chances.
There may be other Fu Manchus in the future.
By golly, after all that's happened, I wouldn't be surprised to see the hand of that fellow Fu Manchu get out of the ocean and grab it.
I don't think there's much danger of that.
Well, Genghis Khan, wherever you are, here's your...
Did you hear it?
You aren't, by any chance, a doctor of philosophy?
Law?
- Medicine?
- I don't think so, sir.
But are you sure?
Oh, yes, very sure.
- I congratulate you.
Well, as I was saying, wherever you are, Genghis Khan, I give you back your sword.
Silly people.
I don't like that fellow with the little mustache.
Up and at that mustache, men!
(CHUCKLES) Got him.
Now that I know you love me, how about letting me drive you home, huh?
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I didn't know anyone was out here.
May I?
I'm a little drunk.
Will you excuse me?
I think everyone here is a little drunk, but I'll excuse you.
Do you know who the gentleman was that tried to kiss you just now?
That was Damery, you know, the gossip columnist, the glassup columlist, the newspaper fellow.
If you'd let him kiss you, you'd probably have read about it in tomorrow's paper.
I wouldn't have liked that.
Wouldn't you like a little drink?
Drinking isn't one of my many vices.
Well, personally, I'm going to stop drinking next Tuesday afternoon at 3:00 sharp. (LAUGHS)
That make you feel better?
Much.
Enough better so that we may introduce ourselves?
I'm Jerry Corbett.
Does the name terrify you?
I didn't mean to look so stupid, but I never miss reading your column.
You write very cleverly.
Oh, yes, I'm so clever that I'm one of the few drinking newspapermen who can still hold his job.
As a matter of fact, I've almost finished a play.
Well, you shouldn't have gotten me started on the subject of myself because I can go on and on for hours.
Supposing you tell me who you happen to be.
Just a girl named Joan Prentice.
That means you are somebody.
It means you're the daughter of the gentleman who made millions putting things into tin cans that people like me take out of tin cans.
I see you believe in signs.
Mmm-hmm. And all the signs point to three stars.
Wouldn't you like to come over here and sit down?
It's cozier, and then, too, the drinks are handier.
Been having a good time tonight?
I'm a little disappointed.
I expected to meet a lot of interesting people and talk to them.
Most of them are too drunk to talk intelligently or else they insult you.
Bob Noble's parties are always like this, except that you don't often see such awfully fine hands.
Long, slender and artistic, and a diamond ring the size of a small potato on the right little finger.
Awfully fine head, hair like an Indian, fine, chiseled features, clean-cut as a tomahawk.
Say, now I feel like singing.
Do you mind? I don't know. Wait until I hear you.
It'll be too late then.
(SINGING) First she gave me gingerbread And then she gave me cake
And then she gave me creme de menthe for meeting her at the gate
(GIGGLING) Sing some more.
I like that one. Do you?
I like you, too, Joanie.
I think you're nice.
Thanks. You mean, of course, alcoholically speaking.
No, really. I think you're swell.
I like your hands.
Gosh, they're swell.
Why'd I let you do that?
Because I think you're swell.
What's your name, Joan?
My name's Joan.
I mean your telephone number.
Bittersweet 8100.
Come and have tea tomorrow at 5:00.
Hey, I'll be there early, and I'll stay late.
You'll never remember to come.
Sure I will.
It's late, Joan.
Don't go, Joanie.
Stay and we'll sing a thousand songs.
I got millions of them. Don't go.
Do we have to go, Greg?
I'd rather.
I want to get out to the club early tomorrow.
I'll get my wrap.
I don't believe we've met.
My name's Corbett. What's yours?
Gregory Boleslavsky.
Hey, now wait a minute.
I asked you a civil question, and I expect a civil answer.
You want a drink?
No, thanks.
No? Well, that's right, don't.
It's a rotten bottle, and it's a rotten label, and it's rotten whiskey.
No one should drink it.
Go on, get out of here.
He is a good reporter, but a very terrible tap dancer.
Our city editor says I'm a good tap dancer, but a very terrible reporter.
All ready?
Yes. Just a minute, Greg.
Good night, Mr. Corbett.
Well, merrily we go to hell.
You know Jerry Corbett, the boy I met last night?
Only what you told me at breakfast.
Yes, and I thought he wouldn't call, but he did, and he's coming to my party this afternoon.
You sure he won't disappoint you again?
I tell you, he's coming.
Yes, Miss Joan.
Benson, have we gingerbread, cake and creme de menthe in the house?
We have cake and cr√©me de menthe.
I don't know about the gingerbread.
Well, I want all three served at tea.
Yes, Miss Joan.
(GIGGLING) What is it?
Everything's heavenly.
And then she gave me cr√©me de menthe for meeting her at the gate
I said about 5:00, and he said he'd be here then.
I wouldn't worry about a young man who hasn't any manners and quite obviously no taste.
I've no use for him from now on.
I'm afraid I won't have any use for your Jerry Corbett if ever I have the pleasure of meeting him.
I guess you'll never have that pleasure.
Goodbye, Charlcie.
Goodbye, Joan.
I'll see you to your car?
You're nothing but an old rou√©.
We didn't have any customers for our gingerbread and cr√©me de menthe, Miss Joan.
Does one ring a bell or just walk in here?
It all depends on whether or not one is on time.
I have an idea you're Mr. Jerry Corbett.
Yeah. Yes, have we met before?
I never wait more than five minutes for anyone.
If you step inside I'll tell Joan you're here.
If you'll wait in there, please. Thank you.
Don't tell me you walk on this floor.
Sometimes it turns into a roller coaster right beneath your feet.
Perhaps we'd better sit down. Thank you.
Father tells me he met you at the door.
Do you know, I think your father's in love with me.
Because he seemed upset when he saw me, and it's always love that upsets a man, you know.
Some of the biggest and littlest men in history have been upset by love.
I was one of the big men, of course, when it happened to me.
By the way, am I a little late?
I'd like to have had you here for the party, but it really doesn't matter.
I think you're swell.
I'm beginning to think you do.
You told me that last night.
Well, just to prove that I still think so, would you like to take a little drive with me and have dinner somewhere?
I'd love to.
Perhaps I ought to explain that my car is yellow and has a meter on it.
I have a car. Well, I didn't mean that we... I did.
Let's go now.
I guess I didn't know you walked on these floors because most of the floors I know have sawdust on them.
(CHUCKLES) A gentleman wouldn't advertise he was kissing a lady.
I was advertising the finest of Prentice products.
That reminds me, it's high time I bought you something to eat.
Neither am I.
Do you always make love to girls when you take them for a drive?
I don't often take them for a drive.
I'm afraid, as a rule, I prefer the company of men, particularly if they're bartenders.
You see, I figured out a long time ago that a punch in the nose heals much quicker than a broken heart.
Don't tell me you're a woman-hater.
I just don't think about them very much.
You thought about one once.
I mean, you said something before we left the house about having once been upset by a woman.
Now, how can one so young have the memory of a 200-year-old elephant?
I just happen to remember.
Matter of fact, I was upset by a woman once.
A couple of years ago.
What was her name? Claire.
Claire Hempstead.
Whatever became of her?
She's on the stage.
She's been just as successful there as she was with me.
Have you any pictures of her?
Yeah, I got an old one hanging in my room.
Do you ever look at it?
Once every blue moon.
Say, what is this, anyway, an inquisition?
No, I guess I'm a little jealous.
Well, don't be.
I don't blame Claire 'cause any girl would be a fool to marry a man like me.
Joan, if I haven't said so before, I want to tell you now.
You're swell.
You know, Miss Claire Hempstead,
I wish you'd keep your mind active instead of your feet.
Well, I'm a son of a gun.
He's come back from the dead!
How are you?
Hello, Buck.
Sulfur and brimstone.
VI: Hello, Jerry.
Say, Jerry, where you been keeping yourself?
The police haven't been able to find me in my usual haunts lately, have they?
Why so low, Jerry?
Because, my dear, I'm going to be married.
What? Married!
Keep it under your hat. MAN:
Hey, Bill.
Well, you're not exactly my idea of a happy bridegroom.
