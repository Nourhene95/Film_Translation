What is it, Charlcie?
Joan, someone's waiting for you outside.
You'd better go out and see him.
What's the matter, Buck?
Has something happened to Jerry?
He's all right.
Well, where is he?
He's home.
It won't do any good to go down there, Joan.
He didn't mean to do it, Joan.
It was the excitement as much as the liquor.
But you don't understand.
This is my announcement party.
He can't do this to me.
Help me do something.
Charlcie, we've got to do something.
Isn't there anything?
Well, I did everything possible, gave him a shower and walked him all over the lakefront, but he passed out on me in the cab.
I thought maybe by the time we got over here that...
Charlcie, I can't go back in there.
I just couldn't stand the humiliation.
I simply couldn't. I couldn't.
And your mother thought you'd be president.
Why, they'd never even let you be vice president, do you hear?
Not even vice president!
Don't worry, Joan.
I'll take care of everything in the house.
What do I care about those people now.
I know, Joan, but you'd be a fool to care about Jerry now.
Any girl would have to be utterly mad about a man to marry him after this.
At any rate, he showed up for the wedding.
Honey, it's all right.
I love you so much it doesn't matter.
You go down to the store and get some canned chicken.
We're rich!
I'm glad that you like it. I do.
It's perfect.
But now, look here, there are one or two suggestions
I've got to make for my part. I know you won't mind.
Now then, in the first act, when I come on...
Well, it'd be much better if instead of coming on with DeBrion, I came on alone, huh?
You see, it'd be a much better entrance for me, and I think it'd improve your play, too.
Don't worry about her.
I can take care of her, all right.
Then, in the second act...
Hold this a minute, will you?
Don't you think it'd be much better if the curtain were built up for me a little?
And if you could find a way of getting DeBrion off the stage beforehand so that I could be alone, I think it'd be much more effective.
Look, let me show you.
Have you done it?
All right, all right, that'll do.
Now, Jane, I'm all right. You run along and do as I told you.
Very well, Miss Claire.
Oh, dear, dear.
I was just going to knock.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
JANE: You did frighten me.
Well, I don't wonder you frightened her.
You're such a rare visitor.
Is that a reproof?
Yes, it is, decidedly.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) MAN: Five minutes, Miss Hempstead.
All right. I'll be there.
Well, how do you feel with the curtain going up on your first play?
Like Napoleon before Austerlitz, or before Waterloo.
You'd better have a little drink.
You know I'm on the wagon again.
Well, if the strain becomes too great, you'll find a bottle in the closet there.
Jerry, why did you suddenly decide to visit me?
Just to wish you good luck.
Dear, why are you treating me with this devotion?
Devotion?
Well, about as much devotion as I'd show to a boa constrictor.
Is it because I treated you badly once?
I didn't think you knew that you had.
I was young and egotistical, Jerry.
Well, what are you now?
Young and egotistical.
It wasn't all my fault, you know.
No? You were very young and romantic in those days.
Perhaps if you'd been then what you are now...
Well, I might be almost as much afraid to visit you as you're afraid to visit me.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) MAN: Curtain, Miss Hempstead.
All right, I'm coming.
Well, Jerry, this is your big moment.
To Waterloo.
To Austerlitz.
JANE: Miss Claire.
All right, I'm coming.
Madam, have you no answer for me?
Sir, if I said yes, I should mean no, and if I said no, I should mean yes, but my silence is all true and for you.
It's your husband's play.
Applaud! I can't.
I'm too happy.
You have a funny way of showing it.
I always cry when I'm happy.
CROWD: Author!
Author! Author! Author!
I'm going back to see Jerry. MAN 3:
Jerry! Jerry, I'm so happy!
Hello, Claire.
Jerry, Jerry, come on, they're calling you.
He can't go out there in his condition.
Yes, he'll be all right.
He can't.
He certainly can take a bow for his own play.
He isn't going to.
I can't take a bow for my own play?
Come on. He's standing up straight.
No one will notice.
Come on, Jerry.
You go on home, get things ready.
I'm gonna bring the gang up.
Stay with him, will you?
Don't you worry.
I won't even let him out of my sight.
MAN: Speech, Jerry!
Speech!
Shall I remain here, Mrs. Corbett?
No, I'll call you when they come. Very well.
My dear, you lied to me when I arrived today.
Lied?
You said Jerry wasn't drinking.
He hasn't been.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: It is now 2:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time.
Buck, is he hurt?
He's still alive, but the couple of bottles of Scotch are dead.
JOAN: Bring him in here.
Wait for me downstairs, driver.
Yes, sir. Whom was he with, Buck?
No one in particular, just hither and yon.
There was no stopping him.
If he does, maybe he'll snap out of it.
Yes, I'm sure he will.
Thanks awfully, Buck.
Joan, I... I'm terribly sorry, but...
I don't want anyone to be sorry.
Okay, Joan.
I'll say...
Thanks, Claire.
PRENTICE:
PRENTICE: I want to speak to you.
You're coming back to Chicago with me.
Do you mean to tell me you're really happy?
Father, I've got to talk about it.
I've been nearly crazy keeping it all to myself.
I did lie to you before.
Joan, he isn't worth your little finger.
Don't say that. It isn't true.
Just think of all those months in Chicago when he didn't drink.
Just think of the marvelous fight he's put up.
He only started drinking when we came to New York and he met...
He needs me now, and I'd be selfish to leave him.
Maybe you think it's none of my business.
I love Jerry, love him, do you hear?
And it doesn't make any difference what someone is or does or anything when you love him.
I'm sorry, Joan, but even if you love him, you can't go on like this.
I could never leave Jerry.
You can't be a doormat.
I'm not a doormat!
You don't know how sweet and fine Jerry really is.
Perhaps you're right.
It is none of your business.
Please, Joan, don't...
I didn't mean to. You didn't mean to.
Nobody means to.
They do their best to make trouble between Jerry and me at every chance.
If they'd let us alone, we'd be all right.
Goodbye, Joan.
I've done all I can.
When you come to your senses, come home to me.
Joan?
I just wanted to be sure you got home safely.
What would you say if I said I was coming over to see you now?
Well, you might at least answer me.
Sir, if I said yes, I should mean no, and if I said no, I should mean yes.
But my silence is all true and for you.
I want terribly to see you, Claire, but I'm not going to do it.
I'm going to say goodbye.
JERRY: Joan!
What's the idea, Joan?
This is the way you look when you're drunk.
Just wanted to show you how you look when you're drunk.
Honey, you've got the words, but not the tune.
But you're charming when you're tight, Joanie.
Really, Joan, you don't know how charming you really are.
Really, Joan, you ought to get tight oftener.
Well, dear, merrily we go to hell.
Merrily you go to your girlfriend.
Listen, Joan, you're right.
I was going to her.
I'm still going to her unless you stop me.
I won't stop you.
If you love me, you will.
Joanie, you know I think you're the swellest person in the world.
If you love me, you'll lock that door so that I can't get out.
You mean that?
I'm no jailer.
Shut the door, Joan, or I will go.
Get out.
Get out!
Joan!
Get out!
I thought you'd be packed.
Packed and gone.
I don't have to tell you why.
You mean because you didn't come home last night?
Don't be silly.
The way you talk, one would think we were living in my grandmother's day.
No woman could forgive a man for doing what I did to you.
Your fault?
I opened the door and told you to go.
You know, I wish you hadn't, Joan.
You know, I think that you are the swellest girl that any man could ask for a wife.
Now that I've started this thing with Claire, I...
Well, I have no right to ask you to forgive me.
My grandmother wouldn't have.
And rightly.
Do you want me to go, Jerry?
You'd be an awful fool if you stayed.
No, I wouldn't.
It happens I spent the morning realizing that we're living in a modern world where there's no place for old-fashioned wives.
You seem to want a modern wife, and that's what I'm going to be.
In other words, I'm going to unpack my trunks.
You see, I'd rather go merrily to hell with you than alone.
Joan, I always said you were swell.
Perhaps you won't think so much longer, because if being a modern husband gives you privileges, then being a modern wife gives me privileges.
I'm not worried, honey.
I've told you before, you've got the words but not the tune.
Don't forget, I have a musical ear and can pick up tunes easily.
I'll have to hurry.
I just made a luncheon date with your modern friend, Charlie Baxter.
He's been after me for a long time to have lunch with him.
Joan... I'll phone you later.
Perhaps we'll dine together.
BUCK: Hey!
Let that window alone, will you?
JERRY:
What this country needs is less ventilation and more smoke.
Come on, babe.
Jerry, there's your wife.
Hello, Jerry.
Hello. I say, do you happen to know your namesake, Mrs. Corbett?
Yes, sir, there's no doubt of it.
She's a distant relative of mine.
It's my wife.
I'm sorry. I should have connected you.
I had no idea you were coming here tonight.
I had no idea you were coming here.
Where'd you dine?
We didn't. We were at Tony's, and the idea of food was revolting.
Where's our charming host?
He's sleeping behind the bar there.
Shall we join him?
Sure. I'll be seeing you, Jerry.
Mrs. Corbett's a pretty little woman, isn't she?
It's easy, look.
Like this, like that, pull, finished.
How's that?
BARTENDER: One more for the lady.
Say, Joan, what do you say we go to Harlem?
I say no.
I thought you weren't coming back to me.
I say yes.
Hurray!
To the ladies.
They keep their hearts and change their minds.
Oh, no. We keep our minds, but change our hearts.
Gentlemen, I give you the holy state of matrimony, modern style.
Single lives, twin beds and triple bromides in the morning.
(ALL LAUGHING) Okay.
By the way, has anyone here heard about the depression?
What depression?
The very charming depression between your shoulder blades, my dear.
You're tickling me.
Joan, let's finish this dance.
I'd love to.
WOMAN: It's marvelous the way you keep it up, Joan.
I never want to stop.
The floor's awfully crowded.
All right, but the next time a woman tells me she never wants to stop...
What's the matter, lady?
Something's been the matter with me lately.
I think I'm going to faint.
Oh, no, you won't.
DOCTOR: I repeat, Mrs. Corbett.
You're in a very bad physical condition.
Very bad.
You should have complete rest and relaxation.
I should say it was your only chance to...
Yes, I understand, Doctor.
I don't think there's anything more I can do for you tonight.
No, Doctor.
Thank you for coming. Not at all.
Good night.
Doctor gone?
Well, here's the bracer you wanted.
I don't want it, Vi.
I'm on the water wagon.
Doctor's orders? Yes.
He said I need rest and relaxation.
Well, there's your rest and relaxation.
Vi, do you remember once telling me to get out in time?
That you can become cheaper through loving someone than through hating someone?
Well, I didn't get out in time, but I'm going to tell Jerry something tonight.
You'd better wait until tomorrow.
No, I've waited too long already.
The bride, the bride.
Hello, darling.
I didn't think you were coming home for hours yet.
I changed my mind.
Well, I'm terribly glad you're here.
We ran out of liquor.
Jerry, come with me.
There's something I've got to tell you.
In a minute, darling.
I can't neglect my guests, you know?
Buck didn't give us time to say good evening.
Do you know, I was voted the most popular man in college when I told them I'd just gotten in a new case.
What this country needs is more people who've just gotten in a new case.
Step right in here, gentlemen, and even ladies.
Have one on the house.
You know, it's an old American custom.
I'll be right with you.
Jerry, listen to me.
There's something that I've been trying to tell you.
Wait a minute, sweet.
I'm all burdened down here, you know.
Jerry, I've been trying to get you to listen to me, and now you've got to.
Darling, no one's gonna tell me that I've got to listen.
I want you to understand, this is not my regular job.
In real life, I'm a rainmaker with the umbrella concessions.
Hello, Buck and Vi.
That's the stuff.
MAN 1: Hey, Jerry, hold it!
Camera!
Stop Jerry from making a fool of himself!
Talk to him! I'm tired of getting blue in the face.
Joan, will you have a little drink?
JERRY:
There you are. There you are.
What's going on in here?
Darling, Claire's going into the movies.
We've just been shooting the first scene.
What a shame I missed it.
Perhaps you'll do it again for me.
With pleasure, Mrs. Corbett, I'd love to reenact the scene.
Now, what I want from you children is adult passion!
Okay, Director.
MAN 1:
That's great. Hold it.
Action! MAN 2: Good boy, Jerry.
Hey, cut.
Cut! Do you want the reel to burn?
That's good.
Marvelous.
Personally, I think it must be very difficult to be married to such an ardent young man.
He thinks I'm swell.
I do, darling.
Isn't that what I always tell you?
Jerry, you should be more expressive than that.
He'll have every chance to be more expressive from now on!
You're being rude to your guests, one in particular.
I'd had an awful lot to drink, Joan.
I'll never bring her here again.
You can bring her here all you want.
Besides, we did have an agreement not to be jealous of each other.
My grandmother would have thought that a very silly agreement, and I've discovered she would have been right.
Besides, I can't be jealous of someone I've never really had.
I mean you.
Now, that isn't true.
Except for a short while after we were married.
You started drinking because of Claire Hempstead.
Well, that's true enough.
And you started drinking again when you met her again.
I stayed with you because I thought you had loved me and would again.
Now I know you never did because you married me with her image in your mind.
In all the time we've been together, you've never once said, "I love you."
You'll never know how much I've wanted to hear you say that.
Yes, and there's something else I've been trying to tell you all evening, and now you'll never know.
Joan, you're crazy.
You know that I think you're... if you say that word to me once more, I think I'll kill you!
I'm going to my father, who's always loved me.
I'm going with you.
The one thing you can do for me is to stay just where you are.
I'm going.
Good night, old man.
Good night, Jerry.
That's the best thing she ever...
MAN 1: Be up to your place later?
MAN 2: You coming or not?
I'll be up later.
Don't you feel the need of a little drink?
I'm sorry I got you into this, Claire.
Sorrier that you ever got me into it.
You do need a drink.
You've fed me enough liquor.
What's happened to you?
Something you wouldn't understand.
Just a few words that Joan said to me, enough to make me understand why I drink, and you can't realize how knowing that gives me a weapon against it.
The only thing worse than a drunkard is a reformed drunkard.
Be yourself, Jerry.
I am myself for the first time.
That's why you don't recognize me. That's why you don't understand that I don't want ever to see you again.
Ever, as long as you live, do you hear?
Yes, I hear.
In fact, my organs of hearing are very good.
In other words, don't shout at me.
Well, I feel like shouting.
I want you to know just where I stand with myself.
I'm not interested.
And I want you to know just where you stand with me.
You don't mean a thing to me, and the funny thing is, I never knew it until a few moments ago.
You should have been grateful to find it out.
I am grateful.
Yes, I'm grateful this whole thing's happened because if I had never met you again,
You really should save those speeches for your plays.
Yes, see you later.
What this country needs is fewer blondes.
We got them all out, Jerry, and we're going now.
I'm the one that's going.
Where to?
I'm gonna find someone and say three words to her I should have been saying all along.
That's what this country needs, more men who know when they've been wrong.
Three little words that I should have been saying to her all along.
Corbett's not the man he used to be, is he?
Well, why should he be?
He had a hit, went on the razzle-dazzle, and now he's just back where he started, broke and minus a wife.
I'd like to speak to Mrs. Corbett, please.
This is Mr. Hotchkiss calling.
It's for Miss Joan again, sir.
He says it's Mr. Hotchkiss.
Tell him...
No, I'll tell him myself.
It's time you learned Joan won't talk to you no matter what name you give.
I want the flowers sent there again.
But I can't keep on sending them there and getting them back, sending them there and getting them back.
I'll address another envelope.
This is Mr. Simpson calling.
Didn't read my column this morning, did you?
I never read your column, Damery.
Still, here's an item that might interest you.
Miss, is that Mrs. Corbett's room?
No, but you can ask the floor nurse at the end of the corridor.
Could I see him?
JERRY: (CHUCKLING) Cute, isn't he?
Miss, could you tell me where Mrs. Corbett's room is?
The third door to the left.
Third.
I'm too happy to glare back, Prentice.
Haven't you done enough to her?
You're not going to see her.
Yes, I am. I've a right to see her now.
You're no father.
Your baby is dead.
It's no lie.
Your baby died...
two hours after it was born, and whether Joan will live or...
If she doesn't, you will have killed her.
Don't you suppose I know that?
I don't care whether you know it or not.
I only know that if she dies, well, I'll kill you.
If she dies, you won't have to.
You're not going in there.
Yes, I am. Joan needs me now.
You're not going in there.
She stuck to me when I needed her, and she needs me now.
You're not going in.
Get out of the way, Prentice.
I swear if you don't get out of the way, I'll knock you down.
Let me tell her you're here.
Feeling better, dear?
Dad, I want Jerry.
I must have Jerry.
Please send for him.
She doesn't want to see you.
Dad, please send for Jerry.
I'm here, Joanie.
I love you so, Joanie.
I love you so much, so much.
The channel's here on the chart.
So are the marking lights.
Then what's wrong with them?
Those lights don't seem to be in just the right place.
They're both a bit out of position, according to this.
Two light buoys mean a safe channel between the world over. "Safe between the world over" doesn't go in these waters.
Look here. You'll see the water shoals on the island side... while the deep soundings run to the mainland.
Have any of you seen the captain today?
- No. He wasn't down for dinner.
- No, and he wasn't down for lunch. He hasn't left the bridge since you decided to come through the channel.
What are you driving at?
Ever since you gave him those orders yesterday to cut through these waters... he's had the jitters.
There's something wrong. I... Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.
Doc, what do you recommend for nerves?
- Give him a shot of scotch. - Give the whole bottle. - No!
I've got nerves too.
- Here you are, Doc.
Just what you need.
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening, sir.
- May I speak with you?
- Why, certainly. Go ahead. We're heading straight for the channel between Branca Island and the mainland.
- Good. - But the lights are just a bit off, according to the chart.
The charts are never up to date in this part of the Pacific.
You know that. I know, sir, but...
Doesn't Branca Island mean anything to you?
- Well, not a lot.
- Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford...
Bob's not a sailor. He's a hunter.
He's made many of these trips.
He's young, but he has judgment.
Bob! - What is it? - Come up here, will ya?
- Just a minute.
What's bothering you, Captain? There are no more coral-reefed, shark-infested waters in the whole world than these.
Boy!
Just take a look at these. You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter, Doc, but oh, what a photographer.
If we'd had you to take pictures on the Sumatran trip... they might have believed my book.
If you'd had me on the Sumatran trip, you'd have never had me on this one.
Say, here's a swell one of the ship, Skipper.
What's the matter? These old sea dogs tell yarns to kid each other... and end up believing it all themselves.
I think that Mr. Rainsford should know... that the channel lights aren't just in the position given on the charts.
Oh. Well, what do you think, fellas?
I think we should turn back and take the outside course.
We'll go ahead. Very well, sir.
"It was the schooner 'Hesperus,' and she sailed the wintry sea."
Now, wait a minute, fellas. Let's talk this over.
- There's no use taking any chances.
- Chances? That's fine talk... coming from a fella who just got through slapping tigers in the face.
Get an eyeful of this.
And he talks about taking chances.
Here's the doc charging the enemy with an unloaded camera.
Get the expression on Doc's face, Bill.
He looks more frightened than the tiger.
- He is. - What'd you have on your mind, Doc?
I'll tell you what I had on my mind.
I was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization.
The beast of the jungle killing just for his existence is called savage.
The man, killing just for sport, is called civilized.
- It's a bit contradictory, isn't it?
Now, just a minute. What makes you think... it isn't just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man?
Take that fellow right there, for instance.
There never was a time when he couldn't have gotten away.
He didn't want to.
He got interested in hunting me.
He didn't hate me for stalking him... any more than I hated him for trying to charge me.
As a matter of fact, we admired each other.
Perhaps, but would you change places with the tiger?
- Well, not now.
- Mm-mm!
Here comes that bad-luck lady again. Third time tonight.
- Here.
Let me shuffle them. - Wait a minute.
Don't evade the issue. - Yeah, speak up.
- I asked you a question.
- You did? I forgot.
- Oh, no, you didn't. I asked you if there'd be as much sport in the game... if you were the tiger instead of the hunter.
- What's your answer now, Bob? That's something I'll never have to decide.
Listen here, you fellows. This world's divided into two kinds of people... the hunter and the hunted.
Luckily, I'm a hunter.
Nothing can ever change that.
Hello! Hello, down there!
- The panel is flooded! - If the water hits those hot boilers...
Where are the others?
See anybody?
Doc!
Ohh!
It got me!
Hello! Is anybody here?
Anybody around, I say.
Oh, hello.
Is this your house?
I'm not trying to break in, but I've been in a wreck.
Our yacht just sunk with all hands.
I got ashore and found your place here by accident.
I'm not trying to intrude, but I'm in sort of a jam.
Don't you understand any English?
Ivan does not speak any language.
He has the misfortune to be dumb.
Oh, hello.
Are you the owner here?
Yes. Welcome to my poor fortress.
- Fortress?
- It once was.
Built by the Portuguese, centuries ago.
I have had the ruins restored to make my home here.
I am Count Zaroff.
My name's Robert Rainsford. Glad to meet you.
Very glad.
Ivan is a Cossack.
I am afraid, like all my fellow countrymen, he is a bit of a savage.
Smile, Ivan.
I was trying to make him understand there'd been a shipwreck in the channel.
But how appalling! And you mean to say that you are the only survivor?
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
You're certain?
I'd have never left the spot if I hadn't been. The swellest crowd on Earth...
my best friends.
- It's incredible.
- Such things are always incredible.
Death is for others, not for ourselves.
That is how most of my other guests have felt.
Your other guests?
You mean this has happened before?
My fellow, we have several survivors from the last wreck still in the house.
It would seem that this island were cursed.
That's just what the captain said.
Only he thought it was uninhabited.
We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude.
- Well, it's a break for me, anyway.
- My house is yours.
Oh, by the way. You'll want to change those wet rags immediately.
Yes. They look about the way I feel.
I have some loose hunting clothes which I keep for my guests... that you can possibly get into.
Ivan will show you to your room.
- You'll find a stiff drink there also.
Thanks a lot.
All pleasure is mine.
- Ready, Rainsford? - All set.
I'm afraid we have finished dinner.
But I have ordered something for you.
Thanks. I don't feel like eating, though. Oh.
Well, perhaps later.
Now, then, what do you say to coffee... and most charming company?
It is hard to forget your comrades' fate, I know... but our feminine guest is easily perturbed.
If I could beg you to put a good face upon the matter.
A-Assume a cheerfulness you may not feel.
- Why, sure.
Of course. - Thank you.
Miss Trowbridge, may I present Mr. Robert Rainsford.
- Miss Eve Trowbridge.
- And her brother, Mr. Martin Trowbridge.
How are you, old chap? Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?
- Coming out of it now, thanks.
- We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?
Indeed we do.
Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like some hot coffee.
Oh, yes, of course. Mr. Rainsford, please sit here.
Vodka, that's the stuff!
One shot'll dry you out quicker than all the coffee in Java.
Have to toss it off, though. Like this.
Now, Martin, you don't have to drink it all tonight, do you?
Don't be ridiculous, sis. We are victims of circumstance.
Same as Mr. Rainsford.
And if anyone has a right to his liquor, it's a victim of circumstance. - Isn't that so, Count?
- Of course, yes.
- You were in a shipwreck too?
Our lifeboat was the only one saved... my brother and I and two sailors.
The count found us on the beach with nothing but the clothes on our backs.
Those channel lights must have been shifted.
- I wonder it hasn't been reported.
- Well, we'll report 'em... just as soon as we get back to the mainland.
You see, the count has only one launch... and that's under repair.
Russians are not the best mechanics.
I'm afraid we'll have to be patient a few days longer.
It's all right with me. I feel as if I were living on borrowed time right now.
Speaking of that, perhaps now you'll tell us... a little bit about who you are.
Just sketchily, you know...
born, married, why I left my last job.
No, no, no, no. One moment, please.
Mr. Rainsford need never explain who he is in my house.
We entertain a celebrity, Miss Trowbridge.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I know. Flagpole sitter.
He wrote some books.
- No, he lived some books.
If I am not mistaken, this is Mr. Robert Rainsford... who hunts big game so adventurously.
Yeah? Here's to ya.
- I've lugged a gun around a little.
- "I've lugged a gun around a little."
No, I have read your books. I read all books on hunting.
- A papiroso?
Only in yours have I found a sane point of view.
- What do you mean, "sane"? - Cigarette?
- Hmm? Yeah.
Thanks.
- You do not excuse what needs no excuse. Let me see.
How did you put it?
"Hunting is as much a game as stud poker... only the limits are higher."
- You have put our case perfectly. - Then you're a hunter yourself?
We are kindred spirits.
It is my one passion.
He sleeps all day and hunts all night.
And what's more, Rainsford, he'll have you doing the same thing.
We'll have capital sport together, I hope.
Don't encourage him.
He's had our two sailors so busy... chasing around the woods after flora and fauna... that we haven't seen them for three days.
But what do you hunt here?
I'll tell you.
You will be amused, I know.
I have done a rare thing.
I have invented a new sensation.
Yeah, and is he stingy with it.
What is this sensation, Count?
Mr. Rainsford, God made some men poets.
Some He made kings, some beggars.
Me, He made a hunter.
My hand was made for the trigger, my father told me.
He was a very rich man... with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.
When I was only still up high he gave me my first gun.
- Good for him. - My life has been one glorious hunt.
It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed.
- But when the revolution...
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Count Zaroff was so interesting... I didn't realize the danger.
Oh, it's all right now.
What were you saying about the revolution, Count?
Oh, merely that I escaped with most of my fortune.
Naturally, I continued to hunt all over the world.
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo gave me this.
That must have been a close call. Yes.
It still bothers me sometimes.
However, in two months I was on my way to the Amazon.
I'd heard that the jaguars there were unusually cunning.
No sport at all.
One night, as I lay in my tent with this... this head of mine... a terrible thought crept like a snake into my brain.
Hunting was beginning to bore me.
Is that such a terrible thought, Count?
It is, my dear lady, when hunting has been the whip for all other passions.
When I lost my love of hunting... I lost my love of life...
of love.
Well, you seem to have stood it pretty well.
I even tried to sink myself to the level of the savage.
I made myself perfect in the use of the Tartar war bow.
Tartar which?
Tartar war bow...
It's cute.
Even to this day I prefer to hunt with it... but alas, even that was too deadly.
What I needed was not a new weapon... but a new animal.
- A new animal?
- Exactly so.
You found one?
Here on my island...
"The most dangerous game"?
You mean tigers?
Tigers?
The tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs.
I heard some queer beast howling back there along the water.
Was that it?
It's no use, Rainsford. He won't tell.
He won't even let you see his trophy room... till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit.
My one secret.
I keep it as a surprise for my guests... against the rainy day of boredom.
You let me in on that game... and I'll bet you I go for it.
You know, Rainsford, he hasn't failed yet.
If he says a thing is good, it is good.
He's a judge of liquor, wizard at contract... plays the piano... anything you want.
He's a good host and a good scholar, eh, Count?
Yes, yes.
You want me to go hunting? You just say the word. We're pals.
We'll have a big party, get cockeyed and go hunting.
A completely civilized point of view.
